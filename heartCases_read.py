'''
heartCases is a medical language processing system for case reports 
involving cardiovascular disease (CVD).

This part of the system is intended for parsing MEDLINE format files 
and specifically isolating those relevant to CVD using terms in titles 
and in MeSH terms.

Requires numpy, nltk, and sklearn.

Uses the Disease Ontology project database; see
http://www.disease-ontology.org/ or Kibbe et al. (2015) NAR.

Uses the 2017 MeSH Data Files provided by the NIH NLM.
These files are used without modification.

This script attempts to expand on existing MeSH annotations by performing
tag classification with MeSH terms and adding terms to records where
appropriate. These terms can optionally include just those used to search
records (e.g., if only terms related to heart disease are provided,
a classifier will be trained only to add those terms when missing.)
Similar approaches have been employed by Huang et al. (2011) JAMIA:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3168302/
(Huang et al. used a k-nearest neighbors approach to get related articles
and their highest-ranking MeSH terms. They achieved ~71% recall on 
average.)

Both previously present and newly added annotations
are used to further annotate records with relevant ICD-10 disease codes.

**INPUT:
Text files containing literature references in MEDLINE format.
Files to process must be placed in the "input" folder.

**OUTPUT:
A text file (out_file_medline.txt) containing literature references 
in MEDLINE format, such that all references match the given 
search terms. 
The output file includes ICD-10 codes added as Other Terms (OT)
where possible.
Counts of matched MeSH terms are also provided.
Records without MeSH terms are not included in the output file or counts.
Abstracts are saved to files labeled with their corresponding PMIDs
in the folder training_text. One file contains one abstract with
MeSH terms, delimited by |, a tab, the abstract text, a tab, and the PMID.
