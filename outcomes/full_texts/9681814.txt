We report a case of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) producing renal cell carcinoma. A 53-year-old man with fever was found to have a left renal mass
on computed tomography. No mass was detected in the liver. Serum AFP was 1,460 ng/ml. Radical nephrectomy showed a 10 cm mass in the upper
half. A half of the tumor was whitish yellow and firm whereas another half was soft and bright yellow with hemorrhagic and necrotic areas.
Histologically, the two areas were different. The lower part consisted of the clear cell renal cell carcinoma and the upper part consisted
of granular cells. On immunohistochemistry, the granular tumor cells only were positive for AFP. Serum AFP level dropped abruptly to 383
ng/ml on the 6th postoperative day and gradually returned to normal during the 6 months. Multiple metastatic nodules were found in the
lungs, liver and bone in 9th postoperative month and the AFP was less than 1 ng/ml. This suggest metastatic lesions are non-AFP producing
clear cell type. It can be concluded that serum AFP elevation was due to synthesis by the renal cell carcinoma in the absence of liver
neoplasm. Although AFP producing renal cell carcinoma is a rare entity, serum AFP can be a useful marker for the detection of the tumor.
