the diagnosis of hepatobiliary disorders. Due to their anatomic situation, a substantial percentage of malignancies located near the hilus
is not suitable for surgical management. We discuss an effective palliative intervention to relieve jaundice. In many instances drainage is
a superior choice when biliodigestive anastomoses are not technically feasible and palliative resection carries a high complication rate. We
present an irrigatable exo-endodrainage method employing a modified port-a-cath system as a new alternative. In four patients, all older
than 75 years, this system was implanted because of jaundice due to unresectable malignant stenosis of the extrahepatic bile duct. One
patient (80 years old) died of pre-existing acute necrotizing pancreatitis, although hyperbilirubinemia was found to decrease on the 7th
postoperative day. The other three patients showed complete normalization of their bilirubin levels and their port-a-cath systems remained
open until their death (at 3 weeks, 6 months and 7 months respectively).
