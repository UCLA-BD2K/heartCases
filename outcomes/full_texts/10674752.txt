lakes in the hepatic parenchyma. It has been associated with various pharmacological agents and infections. Treatment has been primarily
symptomatic and includes discontinuation of offending medications, partial hepatectomy or occasionally liver transplantation. We report a 58
year old white female on hormone replacement therapy who developed symptomatic peliosis hepatis and underwent successful superselective
hepatic artery embolization with control of bleeding.
