Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was recovered from cerebrospinal cells (but not from cell-free fluid) of a patient with meningoencephalitis
complicating infectious mononucleosis. This finding suggests that virus-altered B lymphocytes can invade the central nervous system and may
play a direct role in the pathogenesis of neurologic sequelae of EBV infections. Several mechanisms by which these cells can cause
neurologic manifestations are discussed.
