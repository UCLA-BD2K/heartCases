portal vein aneurysm during an evaluation for hematuria is reported. Extrahepatic portal vein aneurysms are rare with only twenty cases
reported in the literature. Typically, patients present with hemorrhage requiring surgical exploration or the aneurysm is discovered during
evaluation of another abdominal process. Management includes careful follow-up in the asymptomatic patient without underlying liver disease
or portal hypertension.
