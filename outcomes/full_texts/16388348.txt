Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is a well defined entity, however it is characterised by a relevant clinical heterogeneity. The main
feature is orthostatic headache, often accompanied by other symptoms. The diagnosis is easily made in the presence of orthostatic headache,
excluding an obvious aetiology of low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, and often there is no evidence of direct or indirect CSF leak.
