Primary malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors(MPNST) of the vulva are extremely rare and most of them are composed of a spindle cell
component. A few cases of MPNST containing partially or purely epithelioid cells have been reported. Purely epithelioid MPNST differ from
the ordinary epithelioid MPNST due to the absence of a spindle cell component. We present the first case of purely epithelioid MPNST arising
in the vulva reviewing in the world literature without definite evidence of von Recklinghausen's disease or nerve involvement. The patient
was a 63-year-old woman with a palpable vulvar mass, 6 x 4 x 1.5 cm in dimension, was not encapsulated but well-demarcated, ovoid and
rubbery and showed pale yellow, homogeneous, fish-flesh appearance with focal cystic changes on cut surface. The histologic features
consisted of solely epithelioid cells which were arranged in tight clusters or cords with solid growing pattern and focally scattered
rosette-like structures. According to the immunohistochemical results, most of tumor cells were strongly positive for neuron specific
enolase, and some of them were weakly positive for S-100 protein and vimentin. We considered that purely epithelioid MPNST would represent a
certain degree of differentiation toward nerve or neuronal cells rather than Schwann cells.
