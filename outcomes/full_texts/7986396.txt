A 37 year-old-woman was admitted to the hospital because of 15 days' duration of continuous fever. Routine studies for detection of fever
foci were negative. Imaging studies revealed giant hemangioma of the liver with central thrombosis. The fever persisted for a period of 4
weeks, and subsided after conservative management. We report a case of hepatic hemangioma presenting with fever of unknown origin. The
condition is very rare, but should be regarded as one of the causes of fever of unknown origin.
