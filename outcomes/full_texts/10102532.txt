A 10-year-old male patient affected by type 2 von Willebrand disease (vWD) and his family members were investigated by hemostatic and
molecular genetic studies. The propositus, who experienced frequent bleeding episodes, was characterized by a normal level of von Willebrand
factor (vWF) antigen (54%), reduced vWF ristocetin cofactor activity (5%), decreased factor VIII clotting activity (25%) and absent high
molecular weight multimers in the plasma. An exon 28 fragment coding for the A1 and A2 domains was amplified by polymerase chain reaction
and sequenced. We found a heterozygous mutation (G4022A), producing an additional PstI restriction site, which resulted in the substitution
of Arg578Gln. Family studies, including the parents and a brother, were negative for this mutation and vWF abnormalities were not observed.
We confirmed that G to A mutation in the region of the platelet glycoprotein Ib binding domain of vWF causes the qualitative type 2 defect
in von Willebrand disease.
