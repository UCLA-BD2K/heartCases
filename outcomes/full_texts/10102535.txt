Acute pancreatitis in cancer patients can be secondary to the malignant process itself or a complication of antineoplastic agent
administration. However, acute pancreatitis caused by metastatic carcinoma of the pancreas is an uncommon condition with a poor prognosis.
We report a case of a 63-year-old man with small cell carcinoma of the lung, who developed acute pancreatitis lately. Thirteen months
earlier, he developed small cell carcinoma of the lung and received 6 cycles of chemotherapy. Abdominal CT scan showed swelling of the
pancreas with multiple masses. The patient was managed conservatively and pancreatitis subsided. This case indicates that metastasis induced
acute pancreatitis can be a manifestation of lung cancer, especially in small cell carcinoma.
