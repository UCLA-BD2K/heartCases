complications following hepatic trauma. Large fistulas can result in portal hypertension and cardiovascular compromise. A 46-year-old
patient is described who presented with portal hypertension, variceal bleeding, and high output cardiac failure due to a large intrahepatic
APF. Surgical closure of the APF by hepatic resection successfully resolved the portal hypertension, prevented further variceal hemorrhage,
and restored normal cardiovascular function.
