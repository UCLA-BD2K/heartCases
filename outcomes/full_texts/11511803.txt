Extraadrenal paragangliomas involving the spine is less common and usually takes the form of intradural compression of the cauda equina. The
authors report three cases of spinal paragangliomas resulting in extradural spinal cord compression and their MR findings. The MR imaging
revealed a well-demarcated extradural mass with low to intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and intermediate to high signal
intensity on T2-weighted images compared to paravertebral muscles. After Gd-DTPA administration, heterogeneous and intense enhancement was
found. Multiple punctate and serpiginous structures of signal void due to high-velocity flow were noted around and within the tumors on all
sequences. In one case, the signal void structures were well corresponded with feeding arteries on angiography. These may be the
characteristic findings of the extraadrenal paraganglioma involving the spine.
