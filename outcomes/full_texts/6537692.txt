A 45-year-old female developed hypertension and hypokalemia. Elevated plasma aldosterone and suppressed plasma renin levels were measured
with no evidence for glucocorticoid or androgen abnormalities. A left adrenal tumor was removed that showed histologic criteria for
malignancy. It is commonly taught that malignant adrenal tumors are recognized by their multiple hormone production. However, isolated
aldosterone production by a carcinoma can occur and requires close follow-up observation and therapy for this highly malignant tumor.
