Myasthenia gravis and pemphigus are both considered to have an autoimmune basis. Although immunological and clinical studies have been
performed on large numbers of patients with myasthenia gravis, the coexistence of myasthenia gravis and pemphigus foliaceus has rarely been
described. We recently have the opportunity to study a 33-year-old female patient having both of these autoimmune diseases confirmed by
various diagnostic methods. This rare coexistence of myasthenia gravis and pemphigus foliaceus has not been previously documented in Korea.
