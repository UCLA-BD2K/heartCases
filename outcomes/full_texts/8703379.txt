It has been well known that the survivors of retinoblastoma are prone to have osteosarcoma. But the secondary tumor usually occurs in
bilateral, hereditary type of retinoblastoma. We report one case of osteosarcoma in a survivor of unilateral, sporadic retinoblastoma. A
fourteen year old male presented with a painfully swollen distal forearm of 2 month duration. He had enucleated his left eye 10 years ago
due to retinoblastoma with no other adjuvant therapy. We managed him with our conventional protocol and identified deletion of Rb gene from
his pathological specimen by using the PCR-RFLP method. This result is unusual for unilateral nonhereditable retinoblastoma and may suggest
gene level change even in sporadic cases. And Rb gene study may be helpful for unilateral, sporadic retinoblastoma patient in detecting the
possibility of late osteosarcoma.
