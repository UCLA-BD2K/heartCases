Chronic cluster headache remains refractory to medical therapy in at least 30% of those who suffer from this condition. The lack of
alternative medical therapies that are as effective as, or more effective than, lithium carbonate makes new therapies necessary for this
highly disabling condition. Based on a previous report, we gave oral anticoagulants to three patients with chronic cluster headache. Two of
them remained cluster headachefree while taking warfarin. In the third patient, the use of warfarin for three weeks initially increased the
frequency and intensity of cluster headache attacks but subsequently induced a prolonged remission. In spite of the paucity of data
available, oral anticoagulation appears to be a promising therapy for chronic cluster headache.
