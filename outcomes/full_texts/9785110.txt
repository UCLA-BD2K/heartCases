BACKGROUND: Although congenital syphilis usually occurs as a result of a failure to detect and treat syphilis in pregnant women, failures of
the currently recommended regimen to prevent congenital syphilis have been reported. CASE: This report describes an infant with congenital
syphilis despite maternal treatment with a regimen exceeding current CDC guidelines. CONCLUSION: Regardless of the regimen used to treat
syphilis during pregnancy, clinicians should recognize the possibility of occasional treatment failures and the importance of adequate
follow-up of infants at risk for congenital syphilis.
