Carcinoid tumors having distinct paranuclear clear zones seen on hematoxylin and eosin stain are rare and few cases have been reported in
the literature. Furthermore, primary hepatic carcinoid tumor with a paranuclear clear zone is extremely rare. We recently experienced a case
from a 48-year-old man who presented a large single mass, 12 cm in largest diameter, in the right lobe of the liver. Histologically, the
tumor revealed characteristic organoid pattern with central hyaline degeneration. The tumor cells had a prominent paranuclear vacuolated
dear zone. On immunohistochemistry, tumor cells were diffusely positive for synaptophysin and focally stained for chromogranin A.
Ultrastructural examination revealed paranuclear aggregation of intermediate filaments and membrane-bound clear vesicles, which corresponded
to the paranuclear vacuolated clear zone.
