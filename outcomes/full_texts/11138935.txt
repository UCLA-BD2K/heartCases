Cholera, a prototypical secretory diarrheal disease, is an ancient scourge that has both wrought great suffering and taught many valuable
lessons, from basic sanitation to molecular signal transduction. Victims experience the voluminous loss of bicarbonate-rich isotonic saline
at a rate that may lead to hypovolemic shock, metabolic acidosis, and death within afew hours. Intravenous solution therapy as we know it
was first developed in an attempt to provide life-saving volume replacement for cholera patients. Breakthroughs in epithelial membrane
transport physiology, such as the discovery of sugar and salt cotransport, have paved the way for oral replacement therapy in areas of the
world where intravenous replacement is not readily available. In addition, the discovery of the cholera toxin has yielded vital information
about toxigenic infectious diseases, providing a framework in which to study fundamental elements of intracellular signal transduction
pathways, such as G-proteins. Cholera may even shed light on the evolution and pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis, the most commonly
inherited disease among Caucasians. The goal of this paper is to review, using case studies, some of the lessons learned from cholera
throughout the ages, acknowledging those pioneers whose seminal work led to our understanding of many basic concepts in medical
epidemiology, microbiology, physiology, and therapeutics.
