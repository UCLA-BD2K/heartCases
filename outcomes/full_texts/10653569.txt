We report the first four North American cases of Candida dubliniensis fungemia, including the first isolation of this organism from the
bloodstream of an HIV-infected person. All isolates were susceptible in vitro to commonly used antifungal drugs. This report demonstrates
that C. dubliniensis can cause bloodstream infection; however, the incidence of disease is not known.
