We present a magnetic resonance imaging of a 38 old woman, admitted with clinical symptoms of expansive cerebellar lesion. No mural nodule
and no enhancement after gadolinium injection were noted. She was operated upon and an anatomico-pathological diagnosis of a simple cyst was
made. Cysts of the posterior fossa are common in the literature, but the simple cyst is rare. Considered in the differential diagnosis of
these cysts: (hemangioblastoma, astrocytoma cystic, hydatid cyst ...). The postoperative course was uneventful after surgery. Brain MRI,
T2-weighted axial sequence. High intensity signal. Simple cyst compressing the cerebellar vermis and fourth ventricle
