Sarcomatoid carcinoma is a rare biphasic tumor characterized by a combination of malignant epithelial and mesenchymal cells. We report a
rare case of sarcomatoid carcinoma of the colon. A 41-yr-old woman was hospitalized with a history of melena. Total colectomy was performed
under the impression of colonic carcinoma. Histologically, the tumor was composed of differentiated adenocarcinoma in superficial portion
and sarcomatoid spindle cells in deeper portion with a transitional area between the two portions. The sarcomatous areas revealed polygonal
and spindle-shaped anaplastic malignant cells arranged in sheet, short fascicular or haphazard pattern. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells
showed a positive immunoreaction for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, and vimentin. The histopathological and immunohistochemical
transitions between the adenocarcinoma area and the spindle cell area suggested that the sarcomatous elements originated from the
adenocarcinoma during tumor progression.
