The aim of the report is to present a case of an autonomic headache associated with autonomic seizures. A 19-year-old male who had had
complex partial seizures for 15 years was admitted with autonomic complaints and left hemicranial headache, independent from seizures, that
he had had for 2 years and were provoked by watching television. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed right hippocampal sclerosis and
electroencephalography revealed epileptic activity in right hemispheric areas. Treatment with valproic acid decreased the complaints. The
headache did not fulfil the criteria for the diagnosis of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, and was different from epileptic headache,
which was defined as a pressing type pain felt over the forehead for several minutes to a few hours. Although epileptic headache responds to
anti-epileptics and the complaints of the present case decreased with antiepileptics, it has been suggested that the headache could be a
nontrigeminal autonomic headache instead of an epileptic headache.
