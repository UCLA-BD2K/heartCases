A 76 year old man presented to the emergency department, Tri-Service General Hospital, Taiwan, with intermittent dull abdominal pain for
three weeks in August 2013. One reducible soft mass was found over his left flank under the ribs and enlarged when coughing. The computed
tomography (CT) of abdomen demonstrated a herniation of retroperitoneal fat through left superior lumbar space, also known as Grynfeltt
triangle (Fig. 1). He underwent lumbar oblique incision to return the hernia sac and repaired the defect by layered closure in a right
decubitus position (Fig. 2A and 2B). The patient exhibited no symptoms six months after discharge. The computed tomography of abdomen showed
retroperitoneal fat protruding through Grynfeltt's triangle (bold red arrow) bound by the 12th rib superiorly (thin red arrow), the
quadratus lumborum muscle medially (triangle), and internal oblique muscle laterally (asterisk). The operation demonstrated a soft, tympanic
and compressible herniated sac with a smooth surface (arrows). The defect was repaired by direct apposition of the internal oblique muscle
and fascia with non-absorbable sutures. Grynfeltt hernia may sometimes cause incarceration, strangulation, and bowel obstruction. Enlarged
bulging size is an important clue to differentiate from lipoma by increasing intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing. Prompt abdominal CT
and early surgical repair can prevent possible bowel ischaemia.
