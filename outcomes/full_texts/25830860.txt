We report the case of a 54-year-old male with a history of chest trauma in 2011, complicated by bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive
Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). In 2012, the patient was diagnosed with spondylodiscitis, and in 2013, he was referred to cardiology for
dyspnea. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed an aneurysm of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Transesophageal
echocardiography (TEE) confirmed the presence of the aneurysm, which caused severe valvular insufficiency. Although infective endocarditis
was never confirmed, after reviewing his medical records, the authors concluded that this condition was probably associated with mitral
valve aneurysm. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE): apical 4-chamber view – image of the calcified nodule on the posterior leaflet (P1–P2
transition), under which lies an aneurysm of the mitral valve in diastole (A) and systole (B) – white arrow. C. Transesophageal
echocardiography (TEE): mid-esophageal 5-chamber view (0°) – image of saccular aneurysm on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve (green
arrow). D. TEE: mid-esophageal 2-chamber view: severe mitral regurgitation identified by color Doppler – blue arrow.
