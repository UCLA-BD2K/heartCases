Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) is no longer a rare oddity. For the clinician, DRD poses a diagnostic challenge as its clinical presentation
can be quite diverse. Marked and sustained response to L-dopa is the most crucial and absolute hallmark in confirming a diagnosis. Absence
of degenerative nigral cell loss underlies the remarkable L-dopa response. The broadening spectrum of the clinical presentations, progress
in molecular genetics with evidence of incomplete penetrance and phenotypic variability, biochemistry, utility of nuclear imaging in
differential diagnosis, and treatment are discussed. I propose the concept of DRD as a syndrome, defined as selective nigrostriatal dopamine
deficiency caused by genetic defects in dopamine synthesis without degenerative cell loss. I further propose the term DRD-plus, defined as
inherited metabolic disorders which have symptomatic features of DRD, and those features not seen in DRD as well.
