The costs of lead-based paint hazard control in housing are well documented, but the costs of cleanup after improper, inherently dangerous,
methods of removing lead-based paint are not. In this article we report a case of childhood lead poisoning and document the costs of
decontamination after uncontained power sanding was used to remove paint down to bare wood from approximately 3,000 ft(2) of exterior siding
on a large, well-maintained 75-year-old house in a middle-income neighborhood. After the uncontrolled removal of lead-based paint, interior
dust lead levels ranged from 390 to 27,600 micro g Pb/ft(2) (on floors and windowsills) and bare soil lead levels ranged from 360 ppm in the
yard to 3,900 ppm along the foundation to 130,000 ppm in the child's play area, well above applicable U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development/U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards. The hard costs of decontamination were over $195,000, which greatly exceeds the
incremental cost of incorporating lead-safe work practices into repainting. This case report highlights the need to incorporate lead-safe
work practices into routine repainting, remodeling, and other renovation and maintenance jobs that may disturb lead-based paint.
