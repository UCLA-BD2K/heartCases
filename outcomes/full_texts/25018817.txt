A 26-year-old man, previously healthy, presented with a 6-month history of bilateral sciatic pain and frequent constipation but no urinary
symptoms. Physical examination revealed tenderness of the lumbosacral region with radiating pain along the sciatic nerve and the perinea
without motor weakness of the inferior legs. No cutaneous lesions were noted especially no caf√©-au-lait macules. Magnetic resonance imaging
of the lumbosacral area showed multiple intracanalar lesions of the lumbosacral spine causing scalloping of posterior parts of all the
sacral vertebrae and neural foraminal widening with bilateral and symmetric extension to the pelvic region. Biologic data were normal. Chest
radiography followed by computed tomography revealed an axillary thoracic tumor (5 cm on diameter) which was biopsied and histologically
identified as benign neurofibroma. Brain MRI showed no other cranial nerve tumors and there was no family history of neurocutaneous lesions.
Because the patient had mild symptoms without neurological deficits, no surgery was performed for the sacral neurofibromas. Neurofibromas
are one of the major characteristics of type 1 neurofibromatosis. They can develop from the Schwann cells or fibroblasts of any peripheral
nerve. Massive intra-extraspinal cases characterized by dumbbell neurofibromas as in our case are rare and maybe asymptomatic for a long
time. It is crucial to screen the entire spinal axis to detect all neurofibromas. Symptomatic cases justify surgical treatment but the
decision for surgery and the surgical approach is quite complex because neurofibromas occupy a large spinal and extraspinal regions.
