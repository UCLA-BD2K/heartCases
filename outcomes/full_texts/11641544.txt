Anatomical lesions of hypothalamic area associated with hypodipsic hypernatremia have been reported only rarely. We report here a case of
hypodipsic hypernatremia induced by a hypothalamic lesion. A 25-yr-old man, who had been treated with radiation for hypothalamic tumor 5-yr
before, was admitted for evaluation of hypernatremia and hypokalemia. He never felt thirst despite the elevated plasma osmolality and
usually refused to drink intentionally. Plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) level was normal despite the severe hypernatremic hyperosmolar
state and urine was not properly concentrated, while AVP secretion was rapidly induced by water deprivation and urine osmolality also
progressively increased to the near maximum concentration range. All of these findings were consistent with an isolated defect in
osmoregulation of thirst, which was considered as the cause of chronic hypernatremia in the patient without an absolute deficiency in AVP
secretion. Hypokalemia could be induced by activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system as a result of volume depletion. However,
inappropriately low values of plasma aldosterone levels despite high plasma renin activity could not induce symptomatic hypokalemia and
metabolic alkalosis. The relatively low serum aldosterone levels compared with high plasma renin activity might result from hypernatremia.
Hypernatremia and hypokalemia were gradually corrected by intentional water intake only.
