cholecystectomy and review of literature have shown that, although still rare it presents as a part of systemic miliary tuberculosis,
abdominal tuberculosis, isolated gallbladder tuberculosis and as acalculus cholecystitis in anergic patients. There are no pathognomonic
signs, the diagnosis depends on suspicion of tuberculosis, peroperative findings and histological examination.
