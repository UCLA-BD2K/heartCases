A young 15 year old boy was brought to the emergency department of ophthalmology after he have had an acute accident during a tennis game,
the ball accidently heat him in her left eye resulting palpebral edema and decreased visual acuity. In the emergency room, the ophthalmic
exam found visual acuity in the left eye at 1/20 and loss of near acuity, 10/10 in the right eye and anterior segment unremarkable. The
fundus of the eye reached found a macular hole well defined with diffuse berlin edema (A). The OCT a 489 micrometer stage 3 macular hole
(B). The patient was placed in short-term corticoid treatment and controlled one week later, the visual acuity rises to 2/10. One month
later a regular exam demonstrate a stable visual acuity at 2/10 but a much bigger macular hole on the fundus (C) and respectively in the OCT
the diameter rises to 1155 micrometer, stage 4 (D). Macular holes can be treated with surgery through a procedure called a vitrectomy. The
operation is done to remove the vitreous jelly and additional tissue that may be keeping the macular hole open. At surgery, the eye is
filled with a special gas that stays in the eye and slowly dissolves over a few weeks. The gas forms an air bubble that gently presses on
the hole and encourages new tissue to close the hole. Non-treated macular holes stabilize with vision of about 20/200. A) macular hole on
the fundus at day 1 of contusion trauma; B) corrensponding OCT at day 1 of trauma showing a stage 3 macular hole; C) macular hole evolution
after one month; D) the macular hole got bigger one month later: stage 4
