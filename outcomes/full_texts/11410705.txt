Permanent ischemic injury of the hand after radial artery cannulation is rare, but several cases of thromboembolism after the cannulation
leading to amputation of affected limb or digits have been reported. A 48-yr-old man undergoing spine surgery showed normal modified Allen's
test and had no preoperative vascular disease. We inserted 20-G radial artery catheter for the continuous monitoring of the blood flow and
serial blood sampling. There was no specific event during the operation and the catheter was removed immediately after the operation. The
signs and symptoms of the circulatory impairment of the radial artery developed four days after the operation and aggravated thereafter.
Through the angiographic study, we found the total occlusion of the radial artery and some of its branches. After an emergent surgical
exploration of the radial artery for removal of the thrombus and vein graft for the defect of the artery on the 8th postoperative day, the
ischemic signs and symptoms disappeared and the radial pulse was restored.
