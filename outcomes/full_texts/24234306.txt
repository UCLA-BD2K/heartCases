An 86-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (etiology unknown) presented with left flank pain for ten hours. She was hypotensive and
had a firm, exquisitely tender left flank mass. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a 20 cm left renal mass with extensive
fatty tissue and associated retroperitoneal hemorrhage (Fig. 1). The patient died from hemorrhagic shock. Based on the large peri-renal
fatty masses and the presence of a vessel extending into the renal parenchyma (Fig. 2), we concluded this was a kidney
angiomyolipoma.1Figure 1CT scan of the abdomen showing retroperitoneal hemorrhage (short arrows) and areas of fatty tissue (arrow

80 % occur spontaneously as in this case, while 20 % occur in association with tuberous sclerosis complex.2 As the lesions increase in size,
the vascular supply becomes aneurysmal and hemorrhage risk increases. In one study, the risk of hemorrhage in lesions larger than eight cm
was 25–50 %.3 Management is based on the size of the lesion and the presence of symptoms, with a shift toward less invasive treatments.
Arterial embolization is used to reduce the size of angiomyolipomas,4 and regrowth does not occur after successful embolization. Some
authors suggest arterial embolization if the tumor is symptomatic or greater than four cm.5 No internal or external funding sources. None.
