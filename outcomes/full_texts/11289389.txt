Acute tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) occurs frequently in hematologic malignancies such as high-grade lymphomas and acute leukemia, which are
rapidly proliferating and chemosensitive tumors. It occurs rarely in solid tumors and has never been reported in gastric adenocarcinoma.
Typical biochemical findings of acute tumor lysis syndrome are hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia in patients
with a malignancy. Rapid changes of these electrolytes may cause cardiac arrhythmia, seizure, acute renal failure and sudden death.
Therefore, as soon as it is detected, it should be taken care of immediately. Until now almost all cases of TLS associated with solid tumor
have developed after cytoreductive therapy in chemosensitive tumors. We report here a case of spontaneous acute tumor lysis in a patient of
advanced gastric cancer with hepatic metastases and multiple lymphadenopathy. The biochemical finding of TLS improved with the management
and tumor burden also showed slight response to the one cycled combination chemotherapy but the patient died of progressive pneumonia.
