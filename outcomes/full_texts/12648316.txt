BACKGROUND: Puerperal sepsis due to group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) toxic shock syndrome is associated with very high morbidity
and mortality. Luckily it is now rare, but diagnosis is not always easy. This report demonstrates the problem of recognizing this disease,
and summarizes the current knowledge on the pathomechanism and management of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. CASE: Two cases of
postpartum streptococcal toxic shock syndrome due to GAS are described. In both cases the correct diagnosis was delayed for several days.
The first patient was sent home with the diagnosis of German measles; the second patient was transferred to our neurological intensive care
unit with the diagnosis of meningitis. Both patients were admitted to the intensive care unit in profound shock, both developed multiple
organ failure, and one patient died. CONCLUSIONS: GAS may produce virulence factors that cause host tissue pathology. Besides aggressive
modern intensive care treatment, early diagnosis and correct choice of anti-streptococcal antibiotics are crucial. A possible adverse effect
of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents requires confirmation in a multicenter study.
