Five cases of Clostridium septicum infection secondary to Escherichia coli O157-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome have been reported. We
report on three cases (one of which is included in the above five) of dual Cl. septicum and E. coil infection; all three patients were
exposed to farm animals. A common zoonotic source for Cl. septicum and E. coli O157 infections should be considered. Patients with hemolytic
uremic syndrome should be treated aggressively and monitored closely for Cl. septicum superinfection.
