Immunoglobulin (Ig) genes were isolated from unamplified conventional as well as polymerase chain reaction-generated cDNA libraries
constructed from the peripheral blood cells of a patient with complete DiGeorge syndrome. Comparison of the sequences of 36 heavy chain
clones to the recently expanded database of human VH genes permitted identification of the germline VH genes that are expressed in this
patient as well as placement of 19 of these genes in a partially resolved 0.8-mb region of the human VH locus. The pattern of VH gene use
does not resemble the fetal (early) repertoire. However, as in the fetal repertoire, there are a number of cDNAs derived from germline genes
that previously have been identified as autoantibodies. Two D mu sequences also were identified, as was another sequence resulting from a
unique recombination event linking JH to an unidentified sequence containing a recombination signal sequence-like heptamer. All of the
DiGeorge cDNAs are closely related to germline VH genes, showing little or no evidence of somatic mutation. In contrast, comparably selected
IgM VH sequences derived from normal adult and age-matched human libraries, and from a second DiGeorge syndrome patient in whom the degree
of thymic dysfunction is much less severe, exhibit considerable evidence of somatic mutation. The absence of somatic mutation is consistent
with the atypical development of functional antibody responses associated with complete DiGeorge syndrome and implicates a role for T cells
in the generation of diversity within the B cell repertoire.
