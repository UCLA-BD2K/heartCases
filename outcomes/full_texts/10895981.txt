Mucormycosis is a rare but invasive opportunistic fungal infection with increased frequency during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The
clinical infections due to Mucor include rhinocerebral, pulmonary, cutaneous, gastrointestinal and disseminated diseases. The first two are
the most common diseases and all entities are associated with a high mortality rate. Still hepatic involvement of Mucor is rarely reported.
We experienced a case of hepatic and small bowel mucormycosis in a 56-year-old woman after induction chemotherapy for B-cell acute
lymphocytic leukemia. Initial symptoms were a high fever unresponsive to broad spectrum antibiotics and pain in the left lower abdominal
quadrant. It was followed by septic shock, deterioration of icterus and progressively elevated transaminase. An abdominal CT demonstrated
multiple hypodense lesions with distinct margins in both lobes of liver and pericolic infiltration at small bowel and ascending colon.
Diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy of the liver. The histopathology of the liver showed hyphae with the right-angle branching, typical of
mucormycosis. The patient was managed with amphotericin B and operative correction of the perforated part of the small bowel was performed.
However, the patient expired due to progressive hepatic failure despite corrective surgery and long-term amphotericin B therapy.
