causing obstructive jaundice and cholangitis is described. There were no predisposing factors. The fungal balls were removed from the common
bile duct and a transduodenal sphincteroplasty was performed. Microscopic analysis yielded colonies of candida. Postoperative period was
uneventful. At follow-up no evidence of candida infection was evident. He is now 3 years post-surgery and is well.
