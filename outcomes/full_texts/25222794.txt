A syndromic, term 2-day-old female neonate presented to the Narayana Multispeciality Hospital, Paediatric outpatient, in August 2013 with
swallowing difficulty and drooling of saliva. Clinical evaluation revealed crepitations at lung bases. Clinical cardiovascular evaluation
and subsequent micro-laryngobronchoscopy was normal. Echocardiography revealed moderate patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), atrial septal defect
(ASD) and right aortic arch (RAA). CT angiography confirmed RAA with aberrant left subclavian, associated with a large Kommerell's
diverticulum (KD) (Fig. 1A, B) Prominent posterior impression of oesophagus was demonstrated on the CT examination (arrow) (Fig. 1C). Three
dimensional (3D) volume rendered CT images illustrated left ductal remnant (Fig. 2A) and large KD causing pressure on the oesophagus (Fig.
2B). Contrast oesophagography confirmed oesophageal impression, swallowing dysfunction and major gastro-oesophageal reflux. In view of
syndromic association and oesophageal dysfunction addition to partial compression, patient was conservatively treated on anti-reflux
management. A. Axial CT image showing right aortic arch(black arrow), kommerell's diverticulum (open arrow) and left ductal
remnant(triangle). (B). Coronal CT image showing right aortic arch (black arrow) and left subclavian artery arising from kommerell's
diverticulum (open arrow). (C). CT sagittal images showing localized oesophageal impression from kommerell's diverticulum (black arrow). A.
Three dimentional volume rendered image viewed from above showing components of vascular ring, completed on left by ductal remnant (open
arrow). (B). Ductal remnant and approximating outpouching from kommerell's diverticulum (green arrow) and main pulmonary artery (MPA) (white
arrow) shown in sagittal surface rendered image (as also shown in A). Authors acknowledge neonatology consultant Dr Ravi Sharma for
providing necessary clinical input and Dr Sejal Shah for providing echocardiography details.
