A patient with past history of esophageal stenosis complained of sudden dysphagia in the erect position which was relieved transiently in
the supine position. Initial esophagoscopy failed to detect any mass in the lumen. Esophagogram revealed shifting foreign body from lower
stenotic site to upper dilated area with postural change from the erect to the supine position. A French bean was detected and removed
during the second esophagoscopy.
