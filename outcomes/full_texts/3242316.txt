Infections associated with marine activities, particularly work or recreation in salt water, present unique diagnostic challenges for the
infectious disease practitioner. Those caused by halophilic, non-cholera Vibrio species are increasingly being recognized in clinical
practice. They typically follow saltwater injuries, especially those associated with coral. Because these infections can be both severe and
life-threatening, a consideration of halophilic Vibrio species in the differential diagnosis of marine-acquired infections is important. In
this case report, we discuss the diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis in a patient with a Caribbean coral injury associated with Vibrio
alginolyticus cellulitis.
