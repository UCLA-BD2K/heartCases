We report two cases that demonstrate not only rare presentations of a rare disease, but accepted methods of hydatid management and the use
of C.A.T. scanning in diagnosis and follow-up. They also confirm the value of operative cholangiography and perhaps introduce the use of a
new anthelminthic agent, mebendazole, in association with surgery.
