We report a case of mixed tumor arising in the lower vaginal wall. The patient was a 20-yr-old nullipararous woman. The tumor was relatively
well-defined with expansile margin, and showed solid sheets or fascicles of stromal-type spindle cells and ovoid epithelial cells with
sparsely scattered nests of mature squamous epithelium and glands lined by mucinous epithelium. Cellular atypia was not conspicuous,
however, mitosis was counted upto 6 per 10 high power fields. We examined this tumor immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally and
reviewed the articles to identify the histogenesis. Positive reaction for vimenin and cytokeratin of stromaltype spindle cells and presence
of desmosome-like structures and tonofilaments on electron microscopic examination suggested the epithelial origin of the stromaltype
spindle cells.
