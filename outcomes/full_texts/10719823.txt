We present an unusual case of vascular sling, tracheal stenosis by complete cartilaginous ring, and aberrant left subclavian artery with
right aortic arch that underwent successful surgical repair for the sling. These abnormalities were suspected from unusual multiple
indentations found on esophagogram. Complete preoperative diagnosis was established with chest computerized tomogram combined with
angiography.
