Biliary complications after orthotopic liver transplants are a continuing cause of morbidity and mortality. Biliary stones and sludge are
less well known complications of hepatic transplantation, although they have long been recognized. Recently we experienced two cases of
biliary stones developed after liver transplantation. One 32-year-old male, who frequently admitted due to recurrent cholangitis, was
treated with percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage and choledochojejunostomy with cholecystectomy. The other 58-year-old male, who had
stones in commone bile duct, was treated by endoscopic manipulation. They are in good condition without recurrent bile duct stones or its
accompanying complications. Although stones and sludge are relatively infrequent after liver transplantation, surgical or interventional
radiologic treatments are usually performed for treatment.
