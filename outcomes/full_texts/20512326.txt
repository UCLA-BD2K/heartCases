A 40-year-old Caucasian man with a known history of haemoglobin E/β-thalassaemia presented to our department with progressive back pain
referred to both limbs, disturbed sensibility and weakness. Due to persisting physical complaints MRI of the thorax was performed (a),
showing a bilateral paravertebral mass. The combination of the mass configuration and a patient with β-thalassaemia gives the presence of
extramedullary haematopoiesis (EMH) a high ranking in the differential diagnosis, but malignant lymphoma could not be excluded.
3′-18F-fluoro-3′-deoxy-L-thymidine (18F-FLT) is used to detect and assess the haematopoietic bone marrow activity and could be helpful for
the diagnosis of EMH . 18F-FLT PET demonstrated bone marrow expansion to the distal parts of the skeleton, with homogeneous activity, and an
elevated standardized uptake value (SUVmax of the spine 4.2; normal 3.7) in bone marrow, but decreased in liver and spleen compared to
normal values . Normally no 18F-FLT activity is shown in the distal bones . More importantly, 18F-FLT PET revealed multiple bilateral and
thoracic paravertebral EMH masses with an elevated SUVmax of 5 (c). For optimal delineation of the EMH mass 18F-FLT PET was fused with MRI
which demonstrated intense 18F-FLT uptake in the paravertebral area of the thorax (b). Due to the observed findings a new bone marrow
aspiration was performed which revealed hypercellularity with erythroid hyperplasia as a result of persistent anaemia. The patient was
treated with blood transfusions and hydroxyurea which provided considerable relief of his complaints. Conflicts of interest None. Open
