Localized in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) has been used to measure the metabolic status of the human brain in a
non-invasive manner; thus, it is often called "a non-invasive biochemical assay". MRS is more sensitive than magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) in detecting ischemic damage by measuring the metabolic changes that occur prior to the anatomic changes. We report a patient who
presented with innominate artery occlusion and symptoms of posterior circulation insufficiency and showed favorable metabolic changes by
(1)H-MRS after revascularization. He showed no visible lesion in brain MRI, but in (1)H-MRS, decreased N-acetylaspartate (NAA) signal was
noted in a resting state. After revascularization, both symptomatic improvement and recovery of NAA signal were observed. (1)H-MRS may
provide valuable clinical information in diagnosis and management of cerebral hypoperfusion at a much earlier stage prior to the anatomic
changes.
