Serum samples from 62 patients with seminoma were assayed for placental alkaline phosphatase-like activity using the monoclonal antibody H17
E2, in order to evaluate its utility as a serum tumour marker. Fifteen of 16 patients (94%) with active seminoma had elevated serum PLAP
levels. Sixteen of 46 (35%) of patients considered to be in remission had elevated PLAP levels (false positive rate 35%). Fifteen false
positive results were considered attributable to concomitant smoking, and if these patients are excluded, only one false positive case was
detected. In 7 out of 7 patients sequential PLAP assays reflected clinical response to treatment.
