Autoimmune cholangitis is a clinical constellation of chronic cholestasis, histological changes of chronic nonsuppurative cholangitis and
the presence of autoantibodies other than antimitochondrial antibody (AMA). It is uncertain whether this entity is definitely different from
AMA positive primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), though it shows some differences. We report a case of autoimmune cholangitis in a 59-year-old
woman, who had been previously diagnosed as AMA-positive PBC associated with rheumatoid arthritis, has been converted to an AMA-negative and
anticentromere antibody-positive PBC during follow-up. The response to ursodeoxycholic acid treatment is poor except within the first few
months, but prednisolone was dropping the biochemical laboratory data.
