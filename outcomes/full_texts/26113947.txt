A 46-years-old patient with a 7 years history of oral and genital recurrent ulceration with ocular redness since one year. He was admitted
for the management of edema of the face and the neck, the onset was progressive without fever or poor general condition. On physical
examination, the patient was aware, he had no fever, heart rate at 80b / min, blood pressure= 14/7, Spo2= 100%. There was no murmur on
auscultation of the cervical vessels, and no neurologic deficit. Computed Tomography angiography was performed and revealed an almost
complete thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein along 9 cm. the patient received curative dose anticoagulant therapy with good
evolution. Beh√ßet's disease is a multisystem disease characterized by a bipolar ulceration, skin lesions, and systemic vasculitis. The
prevalence of vascular disease is about 25% and it alone represents the leading cause of death in this condition. Jugular thrombosis is an
unusual event. Recent data from the literature support the beneficial effect of anticoagulation associated with corticosteroids and
immunosuppressive therapy in its management. A: CT scan angiography in coronal cut showing the right internal jugular vein thrombosis; B:
