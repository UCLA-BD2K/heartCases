A 79-year-old male patient presented with a subacute cauda syndrome caused by an intradural metastasis of the lumbosacral caudate fibres
from an adenocarcinoma of the prostate, which had been treated 5 years earlier with external beam radiation therapy. Diagnosis could not be
established by repeated magnetic resonance images (MRIs) during a 2-year period of increasingly severe radicular pain. Eventually, a small
tumour mass could be visualized on the fourth MRI. Repeated normal serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) did not hint at a prostate cancer
metastasis (range 2.4-5.1 ng ml(-1)); however, PSA in the cerebrospinal fluid was found to be elevated (29.1 ng ml(-1)). Empirical radiation
therapy of the caudate region did not improve radicular pain. Therefore, an exploratory surgical procedure was conducted, which confirmed
the suspicion of an intradural prostate cancer metastasis. In conclusion, PSA in the cerebrospinal fluid provides a useful diagnostic tool
for detecting intradural prostate cancer metastasis.
