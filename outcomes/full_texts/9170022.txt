We reported a 43-year-old woman who showed a Guillain-Barr√© like syndrome associated with acute renal failure (ARF) and thrombocytopenia
following acute viral hepatitis A(HA). The clinical feature was acute progressive and of ascending symmetric paraparesis which developed 5
days after gastrointestinal infection. Neurologic examination showed flaccid paraparesis, areflexia in all extremities and limitation on the
straight leg raising test. Laboratory examinations showed the evidences of ARF, thrombocytopenia and HA. EMG findings suggested a
polyradiculopathy. Renal biopsy showed the findings of acute interstitial nephritis, acute tubular necrosis and IgA deposition nephropathy.
She was treated by plasmapheresis and platelet transfusion, then showed a rapid improvement, and has been well without further complication
after discharge.
