The clinicopathologic features of a Korean patient with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma(ATLL) are presented. A 51-year-old man, who has lived
in Korea since birth, had multiple cutaneous nodules and multiple lymphadenopathy for the previous two months. A histopathologic study of
the lymph node and skin lesion revealed T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of pleomorphic type, medium and large cell type. Peripheral blood
examination showed leukemic features with 30% of abnormal lymphoid cells. HTLV-I proviral DNA pX region was detected in the DNA from
peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) and the specific gag, pol, and env HTLV-I sequences were detected in the lymph node using
polymerase chain reaction technique. Human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma type I(HTLV-I) antibodies were present in the serum. An immunophenotypic
study of the lymph node revealed CD4 positive and CD8 negative helper/inducer T cell type surface markers. This case is the acute type, i.e.
prototypic ATLL. He was treated with an intensive chemotherapy including cyclophosphamide, etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and
prednisone. Despite initial transient improvement, the tumor progressed after three cycles of the regimen and became refractory to further
chemotherapy. These clinicopathologic findings, including the immunophenotypic analysis, established with certainty the diagnosis of HTLV-I-
induced adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.
