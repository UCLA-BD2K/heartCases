The major differential diagnoses of epilepsy associated with small solitary lesion are tuberculous or cysticercus granuloma which are
enhanced in CT and/or MRI study. We report of a 47-year-old man with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy as the presenting feature of a
solitary intrahippocampal calcified mass without enhancement, which turned out to be a Taenia solium cysticercus. There was no apparent
evidence of systemic cysticercosis. Imaging studies revealed a small solitary intrahippocampal calcification without perilesional
enhancement, and atrophy of the hippocampal head portion. Cysticercosis should be considered as an etiology in the differential diagnosis in
lesional medial temporal lobe epilepsy even without perilesional enhancement.
