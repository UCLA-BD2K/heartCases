A 45 year old female presented to the Department of Dentistry and Faciomaxillary Surgery complaining of difficulty in swallowing and tongue
movements. General health examination revealed that the patient was conscious, oriented, a febrile and vitals were stable. Occlusion stable.
Mouth opening was of three finger breadth. Lateral temporomandibular joint movements were satisfactory. On intra oral clinical examination,
a pedunculated mass was observed palatally in relation to left maxillary molar teeth region, where a root stump was evident. Patient stated
that the swelling has started as a pinpoint lesion before 1 year and progressed to the size of 5cm x 3cm as seen during clinical
examination. The colour of the mass was of coral pink, smooth, nodular in some areas and symptomatic during contact between maxillary and
mandibular teeth. Radiological investigations such as orthopantomograph and maxillary occlusal views revealed absence of bony involvement.
To differentiate the clinical mimicking situation of intra oral fibroma and pyogenic granuloma, surgical excision was done followed by
histopathological examination reporting as intra oral fibroma. Fibroma is of smooth surfaced painless solid mass, occasionally nodular, with
collagen and connective tissue histopathologically. Whereas, pyogenic granuloma present as painless and smooth mass which bleeds on
palpation clinically with histopathological picture of chronic inflammatory infiltrate, endothelial cell proliferation and hyperplastic
granulation tissue. Postoperative review was after 1 month with good prognosis thereby facilitating efficient swallowing and tongue
movements. Clinical view of intra oral mass in relation of left maxillary molar region
