Proceedings: NONE NONE A 71-year-old man presented with 6 years of forgetfulness, behavioral change, intrusive “growling” vocalizations,
orthostatic headaches, and a cough. MRI brain was consistent with frontotemporal brain sagging syndrome (figure, A). He subsequently fell,
hitting his chest on a chair, with immediate resolution of his cough, cognitive improvement, and corresponding radiologic desagging (figure,
B; video on the Neurology® Web site at Neurology.org). MRI at presentation (A) shows midbrain descent below the tentorium (black arrows) and
posterior parahippocampal and lingual gyri herniation (white arrows). Follow-up MRI (B) demonstrates restoration of normal brainstem and
medial temporal lobe configuration. Frontotemporal brain sagging syndrome may be caused by intracranial hypotension secondary to CSF leakage
along nerve root sleeves and is a potentially treatable frontotemporal dementia mimic.1 In this case, the fall may have caused a contusion
injury and given him an auto-blood patch. Supplemental data at Neurology.org Author contributions: Catherine F. Slattery: reviewed the
