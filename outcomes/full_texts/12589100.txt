Although cervical epidural abscess is rare, it should be strongly suspected in any patient with unexplainable neck pain and fever,
especially when the patient has a predisposing factor for this infectious process. The authors report a case of cervical epidural abscess in
a 39-yr-old man with an aorto-duodenal fistula, which complicated the interposition of artificial graft for abdominal aortic aneurysm
rupture, which had undertaken 40 months before. Timely detection and intervention rendered him a full neurological recovery. This extremely
rare case is presented with a literature review.
