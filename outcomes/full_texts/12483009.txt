Endobronchial balloon tamponade is an alternative method that can be used to control massive hemoptysis. Several different techniques have
been used for this purpose. We describe a new parallel method, in which biopsy forceps introduced through a bronchoscope channel is used to
grasp a balloon catheter. As the bronchoscope is advanced to the bleeding site, the balloon catheter is pulled into position, and
subsequently inflated. There are several advantages of this technique. It needs no specialized catheter or guide wire, the procedure is
relatively easy to perform, and applicable to other purposes such as introduction of an additional suction catheter.
