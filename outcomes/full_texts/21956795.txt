To the Editor: Lightning limb pain, a clinical feature of tabes dorsalis, is extremely severe and is refractory to various therapeutic
approaches . We report the case of a 61-year-old man who had severe paroxysmal lower limb pain for a decade because of tabes dorsalis. Nine
years ago, he was diagnosed with tabes dorsalis and treated with high-dosage penicillin. The pain attacks were managed with carbamazepine.
At the time of presentation, the patient complained of severe paroxysmal pain that was characterized by a pulling sensation extending from
both legs up to the buttocks and which occurred three or four times daily. He writhed in pain, but apart from his pain attacks, he had no
other complaints. Because an additional 200-mg dose of carbamazepine was ineffective, we added a 400-mg daily dose of gabapentin. The pain
attacks disappeared on the second day after initiating this treatment regime. On the fifth day, he complained of sudden onset of left lower
abdominal pain, i.e., a pulling sensation that extended upward from the anus and lasted for 2 h. A visceral crisis involving tabes dorsalis
was suspected; therefore, we increased the gabapentin dosage to 600 mg daily, which reduced his abdominal pain the next day. On the 14th
day, the patient experienced complete relief from pain with an 800-mg dose of gabapentin. Pain did not recur after carbamazepine was
discontinued because of the toxic eruption on the 25th day. At the 1-year follow-up examination, he did not report recurring pain and
complained only of slight dysesthesia in his right leg. The pathophysiology of tabes dorsalis involves leptomeningeal inflammation and
atrophy of the posterior columns of the spinal cord and posterior nerve roots . In most patients, pain often persists after antibiotic
treatment [2, 3] and should be treated as neuropathic rather than inflammatory pain. Very few studies have been performed on tabetic pain
treatment, and there are only several case reports on pain modulation by carbamazepine or sodium valproate [4, 5]. Our findings suggest that
an alternative therapeutic regime involving gabapentin can effectively treat tabetic lightning pain. This article is distributed under the
