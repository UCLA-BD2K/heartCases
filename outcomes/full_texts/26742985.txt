A 61-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with vomiting and progressively worsening abdominal pain. A computed tomography (CT)
was performed. The diagnosis of patient was acute cholecystitis and the patient was referred to general surgery clinic. In addition CT scan
showed bilateral ectopic kidneys with urinary bladder herniation (Figures 1 and 2). Both kidneys were fused at the medial borders of each
pole. To our knowledge, the case of pancake kidney with bladder herniation was not published yet in the literature. Pancake kidney is very
rare type of congenital fusion anomaly of the kidney. It is described as a renal mass located in the pelvis which is formed by complete
medial fusion of renal parenchyma without intervening septum (1). Each kidney has its own collecting system and anteriorly placed short
ureters entering the bladder orthotopically (1). The presence of a pancake kidney may predispose the formation of stones due to the probable
rotation anomaly of the collecting system and short ureters which are prone to stasis and obstruction. Patients with pancake kidney are
usually asymptomatic, but may present with features of urinary tract infection, fever and vague lower abdominal pain (1). If a pancake
kidney has to undergo surgery, division of the parenchyma presents potential problems such as renal vascular damage, postoperative renal
failure and eventual renal failure (2). Asymptomatic cases can be managed conservatively with long-term follow-up of renal function (1). If
there are symptoms of renal failure, surgery is warranted. Ultrasonography, excretory urography and CT were efficient in detection and
evaluation of pancake kidney anomaly (1).
