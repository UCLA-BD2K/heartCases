A case of intramural sparganosis of jejunum presenting as intestinal obstruction is described. Resected intestine from a 48 year old man
with acute abdomen revealed a degenerated sparganum in the submucosa with typical tissue reaction and extensive edema. The tissue reaction
was basically granulomatous, consisting of layers of inner palisading histiocytes and outer mononuclear cell infiltration. Many
calcospherules were prominent within the degenerated worm. Eosinophil infiltration was scanty.
