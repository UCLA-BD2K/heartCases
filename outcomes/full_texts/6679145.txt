Chest X-ray findings were studied in 618 pediatric patients with M. pneumoniae respiratory infections. Of these, 472 (76 percent) had
pneumonia. Pneumonia was most frequently observed in the lower lung field and least frequently in the upper lung field. The enlargement of
hilar lymph nodes was observed in 34 percent of patients with M. pneumoniae pneumonia in contrast to 5 to 9 percent of patients with
pneumonia due to other agents, suggesting that it was rather characteristic of M. pneumoniae pneumonia. It was observed in no patients below
one year of age, in 41 percent of those aged one to five years, and then decreased with increase in age. Of children with M. pneumoniae
respiratory infections, fever, pneumonia, and positive CF test were less frequently observed in infants below one year, showing that they
have slighter symptoms; positive IHA test was less frequently observed and isolation of M. pneumoniae was more frequently observed, as
compared to other age groups, among whom these findings were similar. It must be kept in mind, however, that fatal cases of M. pneumoniae
pneumonia in infants were reported.
