Jugular foramen neurilemmoma is frequently manifested as a jugular foramen syndrome or extraaxial mass. Neurilemmoma arising from the
cranial nerves of the foramen, although rare, may be manifestated as an intracranial or extracranial mass lesion. When the tumor is located
only in the intracranium, it is often misdiagnosed as an acoustic neurinoma or a brainstem tumor because of their similarity in clinical or
radiological findings. We present a rare case of jugular foramen neurilemmoma with only intracranial extension with clinical and radiologic
features of an intra-axial brainstem tumor.
