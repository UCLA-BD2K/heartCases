Technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) uptake is known to be increased in breast cancer because of increased blood flow from
angiogenesis and heightened metabolism. We performed a 99mTc-MIBI scan in a patient with mammary Paget's disease. The patient had underlying
invasive cancer in the same side of the breast. 99mTc-MIBI scan exhibited a scintigraphic image of the uptake from the invasive cancer
lesion located deeply in the breast toward the epidermis. 99mTc-MIBI showed an uptake in the deeply located invasive cancer lesion as well
as nipple lesion. Especially, the delayed phase of Tc-MIBI scan demonstrated the tumor site more accurately. In conclusion, 99mTc-MIBI scan
could be a useful adjunct to clinical decision making in the management of Paget's disease of the breast.
