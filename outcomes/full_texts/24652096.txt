Potential Conflict of Interest No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported. A 71-year-old man who underwent
cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) implantation five years ago, was admitted by a lengthy febrile illness. An
initial transthoracic echocardiogram identified a unique vegetation of 10 mm adhered to device cables. Triple antibiotic was started with
initial favorable clinical response, but the control transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) at ten days showed several large mobile
vegetations adhered to CRT-D leads and partially occupying the tricuspid annulus (A-B). Three-dimensional TEE confirmed these findings (C).
Accordingly, emergent cardiac surgery for device removal was indicated (D). The patient died within 48 hours because of septic multiple
organ dysfunction syndrome. Two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiogram showing several large mobile vegetations adhered to device leads
and partially occupying the tricuspid annulus. Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiogram confirmed the spatial orientation of the
giant mass. Author contributions Conception and design of the research, Acquisition of data and Critical revision of the manuscript for
