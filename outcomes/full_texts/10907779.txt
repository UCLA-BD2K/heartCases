BACKGROUND: Intra-abdominal desmoplastic small round cell tumor is a rare malignancy with a predilection for young males. Unique
histological and immunocytochemical features distinguish the tumor from other members of the family of small round cell tumors of infancy
and childhood. The aggressive nature of tumor spread, relative insensitivity to chemotherapy, and generally incomplete resectability result
in a very poor prognosis. The authors report a case of a 39-year-old man with diffuse abdominal and pelvic involvement of intra-abdominal
desmoplastic small round cell tumor treated with aggressive chemotherapy and surgery. METHODS: Computed-tomography (CT)-guided biopsy of an
omental mass was performed. Histologically, discrete nests of uniform closely packed malignant cells were distributed in a background of
focally desmoplastic stroma. Immunocchemistry demonstrated positivity for epithelial, mesenchymal, and neural markers. On the basis of these
unique histological and immunohistochemical characteristics, the diagnosis of desmoplastic small round cell tumor was made. The patient was
treated with aggressive neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of a high-dose alkylator -based combination regimen, followed by surgery.
RESULTS: The patient had a 10 to 15 percent regression in tumor mass in response to chemotherapy. Laparotomy revealed two large omental
masses, another large mass adherent to the left colon and pelvic sidewall, and diaphragmatic, peritoneal and mesenteric studding with small
nodules. Complete surgical resection was not possible. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-abdominal desmoplastic small round cell tumor remains an
aggressive malignancy with an extremely poor prognosis. Although some response to chemotherapy may be possible, complete resection is rare,
and surgical efforts are general palliative.
