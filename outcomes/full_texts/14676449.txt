Anaphylaxis following laminaria insertion rarely occurs but may be a life-threatening condition. Laminaria tents, prepared from natural sea
kelp, are commonly used prior to elective termination of pregnancy to achieve cervical dilatation. We report herein two cases of anaphylaxis
caused by IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to laminaria. Two women, each of whom had undergone at least one previous abortion where a laminaria
had been utilized, developed anaphylactic reaction following laminaria insertion. The reaction included urticaria, nausea, breathing
difficulty, and hypotension. The patients subsequently underwent skin testing and measurement of serum specific IgE level to laminaria
extract, and were shown to elicit positive responses to laminaria. The implication and impact of laminaria allergy on gynecologic procedures
are significant and this allergy should be included in the list of differential diagnoses for hypersensitive reaction in gynecologic
procedures.
