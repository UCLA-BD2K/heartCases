Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is one of the most commonly encountered serious infectious disease entities in gynecology. The past decade
has witnessed many advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of PID. It is now evident that such pelvic infections are largely
polymicrobial in origin, with major involvement by anaerobic organisms. Salpingo-oophoritis is a part of the spectrum of PID. Included among
this group of infections are tubo-ovarian abscesses, traditionally referred to as either gonococcal or non-gonococcal in origin. Within the
latter group of infections the importance of anaerobic organisms has also been elucidated. Of particular interest is the reported
observation of an increased frequency of salpingo-oophoritis among users of intrauterine devices (IUDs). These reports have noted the
specific occurrence of serious pelvic infections due to Actinomyces species, and this will be the topic of the infectious disease
conference. Our patient presented with a chronic illness characterized by lethargy, back pain, fever, and anemia; subsequently evaluation
disclosed the presence of a large pelvic mass which was confirmed as a tubo-ovarian abscess at surgery. Histological evaluation demonstrated
involvement by Actinomyces species. This patient's illness is discussed as a complication of chronic IUD usage with reference to specific
management for this emerging problem.
