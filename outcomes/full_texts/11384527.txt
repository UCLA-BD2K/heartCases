Two large outbreaks of diarrheal illness associated with Cyclospora cayetanensis, a coccidian parasite, provided an opportunity to evaluate
clinical syndromes associated with this enteric pathogen. Reiter syndrome, a triad of ocular inflammation, inflammatory oligoarthritis, and
sterile urethritis, has been associated with enteric infections. We describe the first case of Reiter syndrome following protracted symptoms
of Cyclospora infection.
