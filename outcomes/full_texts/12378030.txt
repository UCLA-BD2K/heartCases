Asynchronous bilateral torsion of the spermatic cord in the newborn is extremely rare. We report such a case in a 4-day-old boy with
subsequent operative discovery of prior in utero torsion of the contralateral spermatic cord. The diagnosis was made by physical
examination, transillumination test, color Doppler ultrasound, and confirmed by emergent surgical exploration. To our knowledge, the present
case is the 6th case of asynchronous bilateral torsion of the spermatic cord in the English literature, and the first case in Korea.
