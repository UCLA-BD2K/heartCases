Myiasis is a parasitic infestation caused by larvae of several fly species. Diagnosis and treatment are simple. This infestation is,
however, rarely seen in the vulvar area. We present a short review of the disease and the case of a 19-year-old pregnant girl with vulvar
myiasis and concomitant syphilis, vaginal trichomoniasis and genital candidiasis. The patient was also positive for human immunodeficiency
virus.
