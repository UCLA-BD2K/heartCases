Jarcho-Levin syndrome (JLS) is a condition manifested by malformations of vertebral bodes and related ribs. There are two major subtypes
spondylocostal dysostosis and spondylothoracic dysostosis, with different survival rates, associated malformations, and inheritance
patterns. We have experienced an autopsy case of a premature female fetus with multiple congenital anomalies. She was 30 weeks of
gestational age, born as the second baby of twins and expired shortly after birth. A post-mortem examination revealed multiple abnormalities
including cervicothoracic hemivertebrae, a diminished number of right-sided ribs, and pulmonary hypoplasia with left diaphragmatic hernia.
In addition, there were anomalous rotation of the foregut, unfused pancreas and anomalous drainage of the superior vena cava. Chromosomal
analysis showed 46, XX, del(4)(q ter).
