Insertion of methyl methacrylate polymer into newly reamed bony cavities has sometimes resulted in profound hypotension, cardiac arrest, or
sudden death which are more common in patients with hemodynamic instability or hypovolemia. In paralysis agitans(Parkinson's disease),
dramatic worsening of the disease often occurs when another illness or trauma accompanies it. And it is possible that chronic medication
with levodopa can cause the loss of ability to support blood pressure. So, it involves some risk to use methyl methacrylate in chronic
levodopa-treated paralysis agitans. We present a case of paralysis agitans who demonstrated profound hypotension immediately following
insertion of methyl methacrylate polymer in spite of normovolemia and proper anesthetic management.
