and, when it appears, it is usually part of a MEA1 syndrome. We present a case of nesidioblastosis in a young woman, with no concurrent
endocrine pathology, while we discuss in detail the diagnostic and therapeutic problems posed by this condition. The selected treatment was
sub-total pancreatectomy (70–80%) and the histopathologic and immunohistochemical tests of the surgical specimen showed: “Diffuse
Nesidioblastosis”. The histopathologic and immuno-histochemical features of the resected pancreas are analysed in detail.
