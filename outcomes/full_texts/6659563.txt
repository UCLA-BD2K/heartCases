A patient required mitral valve replacement following ineffective antibiotic treatment of enterococcal endocarditis caused by Streptococcus
faecium. Endocarditis had relapsed despite therapy with ampicillin and tobramycin for six weeks. A second relapse had occurred following
treatment with penicillin and gentamicin. Initial failure of antibiotic therapy may be related to the known lack of in vitro and in vivo
synergy between penicillin and tobramycin against S. faecium. Effective therapy of enterococcal endocarditis requires considerations of
bacterial speciation, determination of high-level aminoglycoside resistance, and preferably adequate antibiotic synergy studies to assure
effective therapy.
