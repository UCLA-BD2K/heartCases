Inherited susceptibility to ovarian cancer has been associated with germline defects at several loci. The major known ovarian cancer
susceptibility gene is BRCA1 on chromosome 17q, which confers a risk of approximately 60% by the age of 70 years. Truncating mutations in
BRCA2 on chromosome 13q also predispose to ovarian cancer, although they confer a lower risk than mutations in BRCA1. We have studied the
molecular basis of ovarian cancer predisposition in a Finnish family with three affected sisters. Analysis of polymorphic markers provided
evidence against linkage to BRCA1, but the sibship was consistent with linkage to BRCA2. Conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis was used
to screen the entire coding sequence of BRCA2. A G to A transition at nucleotide 8702 was observed, which is predicted to convert glycine
2901 to aspartate in the encoded protein. This sequence variant was not detected in 220 cancer-free Finnish control individuals, or in
several hundred cancer families of many nationalities previously screened for BRCA2 mutations. Taken together with the fact that this amino
acid residue and the surrounding region of BRCA2 is identical in mouse and chicken, the data suggest that this alteration is a disease-
causing BRCA2 missense mutation. Previously published data indicate that the risks of breast and ovarian cancer conferred by
BRCA2-truncating mutations varies with the position of the mutation in the gene. The missense mutation reported here suggests that the BRCA2
domain including and surrounding glycine 2901 may be more important in preventing neoplastic transformation in ovarian epithelium than in
breast epithelium.
