A case of difficult intubation is described in which the problem was overcome by use of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA). The patient had
difficulty in mouth opening due to severe burn scar contracture around the mouth and limited access prevented tracheal intubation. The use
of LMA is shown to have obviated the need for tracheal intubation in the case of a patient whose injuries would have made this technique
difficult.
