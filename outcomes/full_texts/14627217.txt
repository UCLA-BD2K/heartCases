group B streptococcal endocarditis in the setting of obstetric and gynecologic practice reported since the last review in 1985. Case:
Abortion remains a common antecedent event, but in contrast to earlier reports, most patients did not have underlying valvular disease, the
tricuspid valve was most often involved, and mortality was low. Patients with tricuspid valve infection tended to have a subacute course,
whereas those with aortic or mitral involvement typically had a more acute, fulminant course. Conclusion: Despite an improvement in
mortality, morbidity remains high, with 8 of 11 patients having clinically significant emboli.
