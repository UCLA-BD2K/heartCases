We report a second case of laboratory-confirmed infection caused by Rickettsia mongolotimonae in Marseille, France. This rickettsiosis may
represent a new clinical entity; moreover, its geographic distribution may be broader than previously documented. This pathogen should be
systematically considered in the differential diagnosis of atypical rickettsioses, especially rashless fevers with lymphangitis and
lymphadenopathy, in southern France and perhaps elsewhere.
