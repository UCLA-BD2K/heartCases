We report a case of hepatic cavernous hemangioma with computed tomographic findings of well demarcated nodular lesser attenuation foci
within the main low attenuation mass on precontrast scans and non-enhancement of the foci even on the delayed contrast scans. These have
been described as one of the atypical findings of cavernous hemangioma earlier in the literature. Surgery proved that sclerosis accounted
for the hypodense nodular densities within the hepatic cavernous hemangioma.
