The patient was symptomatic and was treated by injecting absolute ethanol into the largest cyst every week, but the secretion from the cyst
persisted. The patient was then treated by absolute ethanol injection every day with good results. CA 19-9 was measured in the cystic fluid.
The secretion was related to CA 19-9 activity. Thus, for patients with symptoms from a liver cyst, the injection of ethanol every day can be
effective. CA19-9 level in the contents of the liver cyst was an important factor in assessing the effect of ethanol injection on the liver
cyst.
