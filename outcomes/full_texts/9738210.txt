During 1992 and 1993 the Wisconsin Division of Health investigated five cases in which copper-contaminated drinking water was suspected of
causing gastrointestinal upsets. Each of these case studies was conducted after our office was notified of high copper levels in drinking
water or notified of unexplained illnesses. Our findings suggest that drinking water that contains copper at levels above the federal action
limit of 1.3 mg/l may be a relatively common cause of diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and nausea. These symptoms occurred most frequently in
infants and young children and among resident of newly constructed or renovated homes.
