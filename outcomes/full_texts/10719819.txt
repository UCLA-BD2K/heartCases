Refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) is an extremely rare type of myelodysplastic syndrome in children. We describe a 10-year-
old boy with RARS presented with pancytopenia. He remained relatively stable with only a few transfusions until age of 20 years, when he
underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) because of increased transfusion requirements. He remains in complete chimeric
state at 20 months posttransplant with normal hematologic parameters. To our knowledge, this is the first description of successful BMT in a
patient with childhood-onset RARS. The indication of BMT for this rare disorder in children is discussed.
