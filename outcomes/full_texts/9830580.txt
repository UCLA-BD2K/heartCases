commonly seen after traumatic splenic rupture and splenectomy. Post-traumatic splenosis is often considered a rare entity, but is probably
underreported because of its asymptomatic nature. We describe the first reported case of splenosis presenting as a liver mass,
indistinguishable from a liver tumor by standard preoperative evaluation. The pathophysiology, evaluation and management of splenosis is
discussed as well as the decision to resect a benign appearing liver mass.
