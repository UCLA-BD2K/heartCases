We present a case of a patient with rare anatomy of a maxillary second molar with three mesiobuccal root canals and a maxillary third molar
with four separate roots, identified using multi-slice computed topography (CT) and three-dimensional reconstruction techniques. The
described case enriched/might enrich our knowledge about possible anatomical aberrations of maxillary molars. In addition, we demonstrate
the role of multi-slice CT as an objective tool for confirmatory diagnosis and successful endodontic management.
