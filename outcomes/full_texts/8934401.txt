The application of pelviscopic surgery for the management of ovarian tumors has increased dramatically in the last few years. Of particular
concern is the pelviscopic excision of malignant ovarian tumors. One of the important potential problems with this approach is disseminating
malignant cells to peritoneal surface. The aim of this report is to draw attention to the possibility of the occurrence of a tumor
implantation at the pelviscopic port site in patients with malignant ovarian tumors. A case is presented here in which a localized tumor
implant occurred in the abdominal trocar site after pelviscopic removal of ovarian mass subsequently found to be squamous cell carcinoma
arising in mature cystic teratoma with brief review of literatures.
