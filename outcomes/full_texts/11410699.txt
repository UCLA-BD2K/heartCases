A rare manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), in which early diagnosis and
aggressive therapy are of prime importance for favorable outcome. The pathogenesis of CVST is largely unknown, but it is thought to be
caused by cerebral vasculitis, antiphospholipid antibodies or other conditions associated with enhanced coagulability. We describe two cases
of SLE with CVST which were not associated with antiphospholipid antibodies. Both cases were treated with immunosuppressants (intravenous
methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide pulse therapy) and anticoagulant drugs (heparin and subsequent maintenance therapy with warfarin).
There was a marked improvement of neurologic symptoms with the disappearance of thrombus in a follow-up MRI. The possibility of CVST should
be considered in any patients with SLE who show neuropsychiatric manifestations.
