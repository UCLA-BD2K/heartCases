Streptomyces species are rare causes of invasive infection in humans. We report the first documented case of a catheter-associated
bacteremia due to Streptomyces. The most likely source of infection was unlicensed, injectable holistic preparations that the patient had
received. We review reported cases of invasive infections caused by Streptomyces and comment on the potential infectious complications of
parenteral holistic treatments.
