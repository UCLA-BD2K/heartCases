A 47-year-old woman with a 33-year history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) visited our outpatient clinic complaining of numbness in her hands
and progressive weakness in all four extremities. She had urinary incontinence for 1 month. On physical examination, she had joint
deformities due to RA in all four extremities. The deep tendon reflexes were hyperactive and she was quadriparetic. Cervical spine magnetic
resonance imaging revealed periodontoid pannus formation that had destroyed the C1 and C2 vertebrae bodies and compressed the medulla
oblongata (Fig. 1). We administered three infusions of 1,000 mg of methylprednisolone intravenously to relieve her symptoms. However, the
response to the steroid pulses was poor. A neurosurgeon recommended surgery, but the patient refused. Antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF)
therapy was contraindicated because the patient had active pulmonary and urinary infections. At follow-up, her neurological symptoms were
unchanged. Typically, RA affects synovial joints. Spinal involvement generally presents in the cervical spine. Myelomalacia can develop with
compression of the cervical spinal cord by periodontoid pannus. Recently, the treatment of RA has become more effective and the development
of periodontoid pannus has become very rare. When patients with RA present with difficulty walking, progressive weakness of all four
extremities, spasticity, and neurogenic bladder symptoms, the clinician should consider periodontoid pannus compression. The literature
includes cases of periodontoid pannus treated successfully with surgery. In addition, two cases were treated successfully with infliximab.
Therefore, anti-TNF therapy in the early stages of rheumatoid myelopathy might obviate the need for surgery. No potential conflict of
interest relevant to this article is reported. A T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the sagittal cervical spine shows compression of
the medulla oblongata by periodontoid pannus (shown by the arrow).
