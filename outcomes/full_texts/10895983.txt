Peritoneal pregnancies are classified as primary and secondary. Primary implantation on the peritoneum is extremely rare in extrauterine
pregnancy and is a potentially life-threatening variation of ectopic pregnancy within the peritoneal cavity, representing a grave risk to
maternal health. Secondary abdominal pregnancies are by far the most common and result from tubal abortion or rupture, or less often, after
uterine rupture with subsequent implantation within abdomen. Early diagnosis and appropriate surgical management, regardless of stage of
gestation, appear to be important in achieving good results. We report a case of primary peritoneal pregnancy in a 28-year-old woman, who
had severe lower abdominal pain one day before laparotomy for a preoperative diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. The conceptus was implanted on
the left uterosacral ligament. A fresh embryo of approximately 8 weeks' gestation was found in the conceptus.
