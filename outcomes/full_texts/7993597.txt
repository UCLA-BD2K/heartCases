Primary hyperparathyroidism is a rare disease in children and is characterized by conspicuous skeletal and renal changes. A 12 year old male
patient presented with symptoms of polydipsia, polyuria, general weakness, nausea, and vomiting which had begun 3 months earlier, and showed
typical laboratory findings of primary hyperparathyroidism. Confirmatory diagnosis was made by elevated parathyroid hormone concentration in
serum, technetium-thallium subtraction scan imaging method and histopathologic finding of chief cell hyperplasia. The laboratory findings
revealed elevated levels of BUN, creatinine and decreased GFR. Kidney biopsy showed typical calcium deposits in tubules with marked
tubulointerstitial infiltration. After subtotal parathyroidectomy, clinical findings improved remarkably.
