Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome (HSS) is a heredodegenerative disorder characterized by both progressive pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs,
dysarthric speech, and mental deterioration. No diagnostic biochemical test is yet available, and diagnosis of HSS can be confirmed only at
autopsy by the characteristic neuropathology including abnormal iron storage, disordered myelination, and loss of brain substance. We
present two siblings with clinical features consistent with HSS, in whom magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated the deposition of
iron in the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra thus allowing an antemortem diagnosis of HSS.
