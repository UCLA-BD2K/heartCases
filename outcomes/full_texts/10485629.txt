Clinically evident metastases of carcinomas to the thyroid gland are rare, particularly from a colorectal primary tumor. We present a case
of colonic adenocarcinoma metastatic to the thyroid gland with histopathologic and immunohistochemical findings. A 68-year-old woman with a
history of Dukes' stage B colon carcinoma presented a mass in the thyroid gland. The tumor was confirmed to be metastatic adenocarcinoma
from the colon. The immunohistochemical findings demonstrated positive staining for cytokeratin 20, low-molecular-weight cytokeratin, villin
and carcinoembryonic antigen, but stains were negative for cytokeratin 7 and thyroglobulin.
