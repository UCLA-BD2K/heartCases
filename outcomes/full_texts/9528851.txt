Indocyanine green (ICG) is clinically approved for the determination of liver function, cardiac output and plasma volume. In this pilot
study, ICG was used as photosensitizer in combination with a diode laser to treat AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in three patients.
Directly and up to 50 min after intravenous administration of ICG (2-4 mg kg(-1) body weight), KS (n=57), mainly plaque-type, were
irradiated using a diode laser (lambda em=805 nm, 100 J cm, 0.5-5 W cm) matching the absorption maximum. Complete remission of KS (n=16) was
achieved when irradiated 1-30 min after injection of the second dose of ICG (2 x 2 mg kg(-1) b.w., 30 min apart) with 3-5 W cm(-2) and 100 J
cm(-2). Biopsies (n=3) revealed necrosis of the tumour 24 h and complete remission 4 weeks after therapy. In general, systemic side-effects
were not observed and cosmetic results were very good. However, hyperpigmentation occurred temporarily in lesions located on the lower
extremities. These findings show that AIDS-associated KS can be effectively treated after photosensitization with ICG and subsequent
irradiation with an appropriate diode laser. However, additional investigations need to elucidate the exact mechanism of action of ICG-
mediated phototherapy and have to show the efficacy for the treatment of other highly vascularized solid tumours.
