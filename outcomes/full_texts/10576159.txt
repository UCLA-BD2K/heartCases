Parosteal osteosarcoma is a low-grade osteosarcoma, which occurs on the surface of the bone. We had experienced a parosteal osteosarcoma
involving the flat bone, the scapula of a 21-year-old man. This is an extremely rare location for a parosteal osteosarcoma. Plain radiograph
showed broad-based, well-defined radiodense lesion at the scapula. Computed tomogram demonstrated an intact cortex and absence of a
medullary involvement. Tumor showed a lobulated, high-density lesion, indicating bone formation. Histologically, parosteal osteosarcoma is a
well-differentiated osteosarcoma. The tumor is composed of a hypocellular proliferation of spindle cells, with minimal cytologic atypia. The
bone is in the form of a well-formed bony trabeculae. Occasional cartilage is present in the form of a cap.
