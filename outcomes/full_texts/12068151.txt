Metastatic carcinomas are the largest group of malignant tumors of the liver. But parenchymal liver metastasis from cystic ovarian
adenocarcinoma is very rare. We report a case in which the resection of metastatic liver neoplasm from ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma was
done 7 yr after initial treatment. A 48-yr-old oriental housewife complained of easy fatigability and right lower quadrant discomfort. The
hepatic mass was detected by ultrasonographic examination. Serum albumin, bilirubin, and aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase
were normal. Alkaline phosphatase level was slightly increased at 146 IU/L. A tumor marker study showed alpha-fetoprotein 0.97 IU/mL,
carcinoembryonic antigen 0.965 ng/mL, cancer antigen 125 1,267 ng/mL and CA 19-9 106.1 ng/mL. The operation involved cholecystectomy and
segmentectomy VI and VII of the liver. The patient recovered from the surgery without any complication. On the 10th postoperative day, the
patient received a single-regimen chemotherapy with paclitaxel (Taxol, 155 mg/m(2) BSA) and was discharged. She has been carefully followed-
up without any evidence of recurrence after completion of the remaining 5 cycles of chemo-therapy, at intervals of three weeks.
