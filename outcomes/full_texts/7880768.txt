with extended intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) for pancreatic cancer. This approach has provided a dramatic improvement in long-term
survival and control of local recurrence. Hepatic metastases, however, remain an unsolved problem. Among patients with this combined
therapy, we found hepatic metastases in 8 of 22 patients postoperatively. Four of these 8 were considered candidates for further therapy and
underwent treatment for their hepatic metastases, the other 4 had too extensive disease. Two patients with multiple hepatic metastases
underwent percutaneous ethanol injection therapy and chemotherapy, but they died within a year. Two patients with a solitary hepatic
metastases underwent hepatic resection. One patient died two years and six months after the first operation because of multiple metastases
in the liver and both lungs, while the other patient is still alive over six years after the first operation with an excellent performance
status. When a patient has no local recurrence and a solitary metastasis in the liver, surgical resection of the liver metastasis should be
performed.
