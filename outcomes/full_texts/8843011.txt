We report a case of sebaceous glands in the esophagus diagnosed by endoscopic biopsy. The patient was a 47-year-old Korean man presented
with postprandial pain of several months duration. An endoscopic examination disclosed an early gastric carcinoma in the gastric antrum and
a 0.4 x 0.4 cm sized irregular lobulated nodule in the middle esophagus. Microscopically, the lobule was proven to be sebaceous glands in
the submucosa. Possible histogenesis of this lesion is discussed.
