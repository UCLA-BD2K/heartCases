Atretic encephaloceles or myelomeningoceles are frequently solid due to hamartomatous proliferation of fibrous tissue and blood vessels.
Because of the fibrous nature of the tumor with no cystic cavity and unusual location with no connection to CNS, they are frequently
regarded as insignificant hamartomas. Apart from this terminology, they are also described as cutaneous meningiomas or hamartomas with
ectopic meningothelial elements by the presence of meningothelial cells. We report a case of atretic encephalocele in the parietal scalp of
an 8 year-old boy and a case of myelomeningocele in the posterior mediastinum of a 31 year-old woman. The terms atretic encephalocele and
myelomeningocele are more appropriate for these cases because they include their pathogenesis and the non-neoplastic nature of the lesion.
