The aim of our study was to describe the radiologic findings of extensive acute lung injury associated with limited thoracic irradiation.
Limited thoracic irradiation occasionally results in acute lung injury. In this condition, chest radiograph shows diffuse ground-glass
appearance in both lungs and thin-section CT scans show diffuse bilateral ground-glass attenuation with traction bronchiectasis,
interlobular septal thickening and intralobular smooth linear opacities.
