We describe a 51-yr-old man presenting with syncope due to torsade de pointes. The torsade de pointes was refractory to conventional medical
therapy, including infusion of isoproterenol, MgSO4, potassium, lidocaine, and amiodarone. His past history, physical findings, and hormone
study confirmed that QT prolongation was caused by anterior hypopituitarism that developed as a sequela of hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome. The long QT interval with deep inverted T wave was completely normalized 4 weeks after starting steroid and thyroid hormone
replacement. Hormonal disorders should be considered as a cause of torsade de pointes, because this life-threatening arrhythmia can be
treated by replacing the missing hormone.
