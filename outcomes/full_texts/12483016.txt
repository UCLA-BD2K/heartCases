Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a rare systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology characterized by an evanescent rash,
intermittent spiking high fever, arthralgia, and a variety of systemic features. We describe a 46-yr-old woman with Still s disease who
presented with a 2-month history of a symmetrical vesiculopustular eruptions only on both hands and feet. Skin biopsy specimens of both
vesicle and pustule revealed fibrin thrombi deposition in the small dermal vessels with little inflammation, subepidermal bulla, and
ischemic necrosis of the overlying epidermis, which were consistent with a vasculopathic reaction. Her skin lesions gradually disappeared in
response to conventional AOSD therapy, as elevated serum ferritin levels, an index of disease activity, decreased. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first case of vesiculopustular lesions as a skin manifestation of AOSD.
