Most of malignant tumors arising in ovarian and extraovarian endometriosis are carcinomas. Mixed mullerian tumor and endometrial stromal
sarcoma arising in intestinal endometriosis are rarely described, but its clinicopathologic features have not been well characterized. Here
we report a case of endometrial stromal sarcoma of the sigmoid colon arising in endometriosis with a review of six additional cases of
endometrial stromal sarcoma arising in intestinal endometriosis found in English literatures. The patients ranged in age from 36 to 64 yr.
Presenting symptoms were pain, bloody diarrhea, and tenesmus. Some patients had a previous history of endometriosis. Most of the tumors
arose in the rectosigmoid colon. The histologic features were the same as their uterine counterpart. No death of disease had been reported.
This rare tumor should not be confused with gastrointestinal stromal tumor clinically and histologically.
