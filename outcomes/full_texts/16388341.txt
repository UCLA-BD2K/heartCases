A healthy 22–year–old man complained of primary stabbing headache (PSH) for about two months. The headache recurred after one year and after
a month the pain took on the characteristics of short–lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing
(SUNCT). This patient shows some unusual features: juvenile onset, miosis during attacks as part of autonomic phenomena and close temporal
relationship with stressful events. The association between PSH and SUNCT may be interpreted as the coexistence of two different headaches
or that the PSH is a forerunner to the SUNCT.
