Inclusion body myositis is a rare myopathy that clinically resembles a chronic polymyositis and histopathologically is characterized by the
presence of rimmed vacuoles containing ultrastructural cytoplasmic degradation products with filamentous intranuclear and cytoplasmic
inclusions. Since clinical features are not uniform, histopathologic and ultrastructural studies are necessary to confirm the diagnosis. We
report a typical case of inclusion body myositis with histopathologic and ultrastructural study. The patient was a 31 year old male who
presented with progressive weakness of both forearms, hands and lower extremities for 10 years.
