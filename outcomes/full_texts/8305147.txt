Actinomycosis is a chronic suppurative and granulomatous disease characterized histologically by sulfur granules with extensive necrosis,
fibrosis and sinus formation. Depending on the site of primary infection, actinomycosis is generally classified as cervicofacial, thoracic
and abdominal type. The liver is known to be the primary site of infection in 15% with abdominal actinomycosis. The authors have experienced
a case of liver abscess in a 24-year-old male. The sono-guided aspiration biopsy revealed findings of infiltration of neutrophils and
characteristics sulfur granules by light microscopy. This case was thought to represent an instance of liver actinomycosis. Although there
have been a lot of reports on actinomycosis of the liver in other countries, only 3 cases were reported in Korea.
