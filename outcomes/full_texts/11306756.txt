Hemangioendothelioma is borderline or intermediate type of vascular neoplasm. Hemangioendothelioma is rare lesion that constitutes less than
0.5% of the malignant tumors of bone. We present a case of low-grade hemagioendothelioma of the skull in a 29-yr-old woman. She had pain,
diplopia and exophthalmos of the left eye. Radiographic images showed a relatively well-demarcated, expansile osteolytic lesion with
irregularly thickened trabeculae and calcifications in the left greater wing of sphenoid bone. Histologically, the tumor was an infiltrative
vasoformative lesion. The vessels are generally well-formed with open or compressed lumina surrounded by endothelial cells showing mild
atypia. It lacked frequent mitotic figures and severe atypia. Although excessive bleeding occurred during the operation, the mass was
totally resected. Postoperative radiation was not necessary. She is free of disease and well 6 months postoperatively.
