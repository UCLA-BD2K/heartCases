bile duct during cholecystectomy. Subsequent access to the biliary tree was obtained by using a long heavy gauge needle after first
opacifying the system with contrast injection through a nasobiliary tube. It is now twenty six months after initial percutaneous biliary
drainage placement and eighteen months after removal of all biliary access. The patient is asymptomatic and has normal liver function tests.
This technique can be useful in morbidly obese patients who are at increased risk from surgical repair of biliary duct injuries.
