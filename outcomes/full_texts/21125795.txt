Dens evaginatus (DE) is a dental anomaly that occurs as an accessory tubercle on the occlusal or lingual surface of a tooth. The authors
provide a literature review and report a rare case in which DE occurs on multiple mandibular premolars and maxillary molars. The patient is
a 26-year-old Chinese woman, with a chief complaint of gingival bleeding. DE affecting teeth 17, 27, 35, and 45 was found during clinical
examination. For treatment of the patient, we reduced the opposing occluding teeth, while undertaking progressive grinding of the tubercles
for six months. We followed-up for a year. This suggests the importance of examining for multiple DE during clinical practice.
