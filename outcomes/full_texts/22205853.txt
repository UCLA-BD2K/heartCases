A 39-year-old woman presented to our hospital with upper abdominal pain. She had been taking anti-tuberculosis medications for 3 months
because of pulmonary tuberculosis. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a creamy discharge from an opening in the duodenal bulb (Fig. 1), and
abdominal computed tomography with coronal reformatting showed that the lymph nodes had eroded the adjacent duodenum, resulting in a small
oval collection of gas (Fig. 2). The continuous use of anti-tuberculosis medication resulted in complete healing of the duodenal fistula.
Tuberculous lesions of the duodenal bulb may primarily affect the duodenum or produce compression because of the enlarged lymph nodes. The
common complications of duodenal tuberculosis are fistulous communications with adjacent structures, perforation, and obstruction. Our case
was a rare but interesting case that showed a creamy discharge from a nododuodenal fistula resulting from tuberculosis. No potential
conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy identified creamy discharges from an opening in the
duodenal bulb. Abdominal computed tomogaraphy with coronal reformatting shows that the lymph nodes eroded the adjacent duodenum, resulting
in a small oval gas collection in the suprapancreatic lymph nodes with foci of low attenuation (arrow).
