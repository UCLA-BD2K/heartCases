Microdeletion of 22q11 is responsible for DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome, congenital conotruncal heart defects, and related
disorders. We report our experiences on prenatal diagnosis by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for 22q11 deletion in two fetuses
with tetralogy of Fallot. Karyotyping and FISH of the parents revealed that one fetus inherited the disease from maternal microdeletion.
These findings suggest the importance of performing FISH in pregnancies with prenatally detected tetralogy of Fallot.
