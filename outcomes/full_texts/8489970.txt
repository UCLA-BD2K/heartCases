secondary to dysplastic mucinous papillomatosis two years after she had undergone cholecystectomy and exploration of the common bile duct.
The gall bladder was dysplastic. It is suggested that the dysplastic glands removed from the common bile duct at the second operation either
represented seedlings from dysplastic areas of the gall bladder or were a manifestation of dysplastic field change.
