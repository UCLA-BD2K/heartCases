Gastrocolic fistula (GCF) is an abnormal communication between a portion of the stomach and the transverse colon. It is a rare entity and
could be due to benign or malignant disease. The gastric or colonic adenocarcinoma is the most common malignant cause, while lymphoma is
rarely reported. The cornerstone for detecting the fistula remains the barium enema. Barium meal and computed tomography are alternatives
for the diagnosis. Gastroscopy and colonoscopy are not first-line examinations to bring out the GCF, but they must be used to obtain
cytological and biopsy materials. The therapy for GCF remains surgical. A 36-year-old woman had a non-Hodgkin's gastric lymphoma for 15
years ago treated by chemotherapy. After complete remission, she presented with abdominal pain, fecal halitosis, feculent vomiting, chronic
diarrhea and weight loss of 15 kg. A palpable mass in the left hypochondriac region was found on abdominal examination. Gastroscopy revealed
a vegetating tumor on the fundus with fistulous orifice in the great curvature of the stomach. Barium meal showed early opacification of the
colon and a fistula between the stomach and transverse colon (A). Abdominal CT demonstrated a wall thickening of the great curvature of the
stomach with GCF (B). There is neither adjacent nor distant involvement by the lymphoma. According to Lugano staging system, the lymphoma
was classified as stage IIE. The patient was prepared for an en bloc resection of the involved stomach and colon but she died before
undergoing the operation. A) Barium meal; B) Abdominal computed tomography. The arrow shows the gastrocolic fistula
