blood transfusion and its occurrence is admitted to be globally underestimated. Each type of blood product is likely to cause TRALI. We
report here on two consecutive observations of TRALI caused by red blood cell concentrates, in which anti-HLA class I and class II
antibodies resulting from post-gravitational allo-immunization were evidenced in donors. HLA class I and II antigenic community between
recipients and donors' husbands were found and strong reacting IgG antibodies directed at several of those common antigens were detected in
the donors' serum. Both donors had more than 3 pregnancies, raising the issue of blood donor selection or of plasma reduction for cellular
products.
