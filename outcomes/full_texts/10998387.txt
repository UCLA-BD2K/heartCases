We describe two cases of Mycobacterium microti infection causing pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in HIV-seronegative immunocompetent patients in
Germany. The isolates were identified as M. microti of the llama and vole types, according to spoligotype patterns. Our data demonstrate
that M. microti can cause severe pulmonary TB in immunocompetent patients.
