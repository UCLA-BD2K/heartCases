We report a case of renin-secreting juxtaglomerular cell tumor which developed in a hypertensive 47-yr-old Korean man. Presumptive clinical
diagnosis was made before surgery based on the high level of plasma renin and the radiologic evidence of renal mass. Grossly, a round,
bulging, well-encapsulated mass of 3 x 3 cm was located in the mid-portion of the right kidney. On microscopic examination, the tumor was
composed of ovoid to polyhedral cells with bland nuclei, indistinct nucleoli and light eosinophilic cytoplasm. The immunostaining for renin
showed strong positivity in the cytoplasm of tumor cells. The characteristic rhomboid shaped renin protogranules were observed in
ultrastructural analysis.
