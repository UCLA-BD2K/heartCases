Takayasu's arteritis is a chronic inflammatory disease that produces a narrowing of the aorta and its major branches. Fibrosis and
thickening of the arterial wall often occur in later stages, resulting in a cerebrovascular accident. The authors report two young women
patients who presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and occlusive cerebrovasular disease associated with Takayasu's arteritis. Both
patients had sudden headache and hemiparesis. Physical examination showed weak radial pulse, carotid bruit, and asymmetrical blood pressure.
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated in both patients. SAH was confirmed by brain computerized tomography (CT) or lumbar
puncture. Occlusive cerebrovascular disease was diagnosed by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), brain magnetic resonance angiography
(MRA), and cerebral angiography. The findings of aortography and cerebral angiography were compatible with Takayasu's arteritis, but
intracranial aneurysm was not found in either patient.
