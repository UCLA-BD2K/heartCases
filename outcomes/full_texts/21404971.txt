Management of mid-root fractures presents a formidable challenge for clinicians because of the difficulty of achieving a stable reunion of
fracture fragments. This article presents two varied treatment options for mid-root fractures. A 15-year-old female reported an impact
injury to the maxillary anterior teeth 2 days after its occurrence. Clinically, the maxillary left central incisor was palatally-extruded
with a negative vitality response and radiographic evidence of an oblique fracture at the middle third of the root. An endodontic implant
was employed which utilized an open technique and has been on follow-up for ten months. A 32-year-old male reported an injury, which
resulted in a mobile maxillary right central incisor, three months after its occurrence. Through clinical and radiographic means, a
discolored, extruded, and non-vital maxillary right central incisor with an oblique root fracture at the alveolar-crest level was observed.
Exploratory surgery was performed; an apical barrier was created with a mineral trioxide aggregate and obturated with gutta percha. The
fragments were stabilized with a fiber post and patient has been on follow-up for five months. Short-term follow-up for both of the cases
showed promising results both clinically and radiographically.
