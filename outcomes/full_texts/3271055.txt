A case of rather typical Crohn's disease in a 10 year old girl is described. She had suffered from intractable abdominal pain, diarrhea and
fever for 1 year. Eventual right hemicolectomy revealed diffuse involvement of terminal ileum, cecum and ascending colon by confluent
ulcerations and transmural inflammation. Histologically there were numerous well developed non-caseating granulomas scattered transmurally
and in regional lymph nodes. Deep penetrating ulcerations were characteristic. Acid fast staining failed to demonstrate any organism. The
rarity of Crohn's disease in Korea and this occurrence in pediatric age prompted this report.
