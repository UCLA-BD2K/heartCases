A 15 month old boy with a stage IV right suprarenal gland neuroblastoma showed a number of raised biochemical parameters, whilst
catecholamines and skeletal survey were normal. Treatment with peptichemio failed to give a clinical response. Histological evidence of
neuroblastoma infiltration in the bone marrow aspirate was absent. Immunofluorescence on sedimented cells was negative using antibody
UJ223.8, PI153/3 and H11; only UJ308 and to a lesser extent UJ13A gave positive results. After 21 days, however, the same cells in culture
showed highly differentiated dendritic processes. Thirty-seven percent metaphases from bone marrow aspirate showed the following karyotype
45XY, del (1) (p32), and two markers. Mar1 = der (2) t (2; 2) (2qter----2q14::2p24----2qter). Mar2 = der (15) t (15; 2) (15qter----
15p11::2p11----2pter). Treatment with methotrexate reduced the aberrant mitoses rate to 2%. N-myc in situ hybridisation showed significant
signal on both markers confirming the cytogenetic interpretation. Peripheral blood lymphocytes at 72 h showed a higher level of breaks per
cell than control. After treatment with aphidicolin (APC) or methotrexate (MTX) for the last 24 h, to induce fragile sites, the incidence of
breaks per cells was increased. Moreover 11.4% of APC-induced breaks were in 1p31-32 (mean of normal controls = 2.3%). The mother presented
an increased sensitivity to the inducibility of fragile sites, while the father's lymphocytes showed values within the control range. The
genetic changes produced by the abnormalities on chromosomes 1 and 2 might be related to tumour progression. Furthermore this is the first
description of correlation between a high frequency of fragile site 1p31-32 induced by APC in the patient's lymphocytes and deletion of 1p32
in tumour cells. The interpretation of these findings and of other similar correlations needs further study.
