Several months after left radical mastectomy without irradiation therapy for breast cancer, a 74-year-old woman developed severe edema on
the homolateral arm extending to the axilla. Ten years later, purplish to brownish blotch and nodules accompanied with heating sensation and
pain appeared and increased in size gradually on the left forearm. The patient was treated by irradiation therapy under the clinical and
histopathologic diagnosis of Stewart-Treves syndrome and almost all of the skin lesions and symptoms disappeared after irradiation of 6450
rads.
