was diagnosed as Dupuytren's contracture (Fig.). It is a benign fibroproliferative disorder of the palmer and digital fascia, giving rise to
the formation of nodules and cords leading to flexion contracture of metacorpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints. Common risk
factors for Dupuytren's contracture include a family history of the disorder, diabetes, alcohol consumption, epilepsy, HIV infection and the
use of vibratory machinery. Disease is more frequent in males than in females. There is no cure for the disease. Standard treatment consists
of fasciotomy, but other methods of treatment like laser therapy, collagenolytic fasciotomy and IFN (interferons) are also emerging.
Steroids are helpful in reducing symptoms though these do not alter the natural course of the disease. The pathogenesis of Dupuytren's is
still unknown. Dupuytren's contracture involving both hands.
