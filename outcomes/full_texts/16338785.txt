BACKGROUND: Transmission of HIV through breastfeeding is well documented. The World Health Organisation advise HIV-infected women in
developed countries to use alternatives to breastfeeding together with highly active antiretroviral therapy and optimal management of
delivery to prevent transmission of HIV to their infant. CASE REPORT: We present the case of an HIV-infected woman electing to exclusively
breastfeed for six months and applying milk pasteurisation techniques without transmission to her infant. Two paired samples of her breast
milk were tested for HIV RNA prior to and after pasteurisation. The first pair of specimens reported no change in HIV RNA copy number, the
second pair of specimens reported an increase in copy number. DISCUSSION: This technique, the evidence for HIV inactivation and the effects
pasteurisation has on nutritional and immunological components of breast milk are discussed. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we believe there is
currently insufficient data to recommend this technique either as a safe alternative to formula feeding in resource-rich countries or as a
method for providing intact immunological components of breast milk to the infant.
