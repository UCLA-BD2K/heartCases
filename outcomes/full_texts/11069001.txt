Hypercalcemia in accelerated phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is very rare. Its pathogenesis is considered humoral hypercalcemia
of malignancies mediated by parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP). In severe hypercalcemia, calcifications in kidneys, skin, vessels,
heart, and stomach may occur. Our two cases were admitted because of severe hypercalcemia in accelerated phase of CML. On Tc-99m methylene
diphosphonate (MDP) bone scintigraphies, a marked tracer accumulation was seen in the lung, heart, stomach and kidney. We report increased
tracer accumulation of multiple organs on Tc-99m MDP bone scintigraphy in two rare hypercalcemic patients with CML.
