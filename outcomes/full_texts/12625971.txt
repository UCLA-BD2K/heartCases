Myiasis is a parasitic infestation caused by the larvae of several fly species. Diagnosis and treatment are simple. The location of this
infestation at the vulvar area is, however, an extremely rare occurrence. The authors present two cases of vulvar myiasis affecting pregnant
women. The first case is a 19-year-old pregnant girl with vulvar myiasis and concomitant syphilis, vaginal trichomoniasis and genital
candidiasis. The patient was also HIV-positive. The second case is a 17-year-old pregnant girl with vulvar myiasis associated with extensive
vulvar condyloma acuminatum lesions.
