The patient was a 50-year-old woman who presented intermittent mild fever with elevated liver enzymes for 12 years. The liver biopsy showed
diffuse portal and sinusoidal involvement of lymphoid cells with minimal atypia and epithelioid histiocytic granuloma formation. Subsequent
bone marrow biopsy showed lymphomatous involvement. The lymphocytes infiltrating the liver were reactive for T-cell marker and showed TCR
gamma gene rearrangement. The patient was diagnosed as primary peripheral T-cell lymphoma of the liver. Indolent clinical course and
resemblance with hepatitis were considered to be a rare and unique feature of this case.
