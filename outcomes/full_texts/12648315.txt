BACKGROUND: Group A streptococcal (GAS) toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an uncommon, but life-threatening infection during pregnancy and
should be considered in rapid onset of shock. Most cases described in the literature have occurred in the puerperium. We report a case of
GAS TSS occurring during the third trimester of pregnancy in a previously healthy woman. CASE: A 31-year-old female, who was 34 weeks
pregnant, presented with fevers and a prodromal 'flu-like' illness. She rapidly developed shock and multiorgan failure. Blood cultures
revealed GAS bacteremia and the patient met criteria for streptococcal TSS. Despite her eventual recovery, her infant died on postpartum day
15 as a consequence of the mother's TSS. CONCLUSIONS: This case is unusual in that there were no identifiable initiating events or source of
the streptococcal infection, and the TSS developed during pregnancy rather than after delivery. Early recognition of GAS infections is
important given the rapid onset and high morbidity and mortality associated with these infections. This is the first reported case utilizing
intravenous immunoglobulin for GAS TSS in the puerperium.
