Markedly effeminate behavior in a young boy is a source of concern and confusion for parents, teachers, and the child. It also represents a
therapeutic dilemma for the child psychiatrist. The case of a five-year-old boy with gender identity disorder of childhood is presented and
the literature on hypotheses of etiology, treatment, and long-term follow-up is reviewed. The ethical and philosophical questions posed by
such a case are discussed.
