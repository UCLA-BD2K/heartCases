A case history of the induction of asthma and chemical sensitivity in a 42-year-old registered nurse illustrates several of the
characteristic features of multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). This patient's problems started shortly after moving into a new home under
construction, with associated chemical exposures. Other MCS patients report the onset of the condition with other chemical exposures such as
those encountered at their places of work or use of pesticides at their residences. Patients often describe a spreading phenomenon of
increasing intolerance to commonly encountered chemicals at concentrations well tolerated by other people. Symptoms usually wax and wane
with exposures, and are more likely to occur in patients or families with preexisting histories of migraine or with classical allergies.
Idiosyncratic medication reactions (especially to preservative chemicals) are common in MCS patients, as are dysautonomia symptoms (such as
vascular instability) and poor temperature regulation. Myalgia and joint pains and food intolerance are common features as well.
Contamination with xenobiotic chemicals is frequently found in these patients when they are tested. Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome is
a recently identified condition that exhibits features of both asthma and chemical sensitivity. MCS patients frequently have patterns of
neurotoxic brain metabolism that can be confirmed on single photo emission computed tomography imaging.
