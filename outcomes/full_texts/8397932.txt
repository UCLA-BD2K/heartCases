Urethral caruncles are the most common benign tumors in the female urethra, and are usually found in the posterior lip of the urethral
meatus of post-menopausal women. It is very rare in young girls. Its etiology is unknown. We add a case of urethral caruncle occurring in a
2 year and 5 month-old girl's mid-urethra. We believe that further accumulation of unusual cases may be helpful in discovering the
pathogenesis.
