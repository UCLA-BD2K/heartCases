Collagen type XVIII (C18) is a nonfibrillar collagen of basement membranes. Its C-terminal fragment, endostatin, has been identified as an
inhibitor of angiogenesis. C18 is predominantly expressed by hepatocytes of normal, cirrhotic and neoplastic liver. We compared the patterns
of C18 RNA-expression in colonic adenocarcinoma metastases, which represent the most frequently occurring liver tumours, to normal colon
mucosa, to primary colon cancers and to ovarian cancers which are often morphologically similar to colonic cancer or metastasis. Two
C18-specific RNA-probes were generated to perform in situ hybridization combined with immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin, vimentin and the
endothelial marker CD31, in order to characterize the C18-expressing cells. C18/endostatin protein was localized by immunohistology. In
colorectal carcinomas and their liver metastases high levels of C18 transcripts were observed in endothelial cells and
fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, whereas C18 RNA was virtually absent from carcinoma cells. Ovarian carcinomas displayed high C18 RNA expression
both in carcinoma and stromal cells, indicating that induction of C18 transcription in tumour stromal cells is independent of the ability of
carcinoma cells to express C18. While the role of tumour cell derived C18 in cancer growth regulation remains unknown, stimulation of
proteolysis of the locally strongly expressed C18 to endostatin could offer an attractive approach for a targeted antineoplastic therapy. Â©
