A woman aged 45 years was presented with hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis and hypomagnesemia associated with renal potassium and magnesium
wasting. Her 24-hour urinary calcium excretion was strikingly low despite normocalcemia and normal creatinine clearance, which is one of
characteristic findings of Gitelman's syndrome (GS). She was evaluated for the responses following Mg supplementation for 10 days, which
showed marked increments in serum potassium and magnesium as well as improvements of the degree of renal potassium wasting and
hypocalciuria. This amelioration of abnormal biochemical pictures in this patient after Mg supplementation proposes that the hypokalemia
with renal potassium wasting and hypocalciuria may be caused by abnormal Mg metabolism.
