pancreatic duct fistula in chronic pancreatitis is rare. It is, however, important to diagnose this condition particularly in patients
having chronic pancreatitis, since it may result in a life-threatening situation. The diagnosis is usually difficult to establish and it may
take repeated admissions for intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding until the real source is recognized. Clinical attacks of epigastric pain
followed by GI-bleeding 30â€“40 minutes later are characteristic. Occasionally these attacks are followed by transient jaundice. The present
case report describes this rare complication and reviews the current literature.
