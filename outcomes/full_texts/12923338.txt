This report describes an uncommon case of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) accompanying infundibular stenosis of the right
ventricle treated by alcohol ablation therapy, in a 28-yr-old male patient presenting with dyspnea on exertion. HOCM with infundibular
stenosis was detected by echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization and patient has dynamic obstructions of both ventricular outflow tracts.
We performed alcohol ablation therapy to improve clinical symptoms and to relieve dynamic obstructions of both ventricular outflow tracts.
This is the first case in which HOCM with infundibular stenosis of the right ventricle was treated by alcohol ablation therapy.
