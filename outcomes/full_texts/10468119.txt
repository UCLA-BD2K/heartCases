hemihepatectomy adequate venous drainage of the remaining liver is required. Most metastases close to the confluence of the superior hepatic
veins are considered unresectable because hepatic venous outflow after resection would be compromised. In 10–25% of people, the inferior
right hepatic vein is of large calibre. Thus the superior hepatic veins may be sacrificed and hepatic function preserved if a large inferior
right hepatic vein is present. A patient with involvement of segments 2, 4 and 8 by metastatic colorectal cancer is presented. This patient
had a large inferior right hepatic vein, and so was able to undergo an extended left hemihepatectomy with ligation of all superior hepatic
veins. Subsequent quality of life was maintained. This case illustrates that an ‘unresectable’ hepatic lesion can be actually resectable if
an alternative venous drainage is present. A pre-operative search for a prominent inferior right hepatic vein by ultrasound, computerised
tomography, or even magnetic resonance imaging should be considered in these cases.
