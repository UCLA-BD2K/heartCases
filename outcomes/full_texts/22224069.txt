We describe a case of severe leukocytosis caused by leukemic mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), complicated by leukostasis with myocardial
infarction in which leukapheresis was used in the initial management. A 73-year-old male presented to the emergency department because of
fatigue and thoracic pain. Blood count revealed 630 × 109/L WBC (white blood cells). The electrocardiogram showed ST-elevation with an
increase of troponin and creatinine kinase. The diagnosis was ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) induced and complicated by
leukostasis. Immunophenotyping, morphology, cytogenetic and fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization analysis revealed the diagnosis of a blastoid
variant of MCL. To remove leukocytes rapidly, leukapheresis was performed in the intensive care unit. Based on the differential blood count
with 95% blasts, which were assigned to the lymphocyte population by the automatic hematology analyzer, leukapheresis procedures were then
performed with the mononuclear cell standard program on the Spectra cell separator. The patient was treated with daily leukapheresis for 3
days. The WBC count decreased to 174 × 109/L after the third leukapheresis, with a 72% reduction. After the second apheresis, treatment with
vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone was started. The patient fully recovered in the further course of the treatment. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first report on blastoid MCL with leukostasis associated with a STEMI that was successfully treated by
leukapheresis. Effective harvest of circulating lymphoma cells by leukapheresis requires adaptation of instrument settings based on the
results of the differential blood count prior to apheresis.
