Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum has rarely been reported to cause disease in humans, despite its common presence in the flora of the
upper respiratory tract. We report here a case of exudative pharyngitis with pseudomembrane possibly caused by C. pseudodiphtheriticum in a
4-year-old girl. The case initially triggered clinical and laboratory suspicion of diphtheria. Because C. pseudodiphtheriticum can be easily
confused with Corynebacterium diphtheriae in Gram stain, clarification of its role in the pathogenesis of exudative pharyngitis in otherwise
healthy persons is of public health importance. Simple and rapid screening tests to differentiate C. pseudodiphtheriticum from C.
diphtheriae should be performed to prevent unnecessary concern in the community and unnecessary outbreak control measures.
