neoplasm that arises from ductal epithelial cells. This entity is distinct from the more commonly known Mucinous Cystadenoma or Mucinous
Cystadenocarcinoma. Despite this distinction, it has been erroneously categorized with these more common cystic neoplasms. Characteristic
clinical presentation, radiographic, and endoscopic findings help distinguish this neoplasm from the cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas.
Histopathologic identification is not crucial to the preoperative diagnosis. This neoplasm is considered to represent a premalignant
condition and, therefore, surgical resection is warranted. Prognosis, following resection, is felt to be curative for the majority of
patients. We present two cases of Mucin Hypersecreting Intraductal Papillary Neoplasm and discuss their diagnosis and surgical therapy.
