difficult to diagnose. Due to the small clinical experience with duodenal malignancies their prognosis is unknown and resection is the
treatment of choice. Case report Adding to a small series of incidental tumours, we report the case of a 65-year-old patient with primary
extranodal (MALT-) lymphoma of the duodenum infiltrating the pancreatic head. The patient was admitted because of anaemia and epigastric
discomfort with a history of Helicobacter- pylori associated gastric ulceration. Physical examination and bloodchemical values were
otherwise normal. Endoscopy revealed duodenal ulceration but the biopsies taken from the ulceration did not give any evidence of malignancy
or residual Helicobacter pylori infection. But MRT showed a circular intramural tumour of the duodenum. On laparotomy a large duodenal
tumour adherent to the pancreatic head was found and a Whipple procedure was performed. Conclusion Apart from describing the case of a rare
lymphoproliferative disorder of the duodenum, this report illustrates the diagnostic difficulties with uncommon neoplasm's of the
duodenopancreatic region and the value of MRT prior to resection of a duodenopancreatic mass.
