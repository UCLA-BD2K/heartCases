A 66-year-old female presented with a large abdominal mass and accompanying systemic complaints of abdominal pain, constipation. and fever.
On exploratory laparotomy, the mass was found to be a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon with metastasis to the
left ovary. A primary colorectal carcinoma that has metastasized to the ovaries can be difficult to distinguish clinically from an advanced
primary ovarian tumor. Histology and tumor markers are currently the most useful tools available in making an accurate diagnosis. If the
nature of the primary tumor is uncertain and the initial response to chemotherapy is poor, the patient's prognosis will also he poor. Though
controversy exists regarding the role of prophylactic bilateral oophorectomy during resection for primary colorectal cancer, later confusion
can be avoided by performing this procedure when the colorectal carcinoma is first diagnosed. However the possibility of a concurrent
primary ovarian tumor must not be overlooked.
