Twenty-one multifocal urinary tract transitional cell carcinomas, mostly bladder tumours, from a total of six patients were processed for
cytogenetic analysis after short-term culturing of the tumour cells. Karyotypically related, often identical, cytogenetically complex clones
were found in all informative tumours from each case, including the recurrent tumours. Rearrangement of chromosome 9, leading to loss of
material from the short and/or the long arm, was seen in all cases, indicating that this is an early, pathogenetically important event in
transitional cell carcinogenesis. The presence of related clones with great karyotypic similarity in anatomically distinct tumours from the
same bladder indicates that multifocal uroepithelial tumours have a monoclonal origin and arise via intraluminal seeding of viable cancer
cells shed from the original tumour. Later lesions may develop also from cells shed from the so called second primary tumours. The
relatively complex karyotypes seen in all lesions from most cases argue that the seeding of tumour cells is a late event that succeeds the
acquisition by them of multiple secondary genetic abnormalities. Â© 1999 Cancer Research Campaign
