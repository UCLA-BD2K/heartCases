Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) occurs in most infections with Sin Nombre virus and other North American hantaviruses. We report five
cases of acute hantavirus infection that did not fit the HPS case definition. The patients had characteristic prodromal symptoms without
severe pulmonary involvement. These cases suggest that surveillance for HPS may need to be expanded.
