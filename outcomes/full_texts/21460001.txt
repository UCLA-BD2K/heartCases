A 17-year-old girl from Togo with a β-thalassemia maior was seen at an emergency department with high fever, coma, and severe anemia (Hb < 3
g/dL). No malaria parasites were found on thin film and thick smears in the first few days of the infection. Despite the failure to observe
Plasmodium intraerythrocytic forms in the bloodstream, many white blood cells showed brown, birefringent, intracytoplasmic inclusions (thick
arrows) consistent with malarial pigment (hemozoin).The detection of intraleucocytic hemozoin with a negative malaria smear has to be
considered as strongly suggestive of Plasmodium falciparum infection1 (Figure 1). Additional blood specimens were analyzed by a pan-human
Plasmodium polymerase chain reaction and resulted positives. Further thin films and thick smears were prepared from fingerprick and
venipuncture the next day, and they showed visible intraerythrocytic rings. The patient was treated with IV quinine and recovered
completely. Intracytoplasmatic hemozoin granules (arrow) Giemsa thin films (100× magnification). Authors' addresses: Romualdo Grande,
