Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary renal disease. There are some reports in the literature
concerning unilateral ADPKD. However, in adults, only a few cases of unilateral ADPKD with agenesis of contralateral kidney have been
reported. We present a case of unilateral ADPKD with agenesis of contralateral kidney in a 66-yr-old man. Radiographic images showed the
enlarged right kidney with multiple variable-sized cysts and the absence of the left kidney. The diagnosis of ADPKD was confirmed by the
family screening. The patient received maintenance hemodialysis for endstage renal disease. We report a case of unilateral ADPKD associated
with contralateral renal agenesis in a 66-yr-old male patient with a literature review.
