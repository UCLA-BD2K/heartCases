Cells of a patient with Turcot's syndrome and of her parents were evaluated for the presence of molecular alterations in the p53 and the Ki-
ras gene. Deletions on chromosome 17p, overexpression and point mutations of the p53 gene as well as mutations of the Ki-ras gene were
detected in primary and metastatic tumour but not in the germline of the patient nor in her parents.
