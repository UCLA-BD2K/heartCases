We report three autopsy cases of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in fetuses with a review of literature. The clinical
manifestations in these cases of congenital CMV infection include intrauterine fetal death, hydrops fetalis, and CMV pneumonia associated
with cardiovascular defect. The pathological characteristics were as follows: 1) the kidney was the most frequently involved organ, followed
by lung and liver, 2) CMV inclusions were found predominantly in epithelial cells and to a lesser degree in endothelial cells, 3)
intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cells were frequently involved, and 4) inflammatory reaction around CMV inclusions was not prominent in
the early stage of pregnancy. Diagnostic confirmation was obtained by in situ hybridization (ISH) using a biotinylated CMV-DNA probe, which
demonstrated intranuclear inclusions and sometimes recognized cells that did not show intranuclear inclusion.
