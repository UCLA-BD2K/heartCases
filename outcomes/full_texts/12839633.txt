peripartum period. Case: A case at our institution and a review of the literature were analyzed. A total of 15 cases were discovered. The
onset of illness was during pregnancy (40% of cases), within 3 weeks postpartum (40%) or post-abortion (20%), and the presentation was
usually acute (< 7 days in 67% of cases). Frequent manifestations included localized pain in the hips or buttock, sacroiliac joint
tenderness and fever. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging revealed joint involvement in all cases tested. Microbiology was
confirmed by blood (40%) or joint aspirate (75%), and most patients were treated with antibiotics. Surgical intervention took place in five
cases. Pretermlabor was reported in only one case. All patients respondedwell to therapy without locomotive disability, and persistent pain
was uncommon. Conclusion: Septic sacroiliitis should be considered in peripartum patients who present with fever and severe localized pain.
Medical management is usually curative, and without an adverse effect on pregnancy.
