We Describe a case of ovarian serous cystadenoma having Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor, well differentiated, in the cystic septum. Well
differentiated Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor coexisting with other tumor, including serous tumor, has not yet been described. In all cases of
Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor with heterologous components or other tumors, the androblastomatous components are intermediately or poorly
differentiated. The present case revealed a well differentiated Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor arising in a septum of serous cystadenoma, as a
circumscribed nodule. With these findings, we discuss the possibility of this Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor, considered a mural nodule, which is
well established in cystic common epithelial tumors of the ovary.
