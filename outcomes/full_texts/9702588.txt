BACKGROUND: Transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration of ovarian endometrioma has been applied and emphasized as a safe and simple
procedure. CASE: Two 27-year-old infertile women, both gravida 0, para 0, underwent medical follow-up examinations for cases of ovarian
endometrioma. Both had undergone transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration of ovarian endometrioma. Because both were continuously febrile
and had abdominal pain and cysts with tenderness in spite of antibiotic therapies, both underwent laparotomies for treatment. In both cases,
enucleation of the ovarian abscess revealed purulent and malodorous fluid that demonstrated Peptostreptococcus magnus in culture.
CONCLUSION: We theorize that following transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration of ovarian endometrioma and fixation with pure ethanol,
anaerobic infection by P. magnus occurred, and a cyst formed in the abscess.
