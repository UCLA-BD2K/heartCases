abundant mucus within the intra- or extrahepatic biliary tree. A variety of hepatobiliary and pancreatic neoplasms are mucin producing and
have been associated with the development of mucobilia including biliary mucinosis, biliary papillomatosis, mucin-producing
cholangiocarcinoma (MPCC), or cystic neoplasms of the pancreas or biliary tree (cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma). We report the case of 46
year-old male with a biliary cystadenocarcinoma of the caudate lobe which resulted in chronic biliary obstruction and relapsing cholangitis.
A review of the literature for both mucobilia and biliary cystadenocarcinoma is provided along with a discussion addressing the clinical
presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis for this rare entity.
