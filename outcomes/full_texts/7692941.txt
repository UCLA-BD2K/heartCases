reported. The tumour was metastatic at presentation at which time it was excised. Pancreatic duct obstruction occurred 3 years after
excision causing severe pain on eating. Major palliative surgery, in the form of a pancreatico-jejunostomy, cured the severe symptoms. The
patient survives, largely symptom free, over six years after original excision. This case illustrates the need for aggressive management of
symptoms in tumours in which long term survival is possible despite locally advanced or metastatic disease. ABBREVIATIONS: VIP — vasoactive
intestinal peptide. CT — computed tomography. GI — gastrointestinal. HPP — human pancreatic polypeptide. APUD — amine precursor uptake and
decarboxylation.
