A case of a 36-yr-old woman with retroperitoneal synovial sarcoma is described. Her presenting symptom was epigastric pain that radiating to
the back. On radiologic study, bulky retropancreatic soft tissue mass was detected which showed cystic and solid components. At operation,
complete resection of the tumor was not possible because of the adhesion to the vena cava and the liver. During the follow-up, extensive
tumor recurrence and liver metastasis were revealed. Primary retroperitoneal synovial sarcoma is a very rare malignant tumor with high
mortality and recurrence rates. Retroperitoneal synovial sarcoma usually appears as a nonspecific soft tissue mass that do not have specific
imaging features differentiating it from other mesenchymal tumors. However general radiologic findings and anatomic location of the tumor
may help the diagnosis. In addition, synovial sarcoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of retroperitoneal soft tissue mass
detected in young adults.
