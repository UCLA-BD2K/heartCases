A post-operative diabetic patient who had been treated for Serratia marcescens bacterial sepsis developed recurrent thrombosis of the left
femoral artery following intra-arterial instrumentation. Pathological examination of arterial thrombus ultimately demonstrated invasive
mucormycosis of the femoral artery and cultures of this material grew Rhizopus oryzae. The occurrence of cutaneous and subcutaneous
mucormycosis is reviewed, as well as recently recognized nosocomial risk factors for mucormycosis, such as elasticized bandages and wound
dressings.
