A 54 year old asymptomatic woman presented with three incidentally noted intraoral masses in January 2013, in the outpatients department of
Olaryngology, Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. The patient's medical history was unremarkable. She reported no associated pain,
pruritus, or other symptoms. Clinical examination revealed three hard, sessile nodules with normal overlying mucosa on the hard palate
(Fig.). No notable abnormalities were identified on radiographs. Torus palatinus, the most common intraoral exostosis among postmenopausal
women, is a non pathologic bony overgrowth in the midpalatine region. The growth of torus palatinus is gradual, becoming greater in the
second or the third decade of life. The torus palatinus can be unilobular or polylobulated, as well as flat or spindle-shaped. Removal of
the palatal tori is not always necessary except for offering patients another alternative for rehabilitating the jaw by means of a
prosthetic implant. Since this patient was asymptomatic, no surgical intervention was required. Triple torus palatinus.
