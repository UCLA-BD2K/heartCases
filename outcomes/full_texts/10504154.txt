A petrochemical worker with aplastic anemia was referred to our hospital. He worked in a petroleum resin-producing factory and had been
exposed to low-level benzene while packaging the powder resin and pouring lime into a deactivation tank. According to the yearly
environmental survey of the working area, the airborne benzene level was approximately 0.28 ppm. Exposure to benzene, a common chemical used
widely in industry, may progressively lead to pancytopenia, aplastic anemia, and leukemia. The hematotoxicity of benzene is related to the
amount and duration of exposure. Most risk predictions for benzene exposures have been based on rubber workers who were exposed to high
concentrations. In the petroleum industry, the concentration of benzene is relatively low, and there are disputes over the toxicity of low-
level benzene because of a lack of evidence. In this paper we report the case of aplastic anemia induced by low-level benzene exposure.
