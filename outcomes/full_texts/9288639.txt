Hepatoblastoma is thought to originate from embryonal hepatic tissue, and most of these tumors occur in children under the age of 2 years.
Hepatoblastoma in adults is extremely rare, and the prognosis is much worse than the mixed hepatoblastoma of childhood. We experienced a
case of mixed hepatoblastoma in a 51 year old female patient. She had been suffering from a mild pain and a palpable lump in the epigastric
area. Serum AFP was 43,850 ng/ml. Computerized tomography and selective abdominal angiography showed a large low-density mass. With a
suspicion of hepatocellular carcinoma of the left lobe, a left lateral segmentectomy was performed. The external surface showed a huge
protruding mass and the capsule was previously ruptured. On section, the tumor was a 11 x 7 cm sized expanding mass which had a variegated
surface composed of yellow-white friable tissue with multifocal hemorrhagic areas. Microscopic examination revealed a tumor consisted of
epithelial and mesenchymal elements. The mesenchymal cells were spindle in shape and proliferated over the whole tumor with focal
osteosarcomatous differentiation. The epithelial components showed well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma-like areas, poorly
differentiated acinar or tubular structures.
