old man underwent elective biological aortic valve replacement. Two weeks after surgery, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a small
pericardial effusion. On the following day, the patient suffered from syncope. A repeated TTE revealed a "giant" echo-dense mass (90x80 mm)
occupying the entire right atrium and severely limiting tricuspid valve inflow. Although the initial differential diagnosis included the
development of an intracavitary process, the rapidly-growing mass with a characteristic echo‑lucent layer at its atrial aspect (consistent
with the atrial wall and visceral pericardium) (arrows) led to the final diagnosis of a pericardial hematoma mimicking a huge atrial mass.
Emergency surgical exploration confirmed the diagnosis. Sources of Funding There were no external funding sources for this study. Study
