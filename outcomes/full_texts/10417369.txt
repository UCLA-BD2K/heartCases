Chronic arsenical intoxication can still be found in environmental and industrial settings. Symptoms of chronic arsenic intoxication include
general pigmentation or focal "raindrop" pigmentation of the skin and the appearance of hyperkeratosis of the palms of the hands and soles
of the feet. In addition to arsenic-related skin diseases including keratosis, Bowen's disease, basal-cell-carcinoma, and squamous-cell
carcinoma, there is also an increased risk of some internal malignancies. Arsenic-related diseases are common in areas of the world where
the drinking water has a high arsenic content. In this paper, we describe a 35-year-old male patient who had arsenic-related keratosis,
squamous-cell carcinoma in the palmar area of his left hand, and Bowen's disease on his left thigh. The patient worked in a borax mine for
15 years, so he was exposed to arsenic in drinking water, airborne arsenic in his workplace, and had direct contact. The patient was treated
for 11 months for arsenic-related keratosis until an axillary lymph node metastasis occurred; the lesion was excised and diagnosed to be
malignant. Bowen's disease was detected when the patient was being treated for cancer. No other malignancy was found. The patient is still
receiving regular follow-up care.
