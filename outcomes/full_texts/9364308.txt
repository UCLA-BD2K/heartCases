A flat depressed early colon cancer (FDEC) is characterized by non-polypoid growth pattern, no association of adenomatous tissues and a
tendency of even small lesions toward submucosal invasion and lymph node metastasis. It supports de novo carcinogenesis of colorectal
cancer, although most colorectal cancers arise in pre-existing adenoma (adenoma-carcinoma sequence). There have been few reports of small
depressed cancers because of the difficulty in colonoscopic detection and the rapid development to ulcerating advanced cancers. We report a
case of flat depressed early colon cancer confined to mucosa detected by indigo carmine contrast colonoscopy.
