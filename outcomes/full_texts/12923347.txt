Neuroblastomas are derived from the neural crest ectoderm, and are the most common solid abdominal masses of infancy. Congenital
neuroblastoma, however, is rare. We report a rare case of congenital neuroblastoma with multiple metastases found at autopsy, performed at 2
days after birth. He was born by cesarian section and weighed 2,350 g. His respiration was weak and abdomen was distended. The patient died
2 days after birth. Postmortem examination revealed a relatively well demarcated ovoid mass, in the left adrenal, with necrosis and
hemorrhage. Multiple small metastatic tumor nodules in the liver, lung, kidney, brain, rib, thyroid glands, and spleen, were noted. The
histopathological pictures confirmed the diagnosis of neuroblastoma of the adrenal with multiple metastasis.
