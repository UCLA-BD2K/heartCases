massive lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding. Angiography demonstrated a solitary varix in the caecum which was found at laparotomy to be
entering the bowel wall at the site ofadhesions from a previous appendicectomy. The portal pressure was found to be raised. Aright
hemicolectomy stopped the blood loss, but she subsequently died ofliver failure. Solitary colonic varices associated with adhesions are
extremely rare and their optimal management has not been established.
