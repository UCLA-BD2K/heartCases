The phenomenology and dynamics of shame have been largely overlooked in the psychoanalytic and psychological literature. The emerging
literature now suggests that shame may play a vital role in autonomy and personality development, symptom formation, character pathology,
and interpersonal relationships. This paper attempts to describe shame phenomena and identify shame dynamics. The role of shame in the
understanding and treatment of schizophrenic individuals is then demonstrated through reference to the writings of Frieda Fromm-Reichmann
and examples from the author's clinical work.
