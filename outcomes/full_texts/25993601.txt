A 90-year-old asymptomatic patient with atrial fibrillation underwent a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for the assessment of
thrombus. The TEE examination evidenced mitral valve anterior leaflet prolapse with moderate to severe eccentric regurgitation. Three-
dimensional (3D)-TEE was performed and showed chordal rupture (A2) related to the anterior scallop of the mitral valve (Figure 1 e video 1).
In this case, 3D-TEE provided additional anatomical information regarding the mitral valve, allowing the diagnosis of flail leaflet and
chordal rupture, not assessed by the 2D evaluation. 2D-TEE, four-chamber view showing mitral valve prolapse at 0째 (A) e 34째 (B) rotation of
imaging array. C and D. 2D TEE color flow mapping evidencing eccentric mitral regurgitation, directed posteriorly at 0째 (C) and 138째 (D)
rotation of imaging array. E and F. 3D-TEE images showing the mitral valve prolapse of the anterior leaflet (A2) (E, arrow), in a surgical
view (from the left atrium, LA) and chordal rupture (F, arrow). TEE: transesophageal echocardiography; RA: right atrium; RV: right
ventricule; LV: left ventricule; AO: aorta. Additional Supporting Information: Real time 3D TEE cine loops evidence chordal rupture (A2)
associated with mitral valve prolapse.
