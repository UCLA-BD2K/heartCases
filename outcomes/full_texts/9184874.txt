manifested by cystic dilatation of the extra or intrahepatic biliary tree or both. It is most frequently found in Orientals and in females.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is a valuable imaging technique in the diagnosis of choledochal cysts in adults. Additionaly,
in selected cases, a choledochocele may be effectively managed by endoscopic sphincterotomy. We present clinical and endoscopic findings of
six adult patients with choledochal cysts. Clinical symptoms were characterized by abdominal pain, jaundice and cholangitis. Associated
hepatobiliary pathologic findings included cholelithiasis, recurrent acute pancreatitis, gallbladder carcinoma, Cystolithiasis,
choledocholithiasis, biliary stricture and hepatic abscess.
