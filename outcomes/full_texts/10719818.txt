We present a typical case of Goodpasture's syndrome with massive pulmonary hemorrhage and acute deterioration of renal function. A 20-year-
old male was admitted due to severe azotemia (blood urea nitrogen 214.7 mg/dL, serum creatinine 30.2 mg/dL) and was treated with emergency
hemodialysis. On the 4th hospital day, a sudden onset of pulmonary hemorrhage developed. The circulating level of anti-glomerular basement
membrane antibody was then elevated highly, and the kidney biopsy showed crescentic glomerulonephritis and linear deposition of IgG along
the glomerular capillary. The patient was treated with intravenous high dose-steroid, oral cyclophosphamide and plasma exchanges. The
pulmonary hemorrhage improved with the therapy, however, his renal function did not improve. He is currently on a regular schedule of
hemodialysis.
