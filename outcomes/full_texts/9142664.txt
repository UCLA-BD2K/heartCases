Secondary penile cancers are rarely seen and most of them are originated from genitourinary and gastrointestinal tract. But metastatic
penile cancer originated from pancreas are extremely rare and two cases have been reported in the literature, only one of them was
pathological proven in autopsy. We report a case of secondary penile carcinoma originated from the pancreas as the primary site which was
pathologically proven.
