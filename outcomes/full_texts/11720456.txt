4 patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with docetaxel developed life-threatening pneumonitis requiring
mechanical ventilation. Docetaxel (30–60 mg m−2, according to a different protocol) was infused within one hour with standard
premedications. One patient's pneumonitis occurred 5 days after the first dose of docetaxel, and that of the other 3 between the 2nd and 6th
cycles. Based on the clinical course, radiological findings of an interstitial pneumonitis, and exclusion of other possible resultant
causes, including metastatic cancer, radiation pulmonary injury, infection, or connective tissue disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis was
diagnosed. The patients were treated with hydrocortisone at 1200 mg per day or methylprednisolone at 240 mg per day. Although 3 of the 4 had
a partial improvement in lung oxygenation, all patients’ conditions of hypersensitivity pneumonitis persisted and were complicated by other
events, such as hospital-acquired infection and tension pneumothorax. The presence of this unusual hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which was
so severe as to be life-threatening and refractory to high-dose corticosteroid therapy, should be taken into account during docetaxel
treatment. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign
