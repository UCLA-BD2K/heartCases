The patient, a 28-year-old man who had presented to our Emergency Department (ED) with constant abdominal pain and distension for one day,
had no previous medical or surgical history. He denied that he had any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. At admission, his
physical examination revealed hypertension (TA: 152/97 mmHg) and a distended abdomen with generalised tenderness and hypoactive bowel
sounds. There was no fever, abdominal guarding, rebound or rigidity. Laboratory results were within normal limits. A plain radiograph of the
abdomen revealed a “coffee bean” sign. We also observed an impressive picture of a typical “whirl” sign and a “bird's beak” sign on an
emergent abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan. Also, his CT scan revealed marked distension and a twisted loop of sigmoid colon. Sigmoid
volvulus (SV) was diagnosed rapidly with these characteristic radiological signs. Subsequently, with flexible sigmoidoscopy, the patient was
successfully decompressed and detorsioned. SV is potentially life-threatening and requires emergency intervention. It is the third leading
cause of colon obstruction in adults after cancer and diverticulitis. The primary emergency therapy for uncomplicated SV is endoscopic
detorsion and decompression. Emergency physicians in particular should be aware of the typical radiographic CT signs, “coffee bean,” “whirl”
and “bird's beak,” which are indicative of SV and which will allow them to easily diagnose this condition in cases of acute abdominal
obstruction. If emergency physicians delay diagnosis, the patients might require emergency surgical intervention. Coffee bean sign (A),
