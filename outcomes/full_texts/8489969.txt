treated with papillocholedochectomy, which entails removal of the papilla of Vater and the whole length of the common bile duct. The
neoplasm is dissected out through the plane between the duodenal circular and longitudinal muscles, deep to the sphincter of Oddi and the
fibromuscular layer of the bile duct. Pathological examination showed that cancer was confined to the mucosal layer without stromal
invasion, and that the operation achieved radical cure. For mucosal cancer, papillo-choledochectomy is an alternative to
pancreatoduodenectomy, provided that repeated frozen-section studies confirm the completeness of excision.
