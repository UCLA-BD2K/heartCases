Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) appears to develop in association with kidney transplantation, but unlikely with dialysis. We report two cases of
classic KS that occurred in patients receiving short-term (less than 3 yr) dialysis. They have been suffering from chronic renal failure due
to tuberculosis and diabetes mellitus, respectively. Several to multiple, reddened-violaceous patches, plaques and nodules were found on the
hand and the lower extremities. Laboratory studies showed no evidence suggesting immunosuppressed state and there was no history of taking
immunosuppressive agents. The biopsies of the two cases revealed proliferation of spindle-shaped cells focally arranged in bundles and
multiple dilated vascular spaces outlined by an attenuated endothelium with intravascular and extravasated erythrocytes. The specimens
expressed positivity with CD34 antigen. Human herpesvirus 8 (Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus) was detected in one case by polymerase
chain reaction method.
