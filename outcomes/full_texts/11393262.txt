A patient presented with deep venous thrombosis and an elevated CA-125 level, but normal pelvic ultrasound and abdominal and pelvic CT
scans. Laparoscopy revealed diffuse carcinomatosis and a diagnosis of stage IIIc, poorly differentiated epithelial ovarian carcinoma was
made. Laparoscopy may provide an alternative means of diagnosis when conventional imaging fails, and may facilitate the placement of
catheters for subsequent intraperitoneal therapy.
