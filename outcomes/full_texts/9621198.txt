After an apparently new virus in the family Paramyxoviridae was isolated from pigs in August 1997, an investigation was carried out to
assess its risk for humans. More than 250 persons with potential exposure to infected pigs were tested serologically. Two piggery workers
with intense occupational exposure had high convalescent-phase antibody titers to this new virus. In early June 1997, both workers had an
influenzalike illness with rash; serologic testing showed no alternative cause. Strong evidence indicates that the two men became ill from
this new virus, but the mode of transmission from pigs to humans remains unknown.
