presentation is reported. High output bile drainage persisted after ultrasound guided percutaneous catheter drainage because of a
preexisting communication of the abscess with the right hepatic ductal system. The abscess was managed successfully by surgical evacuation
and internal drainage into a defunctioned jejunal loop.
