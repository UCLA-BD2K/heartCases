Spontaneous rupture of the spleen is a rare complication of infectious mononucleosis (IM) occurring in 0.1-0.5 percent of patients with
proven IM . Although splenectomy has been advocated as the definitive therapy in the past, numerous recent reports have documented favorable
outcomes with non-operative management. A review of the literature suggests that non-operative management can be successful if appropriate
criteria, such as hemodynamic stability and transfusion requirements are applied in patient selection. We report the case of a 36 year old
man with infectious mononucleosis who had a spontaneous splenic rupture and who was successfully managed by splenectomy. Based on review of
the literature, an approach to management of a spontaneously ruptured spleen secondary to IM is suggested.
