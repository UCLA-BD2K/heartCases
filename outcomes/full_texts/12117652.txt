Diagnosing an environmental or occupationally related pulmonary disorder often involves a process of elimination. Unlike commonly diagnosed
conditions in other specialties, a cause-and-effect relationship may be implied, yet other factors such as temporality and biologic
plausibility are lacking. Our patient was referred with a suspected work-related pulmonary disorder. For several years, she had suffered
with dyspnea on exertion and repeated flulike illnesses. She worked at an automobile repair garage that performed a large number of emission
tests, and there was concern that her workplace exposures were the cause of her symptoms. After a careful review of her history, physical
examination, and laboratory testing, we came to the conclusion that she had hypersensitivity pneumonitis related to pet cockatiels in her
home. Clinical points of emphasis include the importance of a complete environmental history and careful auscultation of the chest when
performing the physical examination. In addition, we encountered an interesting physical diagnostic clue, a respiratory sound that assisted
with the eventual diagnosis.
