Cysticercosis is a common parasitic infection caused by encysted larvae of the helminth Taenia solium (pork tapeworm). The central nervous
system (CNS) is the most important primary site of infection and the disease can present with solitary or multiple space occupying lesions.
Less common presentations in the CNS include the racemose variety with macroscopic groups of cysticerci in the subarachnoid space giving the
appearance of a cluster of grapes and basal or ventricular cysticercosis causing obstructive hydrocephalus. Involvement of other organs:
skeletal muscle, eyes, myocardium and the lungs has also been reported. Cases of cysticercosis presenting as isolated muscle mass
(pseudotumours) without involvement of the CNS have also been recently described in the literature. We present a case of a 43-year-old woman
who complained of subacute onset of left temporal pain and headache. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed characteristic imaging findings
suggestive of cysticercosis of the temporalis muscle.
