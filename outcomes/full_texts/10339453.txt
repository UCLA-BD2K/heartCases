Occasionally children are the victims of mass poisoning from an environmental contaminant that occurs due to an unexpected common point
source of exposure. In many cases the contaminant is a widely used chemical generally considered to be safe. In the following case, members
of a sports team visiting a community for an athletic event were exposed to chemicals while staying at a local motel. Bromine-based
sanitizing agents and other chemicals such as hydrochloric acid, which were used in excess in the motel's swimming pool, may have accounted
for symptoms experienced by the boy reported here and at least 16 other adolescents. Samples of pool water contained excess bromine (8.2
microg/mL; ideal pool bromine concentration is 2-4 microg/mL). Symptoms and signs attributable to bromine toxicity included irritative skin
rashes; eye, nose, and throat irritation; bronchospasm; reduced exercise tolerance; fatigue; headache; gastrointestinal disturbances; and
myalgias. While most of the victims recovered within a few days, the index case and several other adolescents had persistent or recurrent
symptoms lasting weeks to months after the exposure.
