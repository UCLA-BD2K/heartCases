inferior vena cava thrombosis (IVCT) after blunt hepatic trauma. The IVCT was incidentally detected by computed tomography (CT) 35 days
after deep parenchymal suturing and suture approximation for liver lacerations. The patient denied any symptoms of thrombophlebitis.
However, he had presented with significantly elevated values of FDP-D-dimer and a modest increase in plasminogen concentration, which
indicated that he had been in a hypercoagulable and hypofibrinolytic state after the operation. He had not undergone any prophylactic
anticoagulant therapy because of his concomitant subarachnoid hemorrhage and huge hepatic hematoma. The patient was treated with an emercy
thrombectomy. Posttraumatic IVCT is extremely rare phenomenon. We should consider IVCT in patients with a severe hepatic injury,
particularly if their coagulation system change into hypercoagulable and hypofibrinolytic state. Additionally, this case made us reflect on
the treatment of traumatic liver injury.
