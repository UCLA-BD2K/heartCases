A 67-year-old man presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and groin bruising. He had no history of any disease or drug
use. In his breaf story he had a heavy cough five days ago and bruises appeared on the abdomen skin and groin in the last two days.
Ecchymosis extends in the midline from umblicus to the penis and scrotum in physical examination (Figure 1). Laboratory evaluation revealed
normal hemoglobin level, platelet count, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time. Abdominal rectus muscle hematoma was
detected on abdomen computed tomography (Figure 2). We thought that rectus sheath hematoma appeared after heavy coughing. The patient was
given a supportive treatment and after twenty days of follow up, the hematoma was disappered without any complications. Heavy cough can
cause rectus sheath hematoma.1 Rectus sheath hematoma should be considered in elderly patients on anticoagulant treatment with abdominal
pain.2 The frequent clinical findings are abdominal mass and pain.1–3 The patients should be followed up for loss of blood and enlargement
of the hematoma. Fatal complications are rarely seen and supportive treatment is adequate. Supervising Section Editor: Sean O. Henderson, MD
