A 61-yr-old male patient presented with severe chest pain with cardiogenic shock due to an extensive anterolateral myocardial infarction.
Two-dimensional echocardiogram showed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction=17%). Emergent coronary angiogram
obtained immediately after placing temporary pacing electrode revealed total thrombotic occlusion in the left main stem. We performed direct
coronary intervention using kissing balloon technique with the aid of Abciximab (ReoPro) infusion. Residual stenosis with thrombus remained
even after high pressure balloon dilatations, therefore we placed two stents, one in the ostia of left anterior descending (LAD) and the
other in left circumflex artery (LCX). Coronary angiogram after kissing stents showed improved LAD and LCX flows without residual stenosis.
Chest pain resolved and blood pressure normalized after coronary intervention. The whole procedure time was 15 min. Follow-up coronary
angiogram taken one week later showed patent previous stented arteries, and echocardiography demonstrated 40% of left ventricular ejection
fraction. The clinical course for one-year follow-up was uneventful.
