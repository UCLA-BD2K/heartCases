with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (Kasabach-Merritt syndrome) which was cured by orthotopic liver transplant. A 47 year old man
presented with bleeding and tender massive hepatomegaly after tooth extraction. Investigations showed disseminated intravascular
coagulopathy and a giant hepatic haemangioma involving both lobes of the liver. Initial treatment failed to resolve the coagulopathy and
liver resection was attempted. At laparotomy the turnout was unresectable and the only option for cure was to offer a liver transplantation.
The orthotopic liver transplant was performed 20 days after initial laparotomy. Subsequently, all coagulation parameters returned to normal
and the patient remains well after 12 months. Orthotopic liver transplant can be considered for giant hepatic haemangioma with Kasabach-
Merritt syndrome when resection is necessary and a partial hepatectomy is not technically feasible.
