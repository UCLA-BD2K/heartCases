A 42-year-old female diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis was found to have multiple polyps in the fundus of stomach. On histologic
examination, the lesions were hamartomatous polyps. In tuberous sclerosis, many lesions occur in multiple organs and there are several
reports about the frequent association of hamartomatous polyps of the colon. However, gastric manifestation of tuberous sclerosis has not
been established probably due to its asymptomatic nature. This is the first report of multiple gastric hamartomatous polyposis in patient
with tuberous sclerosis.
