A 23 year-old-woman was referred to point out for pain on the left side of her face and mucopurulent rhinorrhoea lasting for 07 months with
long history of recurrent sinusitis. Antibiotics and pain-killers were prescribed to him in the first time. On examination of the oral
cavity, all the permanent teeth were present. At nasal endoscopic examination we found a mucopus trickling from the left middle
meatus.clinical diagnosis is for sinusitis of dental origin, fungal sinusitis or chronic rhinosinusitis Coronal computed tomography (CT) of
the paranasal sinuses revealed the presence of a supernumerary molar tooth (Arrow) within left maxillary sinus floor (A). The tooth was
extracted by traditional approach (Caldwell-Luc procedure) from the maxillary sinus under general anesthesia (B, C, D), and the patient has
been asymptomatic for more than 02 years. The presence of ectopic or supernumerary tooth in the maxillary sinus is most often asymptomatic
but on rare occasions can be a cause of recurrent sinusitis. The supernumerary ectopic tooth is a very rare condition, usually it's
localized on the maxillary sinus, and other sites were described like nasal cavity or chin. Coronal computed tomography is sufficient to
determine extract localization. The extraction can be made by conventional approach or by transnasal endoscopic approach with less
morbidity. A): A coronal computed tomography (CT) of the paranasal sinuses in bone window revealing a filling of the left maxillary sinus
byanhyperdense process attached to the outer wall: ectopic tooth; B): An operative view demonstrated the presence of an ectopic and
supernumerary tooth in the maxillary sinus after incision according to Caldwell-Luc procedure; C): An operative view showing the extraction
of the toothon the maxillary sinus; D): The extracted supernumeraryand ectopic tooth
