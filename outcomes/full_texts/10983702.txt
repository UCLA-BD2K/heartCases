Following improvements in therapy for childhood malignancies, the striking increase in survival rate over the past 30 years has led to the
increase risk of developing second malignant neoplasms (SMNs). We report a case of colorectal carcinoma as a SMN, following treatment for
rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma of the urinary bladder at his age of three years, and developed
adenocarcinoma in the colon 13 years later. Histologic examination of the surgical specimen revealed adenocarcinoma involving the
rectosigmoid area with radiation colitis in its background. The tumor cells showed strong immunoreactivity for p53 protein, suggesting the
role of irradiation and p53 mutation in carcinogenesis. This case emphasizes the need for dose observation in survivors of early childhood
malignancies treated with radiation and multiagent chemotherapy.
