Haff disease, identified in Europe in 1924, is unexplained rhabdomyolysis in a person who ate fish in the 24 hours before onset of illness.
We describe a series of six U.S. patients from 1997 and report new epidemiologic and etiologic aspects. Although Haff disease is
traditionally an epidemic foodborne illness, these six cases occurred in two clusters and as one sporadic case.
