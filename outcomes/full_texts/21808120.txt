A 9-year-old boy presented with 2-year history of progressive discoloration of the lips and fingernails. The boy was a product of a
nonconsanguineous marriage and was born at term with normal developmental milestones. There was no history of discoloration of any other
areas, jaundice, breathlessness, easy fatigue, squatting spells or recurrent chest infections. The parents complained that the boy was
always teased by the fellow students for applying lipstick (Figure 1). They denied any similar complaints by family members. The patient
gave a history of dryness of the eyes since the age of 3 years and use of moisturizing eye drops. Examination revealed a height of 143 cm
(75th centile); weight, 29 kg (50th centile); blood pressure, supine 100/60 and standing 90/58 mm Hg; and hyperpigmentation of the lips,
finger and toenails. The rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable. Hyperpigmentation of lips. What is the diagnosis?
