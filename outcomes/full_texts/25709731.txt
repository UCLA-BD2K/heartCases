A 27 years old woman without medical or surgical records, consults for a bilateral low vision since her childhood, the exam found a visual
acuity of 3/10 on the right and left eye. The slit lamp exam found a bilateral cataract. After a dilatation with tropicamid; we discovered a
superior-temporal lens dislocation in both eyes. The three major etiologies of non traumatic lens dislocation with or without a cataract
are: Marfan syndrome, Weill Marchesani syndrome and Homocystinury. The Marfan syndrome is the most frequent and represents 40% of all
congenital lens dislocation. It's a general disease that affects the metabolism of the collagen of all the body that is weak. This can
manifest with lens dislocation in young patient generally in superior and temporal side due of the weakness of the zonula that brokes. It
can be accompanied with physical abnormalities like tallness; hail members and ligamentar over laxity. Cardiovascular associated
abnormalities like aortal aneurysm represents the major danger of this disease because it can evolve to an aortic dissection of and lead to
sudden death. In our case, the length of our patient was 172 cm. The cardiovascular exam didn't show any abnormalities. The patient went
under surgery and benefit from a phacophagia of both cataracts. A) right eye showing the cataract dislocation and the zonular rupture (white
