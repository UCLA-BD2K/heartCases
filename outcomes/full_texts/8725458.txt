associated with tumors of liver, bile ducts and pancreas. We report two cases, one with gastric leiomyosarcoma and another with Non
Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma, complicated by portal vein block and presenting with gastric variceal bleeding. Portal vein block in both cases was due
to direct vascular infiltration. Development of portal hypertension posed difficulties in management.
