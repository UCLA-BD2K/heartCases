pancreas is controversial. Surgical treatment with pancreatic resection or trancystic arterial ligation is not always satisfactory since
postoperative mortality rate is high, especially for lesions located in the pancreatic head and rebleeding is not unusual. Two patients with
bleeding pseudoaneurysms (one post traumatic, one spontaneous) and one with a hemorrhagic pseudocyst of the pancreatic head were treated
surgically with arterial suture and omentoplasty. Bleeding was controlled in all, without any postoperative mortality or morbidity. No
rebleeding occurred with a follow up of 33, 26 and 12 months. Trancystic ligation of bleeding vessels with omentoplasty may be a useful
approach, which should be compared to arterial embolization in the future.
