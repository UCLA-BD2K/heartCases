The establishment of a new prostate cell line (BM1604) from a human prostatic adenocarcinoma is reported. The line was rapidly established
by culture of tissue on an extracellular matrix, previously laid down by culture of non-related cells. The method has been shown to work
well, and other prostate lines have recently been cultured in this way. The cells have a doubling time of 28 h. DNA fingerprinting
comparison of the genome from the tumour, the germline and the cells shows that somatic mutations have occurred in the tumour and that
clonal selection has clearly occurred in establishment of the line. Many somatic mutations are apparent in the selected cells, which are now
stable in culture. This method and the cells may be a useful addition to the limited material available for the in vitro study of prostate
cells.
