One case of arthritis complicating leukemia is described in which leukemic cells were identified in synovial fluid by light microscopy.
Although arthritis is a well-known manifestation of leukemia with an incidence of 13.5%, the pathogenesis often is unclear, and the direct
demonstration of leukemic cells in synovial fluid has been very uncommon. A 16 year-old male patient was admitted due to left elbow joint
pain and swelling. Synovial fluid examination revealed blast cells and this finding has directed to a final diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic
leukemia.
