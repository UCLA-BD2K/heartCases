The syndrome of transient Headache and Neurological Deficits with cerebrospinal fluid Lymphocytosis (HaNDL) now referred to in the IHS
ICHD–II code 7.8, is only infrequently accompanied by a confusional state and severe agitation. We report the case of a 34–year–old man who
suffered from three episodes of headache with transient focal neurological deficits that were consistent with HaNDL but that were
accompanied by an intense, confusional agitated state that required admission, in the first episode, in a psychiatric unit.
