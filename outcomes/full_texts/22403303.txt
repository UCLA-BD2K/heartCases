A 60-year-old male presented with a 2-week history of fever, jaundice, and altered mental status. Three months ago, he spent 30 days in the
Peruvian Andes and reported insect bites. The physical examination revealed a severely ill patient with marked pallor on the skin and mucous
membranes, jaundice, fever, and hypotension. The liver was felt 4 cm below the right costal margin; the patient was somnolent and
disoriented but no focal or meningeal signs were found. The hemoglobin was 5.8 g/dL; total bilirubin was 13.9 mg/dL with conjugated
bilirubin of 8.2 mg/dL, and the reticulocyte count was 8%. Blood films were negative for malaria, but more than 95% of them contained small
pleomorphic coccobacillus (Figure 1). A 10-day course of ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone was given with full recovery. Wright’s stain of a
peripheral blood smear showing massive infection of red blood cells with coco-bacillary structures compatible with Bartonella bacilliformis
(arrow). Acute bartonellosis caused by Bartonella bacilliformis1 or Bartonella rochalimae,2 also called Carrion’s disease, named after the
Peruvian medical hero Daniel Carrion, is endemic in certain areas of the Andes regions of Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. The disease is
transmitted by sandflies of the genus Lutzomyia. Severe anemia resulting from hemolysis is the hallmark of the acute phase. Prompt
initiation of antibiotic treatment reduces the high mortality rate associated with this disease. Authors’ addresses: Carlos Seas and Ciro
