We report a 61-year-old right-handed man developing disturbance of memory after a discrete thalamic infarction. Neuropsychological
assessment revealed deficits in memory with retrograde and anterograde components, especially for verbal material. Brain MRI showed a left
anterior thalamic infarction with normal angiographic findings. Despite the small lesion in the thalamus, he showed prolonged memory
disturbance and a Brain SPECT image revealed decreased uptake in the ipsilateral fronto-temporo-parietal cortex and contralateral
cerebellum. This diaschisis, a phenomenon caused by disconnection of the neural pathway helped us to evaluate the functional state of the
patient and this imaging technique was valuable for obtaining to get more information for the evaluation of the neurological state and
neuronal connections. In conclusion our findings correspond well with the understanding of amnesia as a disconnection syndrome because of
the evidence of diaschisis on the Brain SPECT image.
