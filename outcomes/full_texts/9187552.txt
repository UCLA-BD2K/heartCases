cyst is a rare entity of a primary liver tumor with an unfavourable prognosis. We report a case of a patient with a cyst in the right lobe
leading to upper abdominal symptoms and respiratory discomfort. Malignancy was not suspected from the clinical findings or repeated
cytological examination of the cyst fluid. However, the blood stained brown color of the cyst fluid was unusual. Cyst recurrence after six
attempts of conservative treatment with sonography guided drainage over a period for more than one year led to laparotomy with cyst
unroofing. Because frozen section from the cyst wall revealed the unexpected finding of squamous cell carcinoma right hemihepatectomy was
performed during the same operation. The patient is alive more than four years after surgery without cyst or tumor recurrence. The
difficulties in establishing diagnosis are confirmed by the review ofother reports. In the diagnosis and treatment ofsymptomatic non-
parasitic liver cysts possible malignancy has to be considered. In case of proven carcinoma radical surgery with partial hepatectomy should
be performed.
