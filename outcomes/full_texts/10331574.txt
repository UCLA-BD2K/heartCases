Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) is an intraepithelial neoplastic disorder which is included as a rare malignant condition. However, it
sometimes shows aggressive behavior of local recurrence and coexisting malignancy. We had experienced nine cases of EMPD involving the
scrotum for seven years. Two cases of them presented metastasis. The first case presented extensive inguinal lymph node metastasis with
underlying adnexal adenocarcinoma one year after wide local excision. The second case initially presented multiple metastasis to the liver
and in the lymph node. The latter, showing fulminant progression with liver metastasis, may be only the second case reported in English
literature. EMPD is considered as a malignant neoplasm with aggressive behavior from initial presentation. Because wide local excision of
the lesion alone may be occasionally insufficient, a careful follow-up must be done to detect recurrence or internal malignancy.
