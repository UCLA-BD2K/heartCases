We report an unusual case of extralobar pulmonary sequestration (ELS) with an associated cyst of mixed bronchogenic and esophageal type. A
58-year-old woman was incidentally found to have a 6 x 6 x 5 cm sized mass in the right superior mediastinum. The mass consisted of
sequestrated pulmonary tissue and an unilocular cyst with a direct communication. The cyst could not be easily classified because it was
lined by squamous or respiratory epithelium with two distinct muscle layers and bronchial glands. Bronchial cartilage was present in close
proximity to the ELS. This unusual combination of ELS with a foregut cyst might be a part of bronchopulmonary foregut malformation,
attributed to a common embryologic pathogenesis.
