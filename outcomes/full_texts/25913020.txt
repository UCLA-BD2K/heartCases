In a 5-year-old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), febrile neutropenia occurred in the induction phase of chemotherapy. She was
not using a central venous catheter. Despite empiric antibiotics, she developed tachypnea, bilateral rales, and disseminated intravascular
coagulation (DIC). Viral, bacterial, and fungal investigations were unremarkable. Thorax and abdominal computed tomography showed bilateral
consolidation areas in the lungs and multiple infarcts in the left lower lobe of the lungs, the liver, the spleen, the kidneys, and the
intestines (Figure 1). Heparin infusion was started. No inherited prothrombotic defect could be shown; antiphospholipid antibodies were
negative. She died of pulmonary failure. Sepsis secondary to an unknown pathogen is the most common cause of mortality and the overall risk
of symptomatic thrombosis is 5.2% in ALL . Despite a high incidence of central nervous system and upper venous system events, widespread
thromboembolism seems to be rare . Our patient had multiple acquired risk factors, such as leukemia, concurrent administration of
Escherichia coli asparaginase and prednisone, infection, and DIC. After administration of anticoagulant therapy, patients usually show
improvement, but in our patient we could not reduce the occlusive events. This case is a good reminder for hematologists that the onset of
neutropenic fever may be very aggressive and thrombotic events may occur rapidly and may be fulminant in children with ALL. Concept: Eda
