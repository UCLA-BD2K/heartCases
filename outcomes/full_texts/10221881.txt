Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) in workers exposed to metal removal fluids (MRFs) is increasing. This study supports the hypothesis that
aerosolized mycobacteria colonizing the MRFs likely cause the disease. Three case studies of HP outbreaks among metal workers showed
potentially high exposures to a rare and newly proposed Mycobacterium species. Retrospective review of samples submitted to our laboratory
showed an association between presence of mycobacteria and HP.
