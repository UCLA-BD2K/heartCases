Illustrative images from a patient with a large right ventricular mass secondary to cardiac sarcoidosis primarily involving the right
ventricle (RV). A 33-year-old male was referred for assessment after presenting with a 10-day history of dyspnoea on exertion with
associated dizziness and was found to be in complete heart block with a ventricular escape rhythm. Endomyocardial biopsy demonstrated non-
caseating granulomata suggestive of sarcoidosis. Advanced imaging modalities including 18FDG PET and MRI imaging demonstrated not only the
extent of cardiac involvement but additionally, active cardiac and non-cardiac active inflammation. This is the first case to demonstrate an
RV tissue mass due to extensive sarcoid involvement with corroborating evidence on 18FDG PET and MRI imaging. Panel A: Transthoracic
Echocardiogram with an apical four-chamber view showing marked right ventricular free wall and apical thickening. Panel B: Cardiac MRI (4CH
Fiesta gated) demonstrating an ovoid mass-like area of soft tissue thickening involving the mid RV-free wall measuring 5 × 1.7 cm. Panel C:
18FDG PET scan using the cardiac sarcoidosis protocol demonstrating a high degree of uptake within the mass lesion and adjacent right
ventricular wall. Left ventricular involvement was most prominent in the interventricular septum with mild FDG uptake within the
anterolateral wall. Panel D: Transoesophageal echocardiogram with midoesophageal four-chamber view at 0° (post 6 months of steroid
treatment) demonstrating significant lessening in the degree of thickening at RV apex. Funding to pay the Open Access publication charges
for this article was provided by Dr Gerald Wisenberg. Supplementary material is available at European Heart Journal online.
