In fall 2010, a 63-year-old man was admitted to Wonkwang University Hospital with a 1-week history of fever and chills, and a rash over his
entire body. He was fond of mountain climbing and occasionally rested on the ground while climbing mountains. At the time of admission, he
appeared acutely ill, with a body temperature of 38.6â„ƒ. On physical examination, the cervical lymph nodes were tender. The patient had two
different types of skin rash: erythematous maculopapules over the entire body except the face and painless erythematous, crusted papules on
the face (Fig. 1). He was suspected of having scrub typhus, and empirical antibiotic treatment with doxycycline was initiated. After 2 days
of treatment, his symptoms began to improve. On the 5th day, the rash on the face became the typical eschars (Fig. 2). The antibody titer
against Orientia tsutsugamushi, detected using an indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay, was 1:2560. After 2 weeks of treatment, the
eschars fell off, but postinflammatory hyperpigmentation remained. After 45 days, the patient's skin lesions had disappeared. A previous
study reported that eschars occurred in 46-92% of scrub typhus patients in Korea. Moreover, almost all of the patients had the typical
single eschar, which was usually found on the chest above the umbilicus. We encountered a patient with scrub typhus who had an unusually
large number of eschars on the face. No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported. Numerous erythematous crusted
papules are observed on the face. The papules became typical eschars on the 5th day after admission.
