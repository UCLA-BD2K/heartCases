Ehlers–Danlos syndrome is a rare inherited illness, which includes an autosomal dominant and also a recessive X–linked variant. Its main
clinical characteristic is a generalised connective tissue involving collagen and elastin, causing fragile and hyperextensible skin, loose
jointedness and bruising. Many clinical subtypes are described, each of a different severity degree pattern. The correlation of this
syndrome and headache disorders is rare. In this paper we describe the case of a young woman with Type II (less severe) Ehlers–Danlos
Syndrome and headache.
