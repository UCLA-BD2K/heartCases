A 26 year old man, with no specific past or family history, presented with slow growing subcutaneous mass in the right parietal region of
about 4 cm. Skin examination revealed a firm subcutaneous nodule that was movable over the underlying bone. Physical examination was not
remarkable other than above-described skin lesion. X-rays of the skull (A) and CT scan (B) showed a subcutaneous mass next to the right
parietal eminence measuring 17×39 mm and containing calcifications. Surgery resection of the tumor was complete and easy (C). The nodule was
not attached to underlying skull. The postoperative course was unremarkable. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of soft-tissue
chondroma (D). Extraskeletal chondroma is a rare, benign cartilaginous tumor of the soft tissue. It presents as a solitary subcutaneous mass
measuring less than 3 cm in diameter that is usually painless and slowly growing. It is most frequently found in the hands and feet of
adults in the fourth and fifth decades. Its location in the scalp is exceptional and atypical. Complete excision is recommended for the
treatment of extra skeletal chondroma. (A) X-rays of the skull showing a subcutaneous tumor in the right parietal region containing
calcifications; (B) CT scan showing a nodule of the scalp of about 17×39 mm containing calcifications and without contrast enhancement after
injection; (C) the nodule after full excision; (D) the histopathologic study shows a limited cartilage tissue containing mature chondocytes
islets. There was no mitosis or atypia
