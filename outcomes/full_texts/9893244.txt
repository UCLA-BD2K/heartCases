presistent bile leak from an aberrant bile duct is presented. The persistence and volume of bile leak resulted in subsequent investigation
of the biliary tree which demonstrated a cholangiocarcinoma of the right hepatic duct. This case is presented as an unusual presentation of
cholangiocarcinoma and to highlight the value of modern techniques in imaging the biliary tree.
