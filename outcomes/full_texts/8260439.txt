of the intrahepatic bile ducts. In 7% of casea a malignant tumor develops complicating the course of the disease. We report the case of a 25
year-old woman in whom Caroli's disease was diagnosed at the age of 11. From that time on, she had several episodes of cholangitis. In 1989,
the abdominal ultrasound and CT scan showed dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, intracystic lithiasis and a solid mass. FNA cytology
showed a papillary adenocarcinoma. At laparotomy a tumor was found occupying both hepatic lobes, and intraoperative US showed another two
nodules in the left lobe. The tumor was considered unresectable. Examination of the hilar lymph nodes was tumor-negative. Two weeks later,
the patient underwent an ortothopic liver transplantation (OLT). The pathological examination confirmed Caroli's disease with
adenocarcinoma. Two years after OLT, the patient is alive with normal liver function and no evidence of disease. To our knowledge this is
the first case report of adenocarcinoma in Caroli's disease treated by OLT.
