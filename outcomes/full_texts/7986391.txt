We report two cases of posttransplant malignant lymphoma(PTML) of B cell origin associated with Epstein-Barr virus(EBV) infection. They were
a 52-year-old male and a 37 year-old-female, in whom intermediate-grade diffuse malignant lymphomas of large cell type developed in the
submandibular area and jejunum, respectively. DNA and RNA in situ hybridization revealed the presence of EBV-specific DNA and RNA sequences
in the tumor cells.
