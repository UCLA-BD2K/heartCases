Acute renal failure (ARF) is a relatively frequent complication associated with heart transplantation. It develops in the first few days
postoperatively and is characterized by oliguria with laboratory and urinary indices typical of pre-renal azotemia. Cyclosporine, especially
with higher doses, is one of the many factors which play an integral part in the nephrotoxicity following cardiac transplant. Poor
preoperative renal function and perioperative hemodynamic compromise may also contribute to ARF. The actual incidence of ARF now encountered
by transplant centers may be lower than previously reported, the result of lower cyclosporine doses. Currently, management is entirely
supportive, but novel therapeutic approaches with atrial natriuretic peptide-like substances are being explored. A case illustrating the
typical clinical presentation of ARF after heart transplant will be presented and the clinical features will be reviewed.
