A 50-year-old woman presented with a 2-years history of chronic flanc and hematuria. Plain abdominal radiography was performed showing
bilateral complete staghorn calculi. Urinalysis and urine culture revealed a urinary infection by Proteus Morganii. Biologic investigations
did not show any matabolic disorder. The urinary infection was treated by antibiotics and the stone by a combination of percutaneous
nephrolitotomy and open surgery. The infrared spectrometry analysis found a calcium oxalate calculi. A Staghorn calculus is a large renal
stone with irregular branches that can involve the renal pelvis and extend into calyces. Physiopatholgy of staghorn calculi is based on
urinary infection. They are usually seen in the setting of infection with urease producing bacteria. They are composed of struvite
(magnesium ammonium phosphate) but also, they can be composed of calcium oxalate. The majority of staghorn calculi are symptomatic: urinary
infection, flanc pain, hematuria, urinary symptoms. The diagnosis can be performed by Plain abdominal radiography. Intravenous urography or
CT scans are more helpful by showing the stone and delineating the pelvic calyceal anatomy. The treatment recommended of this type of renal
stone is based on complete removal of all stone material after Sterilization of the urine with antimicrobial treatment. The elimination of
all residual fragments can be obtained by the combinaison of different techniques: percutaneous nephrolitotomy, extracorporeal shockwave
lithotripsy, retrograde ureteroscopic lithotripsy, open surgery. No treated, staghorn stone can cause septicemia, chronic renal
insufficiency, destruction of kidney by infection and chronic calicial dilatation. A) Plain abdominal radiograph: bilateral complete
staghorn calculi; B) A part of staghorn stone extract by open surgery
