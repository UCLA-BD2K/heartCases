We report the case of a patient who developed typical cluster headache attacks and was diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis (MS) at the
same time. The headache attacks resolved after i.v. treatment with methylprednisolone. MR imaging showed a pontine demyelinating lesion
involving the trigeminal nerve root inlet area, on the same side as the pain. The association between cluster headache and MS has been
rarely described before. This case suggests that in patients with cluster headache neuroimaging is often useful in order to exclude
structural lesions.
