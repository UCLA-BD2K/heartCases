Gonadoblastoma and dysgerminoma developed in a 24-year-old phenotypic female patient with 46,XY pure gonadal dysgenesis. This patient
presented with primary amenorrhea. Clinical characteristics showed a typical stigmata of gonadal dysgenesis: primary amenorrhea, sexual
infantilism, a small uterus and bilateral streak gonads. A 46,XY karyotype was made by lymphocyte culture. The patient was counseled to
undergo a prophylactic bilateral gonadectomy, but she refused. Three years and three months after the initial diagnosis she felt a growing
pelvic mass. Bilateral gonadectomy and total hysterectomy were performed. Histological examination revealed gonadoblastoma and dysgerminoma
on both gonads. After surgery the patient received radiation therapy and also was started on hormone replacement therapy. Two years and two
months after treatment by surgery the patient is well and free of recurrence.
