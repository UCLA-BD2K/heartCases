Abdominal cocoon is a rare disease of the peritoneum and almost invariably presents as an acute or subacute intestinal obstruction with or
without a mass. The etiology of this disease is largely unknown and abdominal cocoon of unknown etiology has been limited to the tropical
and subtropical zones and primarily affects young adolescent females. In the temperate zone, only one case has been reported from the United
Kingdom, but the patient was also born in Pakistan. No case of abdominal cocoon purely developed in the temperate zone has been reported.
Recently, we experienced a case of abdominal cocoon in a 34-year-old female patient(Korean) who had never been abroad. The diagnosis was
made postoperatively by reviewing the literature. We herein report this rare condition developed in an unusual geographical location with a
brief review of the literature.
