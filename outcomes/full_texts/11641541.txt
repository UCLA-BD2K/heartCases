Eosinophilic cellulitis (Wells'syndrome) is an uncommon skin disorder. We report two adult male patients who had recurrent erythematous
plaques and a nodular lesion on the abdomen. The histopathologic feature of their skin biopsies similarly indicated a marked infiltrate of
eosinophils in the dermis with the fashion of "flame figures". One of the patients demonstrated blood eosinophilia. Given the
clinicohistological findings, the patients fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of eosinophilic cellulitis. The skin lesions remained
refractory to medications such as corticosteroids, sulfones, antihistamines, and minocycline. Considering the beneficial effect of
cyclosporine in the treatment of eosinophilia-associated dermatoses, we speculated that eosinophilic cellulitis might respond to
cyclosporine therapy. Thus, each of the two patients was given cyclosporine (microemulsion formulation) at a daily dose of 1.25 or 2.5
mg/kg, i.e., 100 or 200 mg, respectively. Complete remission of the skin eruptions was obtained in both patients during a 3- or 4-week
period of treatment. No side effects were observed. Neither of the patients experienced relapse of the disease at least over 10 months after
the discontinuation of the cyclosporine therapy. We suggest that administration of low-dose cyclosporine be a safe and useful therapeutic
option in patients with eosinophilic cellulitis.
