lesions of the head of the pancreas and more rarely ampullary and primary common bile duct lesions. Obstruction due to lesions of the
ampulla of Vater may be due to adenocarcinoma which has a significantly better long term prognosis than carcinomas located in the head of
the pancreas. A case is presented where two tumours were identified at the ampulla of Vater of the resected specimen one an adenocarcinoma
and the other a carcinoid tumour representing a collision tumour.
