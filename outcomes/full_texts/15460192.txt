BACKGROUND: Prior reported cases of stillbirth and neonates infected with enteroviruses suggest transplacental infection. We present a case
of fetal infection with coxsackievirus B3, diagnosed antenatally and resulting in live birth. CASE: A pregnant woman presented at 26 weeks
with fetal tachycardia and non-immune hydrops fetalis. Coxsackievirus B3 was cultured from amniotic fluid. Maternal antibody to
coxsackievirus B3 was positive at 1:512. At 32 weeks, the fetus deteriorated and was delivered. Cord blood antibody to coxsackievirus B3 was
positive at a higher titer. Following neonatal death, brain and placental tissues were positive for enterovirus ribonucleic acid by
polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION: Intrauterine infection by enteroviruses should be considered in the differential diagnosis of non-
immune hydrops fetalis. Antenatal diagnosis of coxsackievirus B3 infection is associated with poor outcome.
