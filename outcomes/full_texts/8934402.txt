We report a case of adamantinoma of the tibia resembling fibrous dysplasia. The patient was a 55-year-old male, and complained of pain in
the right lower leg. Roentgenographs showed a well demarcated osteolytic lesion with small foci of calcification and septation within the
diaphysis of the distal tibia. The cortex was partially disrupted. Histologically, initial biopsy specimen showed fibrous connective tissue
and trabeculae of immature woven bone, strongly suggestive of fibrous dysplasia. The lesion recurred and the second biopsy revealed nests of
spindle cells and tubular epithelial structures embedded in granulation type-fibrous tissue. Immunohistochemically, both the nests of
spindle cells and the tubular structures gave a positive reaction for cytokeratin. The present case emphasizes once again that histological
diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia of the tibia should be made carefully with exclusion of the possibility of adamantinoma.
