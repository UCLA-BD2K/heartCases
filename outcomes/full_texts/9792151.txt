We conducted a retrospective review of fatal bleomycin pulmonary toxicity in patients treated for germ cell tumours during 1991-95 at the
Beatson Oncology Centre, Glasgow. Case notes of patients treated with bleomycin were reviewed with respect to cumulative bleomycin dose,
renal impairment, exposure to supplemental oxygen, thoracic radiotherapy and age. A total of 194 patients underwent chemotherapy, of whom
180 received bleomycin-containing regimens. Five fatal cases of pulmonary toxicity were identified, an incidence of 2.8%. These cases were
older than the remaining patients (P < 0.001), with a median age at diagnosis of 55 vs 33 years. The incidence of fatal pulmonary toxicity
increased with each decade of life above age 30. Renal function also differed between the two groups, with the worst glomerular filtration
rate recorded at the time of bleomycin administration for each patient, lower in the fatal group, median 69 vs 107 ml min(-1) (P < 0.001).
There was no difference with respect to cumulative bleomycin dose or exposure to supplemental oxygen. For patients aged over 40 years,
especially those with renal function in the lower range of normal, the risk of developing fatal toxicity may exceed 10%. The benefits of
bleomycin could be questioned for this age group.
