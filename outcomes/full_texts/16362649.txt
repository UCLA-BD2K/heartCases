Headache, and migraine in particular, is the main neurological reason for consultation. We present the case of a 48–year–old woman who
experienced a transformation of her episodic migraine attacks into daily headache episodes due to the ingestion of biscuits containing wheat
as their main ingredient. This experience emphasises that a good clinical interview remains the most important point in the diagnosis and
management of headache.
