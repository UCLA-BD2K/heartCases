in five patients with multiple metastases from gastric cancer in both hepatic lobes. After gastrectomy with extensive lymph node dissection
(R2/3), all patients underwent implantation of a vascular occluder around the hepatic artery. Cannulation of the hepatic artery was added
for later chemotherapy. The hepatic artery was occluded repeatedly for 1 hour twice daily in combination with intrahepatic infusion of
anticancer drugs for as long as possible. Three of five patients demonstrated marked tumour regression with unexpectedly long survival (16
months in two patients and one still alive at 15 months). Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels decreased to almost normal in four patients
who had initially high levels. The present experiences seems to indicate that long survival can be hoped for in patients with advanced
gastric cancer with unresectable liver metastases.
