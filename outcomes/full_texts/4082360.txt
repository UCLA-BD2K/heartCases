Virus particles similar to Otofuke virus have been found, together with rotaviruses and astroviruses, by electronmicroscopy in faeces from
an infant with diarrhoea in Northern Ireland. Previously Otofuke virus has been found only in Japan whence it may have been carried to this
country by a businessman.
