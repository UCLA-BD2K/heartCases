A 58-year-old man was admitted for coronary angiography after several months of worsening angina. After two failed femoral catheterization
attempts due to guide-wire obstruction, access was achieved through the right brachial artery. Catheterization revealed severe three-vessel
coronary artery disease. An aortogram was performed revealing a complete occlusion of the aorta inferior to the renal arteries. A computed
tomography angiography with runoff demonstrated significant collateral circulation with reconstitution of the distal femoral arteries. (see
image 1)On further history, the patient noted bilateral calf and buttock claudication, erectile dysfunction and a 40-pack year smoking
history. Despite complete aortic occlusion, the patient had 1+ palpable posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses due to extensive
collateralization. (see image 2) Leriche syndrome is the triad of claudication, impotence and decreased pulses due to aortoiliac occlusion.1
Risk factors include hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and smoking. The Ankle Brachial Index is a non-invasive, inexpensive
and reliable method to screen patients.2 Treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms related to aortic occlusion as well as the prevention
of proximal propagation of thrombus. Complete aortic occlusion is treated with open bypass surgery although new endoscopic techniques are on
the horizon.3 Our patient had a successful three vessel CABG followed 2 months later by aortofemoral bypass. His claudication completely
resolved 3 weeks postoperatively. None disclosed. Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons
