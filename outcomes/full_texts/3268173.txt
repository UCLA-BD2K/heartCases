Chloroma is a granulocytic sarcoma with it's characteristic greenish color. Recently there is an increased number of cases that are
apparently aleukemic when the tumor mass is first presented. Recently we experienced a case of granulocytic sarcoma with characteristic
green color (chloroma), which showed no evidence of leukemia in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. This patient presented headache, and
was diagnosed brain tumor on computed tomography. A left parietal cranietomy was done to remove a large central dome-like mass, 8 cm,
involving the dura with a slightly dusky greenish solid appearance. Compact nests of moderately mature granulocytes and immature cells
comprised the tumor. Histochemical and electron microscopic studies confirmed these tumor cells as myeloid cells in varying stages of
maturation. Several days after the operation, left cervical lymph nodes became palpated, and the biopsied lymph nodes revealed same
neoplastic cells seen in the skull. However, bone marrow aspiration, biopsy and peripheral blood smears did not show any evidence of
leukemia.
