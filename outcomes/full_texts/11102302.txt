The advent of magnetic sector inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) allows rapid, accurate, and precise measurement of lead
isotopes in environmental and biological samples at a lower cost than traditional methods. This may increase the feasibility of including
lead isotope measurements as a routine tool to identify household sources of lead exposure to children. Here, we present three household
case studies to illustrate how lead hazard evaluations by an environmental specialist could be supplemented with routine lead isotope
analyses of potential lead sources and blood. Sampling for lead isotopes was undertaken following the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development regulatory guidelines for the evaluation of lead hazards in housing, and with the consideration of minimizing the additional
costs associated with lead isotope measurements. The range of isotopic ratios within a single residence was large enough to allow the
characterization of different lead sources, particularly when both major (e.g., (207)Pb/(206)Pb) and minor (e.g., (206)Pb/(204)Pb) isotope
ratios were considered. These cases illustrate the utility of the lead isotope method to identify main source(s) of lead exposure to the
child; discard unlikely sources of exposure to the child; point to sources of lead to dust; and substantiate or refine the environmental
assessment based exclusively on lead concentrations and loadings. Thus, a more effective evaluation of household lead hazards would likely
benefit from considering a) lead concentrations and loadings in and around the household environment; b) all isotopic ratios of potential
lead sources within that environment; and c) information about behavioral habits, as well as an evaluation of viable pathways of exposure to
the child.
