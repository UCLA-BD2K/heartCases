Aerococcus viridans, a catalase-negative gram-positive coccus rarely causing bacteremia, was isolated from blood cultures of a 52-yr-old man
under the granulocytopenic condition. The isolate showed the typical characteristics of A. viridans, i.e., tetrad arrangements in gram
stain, positive pyrrolidonyl aminopeptidase (PYR) and negative leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) reactions, and no growth at 45 degrees C. The
isolate was revealed to be highly resistant to penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and ceftriaxone, although most strains of A. viridans
isolated from the previously reported patients were susceptible to penicillin and other commonly used antibiotics. Even though A. viridans
is rarely associated with human infections, it could be a potential causative agent of bacteremia, especially in immunocompromised patients.
