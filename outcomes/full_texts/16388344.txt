We describe a woman with a long history of relapsing-remitting painful ophthalmoplegia in a seasonal pattern, due to an isolated orbital
myositis that was—at our observation–classified in the context of the so-called SAPHO syndrome. She had been previously treated with
corticosteroid therapy, but the association with immunosuppressive drugs produced a more prompt resolution of both the headache and
ophthalmoplegia, and of the magnetic resonance imaging pictures of isolated myositis as well.
