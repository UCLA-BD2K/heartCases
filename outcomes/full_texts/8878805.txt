We report a case of glomerular disease with both mesangial IgA and subepithelial IgG deposits in the allograft kidney. The patient was a 36
year-old man who had received a renal allograft 1 year previously. Fifteen days before admission, he discovered a microscopic hematuria
without clinical evidences of allograft rejection. Light microscopy showed diffuse increase of mesangial matrix without mesangial cell
proliferation. Capillary walls were diffusely and mildly thickened. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated both granular deposits of IgA
in the mesangium and IgG along the capillary walls. On electron microscopy, electron-dense deposits were identified not only in the
mesangium but also on the epithelial side of the glomerular basement membrane.
