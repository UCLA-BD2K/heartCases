Carbon disulfide toxicity is well characterized. The principal target organ is the nervous system, although cardiovascular, reproductive,
ophthalmologic, and other effects are also recognized. The neurotoxicity manifests in three ways: encephalopathy, peripheral and cranial
nerve dysfunction, and movement abnormalities. This report describes a case of olivopontocerebellar atrophy, a form of multiple system
atrophy, developing in an adult after over 30 years of occupational exposure to carbon disulfide. The patient presented with the insidious
onset of balance problems, impotence, and irritability, without tremor, cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, or changes in facial expression.
Over the next few years severe ataxia developed, and the clinical diagnosis was confirmed with computed tomography and magnetic resonance
imaging scans. The patient experienced multiple medical complications and died approximately 9 years after diagnosis. This case is
consistent with a large body of clinical and experimental literature, much of it 50 years old, showing that carbon disulfide can cause
movement disorders. It also serves as a reminder that movement disorders, ranging from parkinsonism to dystonia, are associated with a
variety of toxic exposures such as manganese, carbon monoxide, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, and medications.
