Posterior scleritis is a rare cause of ocular pain, due to scleral inflammation, presenting with periocular pain, pain on movement and
decreased vision. Although anterior scleritis may be associated with this condition, ocular signs may be absent. We report a case of
posterior scleritis, presenting with right-sided ocular and periocular pain, exacerbated by ocular movements, irradiating to the ipsilateral
temple and zygoma, not associated with visual disturbances at onset. Diagnosis was made with ultrasonography and confirmed by brain and
orbital MRI. Differential diagnosis of facial pain, in particular, affecting the periorbital region, is discussed. In the presence of ocular
pain, even in the absence of ocular signs, an ophthalmologic consultation should be performed.
