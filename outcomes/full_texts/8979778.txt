Five cases of schistosomiasis have been recorded in the Belfast City Hospital Histopathology Laboratory over the last three years. The sites
of infection have included the colon, bladder, uterus and seminal vesicles. All the infected individuals had visited Africa. Three of them
were health care workers. The clinician must maintain a high index of suspicion when treating those with a history of travel and risk of
exposure to this infection. Diagnosis is made even more critical as the condition is treatable, and serological markers can identify those
with occult infection.
