We describe the characteristic clinical and pathologic findings of three cases of constrictive bronchiolitis. All three patients were
middle-aged women with chronic respiratory illness characterized by chronic cough, dyspnea, mild to severe obstructive pulmonary
dysfunction, relatively normal chest radiographs with occasional peribronchial infiltration, and lack of response to bronchodilators or
prednisolone. The patients also had medical diseases such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and hyperprolactinemia in case 1 and 3, respectively.
None of the patients smoked cigarettes and had clinical evidence of recent viral lower respiratory tract infection. Histologic study by open
lung biopsy revealed a spectrum of changes ranging from active cellular bronchiolitis to obliterative peribronchiolar fibrosis. The
intervening interstitial and alveolar areas showed no remarkable lesion. Immunohistochemically, the bronchiolar or peribronchiolar
inflammatory infiltrates mainly comprised of mixed T- and B-lymphocytes. It may be possible that the active form of constrictive
bronchiolitis is initiated by attendant lymphocytic inflammation of the airways, which is followed by fibrous obliteration of bronchioles.
