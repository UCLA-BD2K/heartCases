A case of telangiectatic focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) was detected at birth and was surgically removed. Grossly, the lesion was a
solitary nodule and showed vague nodularity, appearing as an adenoma-like mass with fine fibrous septa, but having no macroscopic scar. On
microscopic scale, the mass typically had neither fibrous central scar nor hyperplastic nodules different from the usual FNHs. The hepatic
plates were separated by sinusoidal dilatation, sometimes alternating with areas of marked ectasia. Instead of large fibrous scar, thin
fibrous septa were often found, and contained abnormal tortuous large arteries. These high-pressure vessels were connected directly into the
adjacent sinusoids and made marked dilation of sinusoids. Bile ductular proliferation was also noted in the thin fibrous septa. To our
knowledge, this is considered to be the first reported case of telangiectatic FNH detected at birth.
