Colorectal cancer with bone metastasis as initial manifestation is a very rare event. We have reported a case of rectal cancer presenting
with sternal metastasis. A 30 year-old man was evaluated due to pain in the sternal area with a bulging mass. History and physical
examination did not suggest any specific disease. A radionuclide bone scan revealed increased uptake in the sternal area, right 6th rib, and
sacrum. Microscopic examination of a biopsy specimen from the sternum showed metastatic adenocarcinoma. A barium enema and CT scan of the
pelvis suggested carcinoma of the upper rectum. Adenocarcinoma of the rectosigmoid junction area was demonstrated by colonoscopic
examination with biopsy. He received palliative transverse colostomy for obstruction without further treatment.
