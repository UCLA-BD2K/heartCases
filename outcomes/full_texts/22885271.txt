A 50-year-old male presented to the emergency service for evaluation of acute onset abdominal pain. The chest radiograph (Fig. A, white
arrows) and plain radiograph of the abdomen (erect posture) (Fig. B, black arrows) revealed classical multiple cigar-shaped calcified
densities suggestive of subcutaneous cysticercosis. Human cysticercosis develops due to the ingestion of the eggs of Taenia solium;
sometimes autoinfection may occur if individuals harbouring egg-producing tapeworms ingest eggs derived from their own faeces. Surgical
excision is generally limited for histopathological confirmation of the diagnosis. Asymptomatic calcified cysticerci are better left alone.
