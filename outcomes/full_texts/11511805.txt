Amenorrhea is rarely presented as a manifestation of endocrinological disturbances in patients of chronic hydrocephalus. We describe two
cases of secondary amenorrhea caused by hydrocephalus due to aqueductal stenosis. Two female patients of age 30 and 20 yr presented with
amenorrhea and increasing headache. Magnetic resonance images revealed marked, noncommunicating hydrocephalus without any tumorous lesion.
In one patient, emergent extraventricular drainage was necessary because of progressive neurological deterioration. Each patient underwent
surgical intervention for the hydrocephalus-ventriculoperitoneal shunt and endoscopic third ventriculostomy. Both resumed normal
menstruation continuing so far with further normal menstrual bleeding. These two cases and others reported in the literature indicated that
the surgical intervention for hydrocephalus resolves amenorrhea in all the cases of amenorrhea due to hydrocephalus. The suspected role of
the surgery is the correction of increased intracranial pressure, which is an important pathogenetic factor in the development of
amenorrhea.
