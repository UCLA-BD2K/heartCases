Esophageal tubular duplication is a rare congenital anomaly. We experienced a patient with esophageal tubular duplication who presented with
a swallowing difficulty which was aggravated after a gastrofiberscopic examination. Preoperative diagnosis was intramural hematoma of the
esophagus due to trauma caused by endoscopy. Surgical specimen revealed that hematoma was located within a duplicated lumen of the
esophagus. The radiologic and endoscopic findings are discussed in correlation with its pathology.
