Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disease characterized by a gastric mucosal defect which results in an insufficiency of intrinsic factor
to facilitate the absorption of the physiologic amount of cobalamin. Increased risk of cancers of the stomach has been reported for patients
with pernicious anemia. We report here a case of a 65 year old woman who had been diagnosed as having pernicious anemia 16 months
previously, was receiving monthly vitamin B12 injections, and developed early gastric cancer type IIa by routine follow-up gastroscopic
examination. This patient underwent endoscopic mucosal resection for an early gastric cancer lesion with a free resection margin.
