Interstitial pulmonary emphysema is a well-documented complication of assisted mechanical ventilation in premature infants with respiratory
distress syndrome. Localized persistent interstitial pulmonary emphysema (LPIPE) confined to a single lobe was incidentally presented in a
4-day-old female infant. This patient was a normal full-term baby with no respiratory distress symptom and no experience of assisted
mechanical ventilation. Chest radiograph showed radiolucent area in right lower lobe zone, which needed differential diagnosis from other
congenital lesions such as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation and congenital lobar emphysema. CT scan showed irregular-shaped air
cystic spaces and pathologically, cystic walls primarily consisted of compressed lung parenchyma and loose connective tissue intermittently
lined by multinucleated foreign body giant cells.
