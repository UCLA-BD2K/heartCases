The coracoid process is a part of the scapula and plays an important role in shoulder function. The present case demonstrates bilateral
separation of the coracoid processes from the scapular bodies. The cause of this condition was thought to be a failure of fusion of the
ossification centers of the coracoid processes with the scapular bodies. Bilateral unfused coracoid processes was identified incidentally in
a patient with recurrent dislocation in the left shoulder. However, history of antecedent trauma to the coradoid region was not found. It
would be important to distinguish this condition from fracture or nonunion of the coracoid process.
