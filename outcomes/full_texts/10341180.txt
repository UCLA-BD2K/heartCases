The first case of yellow fever in French Guiana since 1902 was reported in March 1998. The yellow fever virus genome was detected in
postmortem liver biopsies by seminested polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis showed that this strain was most closely related to
strains from Brazil and Ecuador.
