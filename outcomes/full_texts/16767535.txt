A 21-year-old Caucasian male presented to an oral medicine clinic with bilateral nuchal to frontal headache that was associated with burning
eyes and lacrimation. Following a string of previous consultations with a variety of specialists, no diagnosis had been made. Treatment was
carried out empirically, with the best improvement experienced when the patient was put on a combination of gabapentin and dothiepin
treatment. This case highlights the importance of multidisciplinary management of headaches, as well as constant revision of the
International Classification of Headache Disorders.
