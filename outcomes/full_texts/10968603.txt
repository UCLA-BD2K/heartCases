We present a case of post-cesarean delivery, nonclostridial endomyometritis in which uterine (myometrial) gas formation raised concern for
myonecrosis and need for hysterectomy. The patient fully recovered without surgery. Myometrial gas formation in this setting and in an
otherwise stable patient may be an insufficient reason for hysterectomy.
