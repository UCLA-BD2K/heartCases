Cowden's disease, or multiple hamartoma syndrome, is an uncommon condition with characteristic mucocutaneous lesions associated with
abnormalities of the breast, thyroid, and gastrointestinal tract. We describe a 32-year-old man with oral mucosal papillomatosis and plantar
hyperkeratosis as a definite case of Cowden's disease according to the criteria proposed by Salem and Steck. The patient also had a thyroid
mass and numerous gastrointestinal polyps endoscopically. Histologically the polyps were hamartomatous or hyperplastic polyps. The oral
papillary lesions were fibroepithelial polyps and the thyroid mass was a follicular adenoma. We review the literature on this entity and
summarize the pertinent findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of Cowden's disease in a Korean.
