The prevalence of antibodies to Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii in coyotes (Canis latrans) in California ranged from 51% in central to
34% in southern and 7% in northern California. Seropositive coyotes were more likely to be from coastal than inland counties (p clustered
distribution of Bartonella seropositivity in coyotes suggests that B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii infection is vectorborne. Further
investigation is warranted to evaluate which arthropods are vectors and what the mode of transmission is from wildlife to domestic dogs and
possibly humans.
