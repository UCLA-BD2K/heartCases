Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease is a disease of the elderly and extremely rare in young individuals. If
young people develop CPPD crystal deposition disease, it may be associated with metabolic diseases such as hemochromatosis,
hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphatasia, hypomagnesemia, Wilson's disease, hypothyroidism, gout, acromegaly, and X-linked hypophosphatemic
rickets. Therefore, in young-onset polyarticular CPPD crystal deposition disease, investigation for predisposing metabolic conditions is
warranted. We report a case of a young male patient with idiopathic CPPD crystal deposition disease, who did not have any evidences of
metabolic diseases after thorough evaluations. As far as we know, this is the first report of a young male patient presented with idiopathic
CPPD crystal deposition disease.
