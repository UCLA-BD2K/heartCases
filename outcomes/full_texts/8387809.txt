needle biopsy of liver neoplasms is rarely reported. We describe two such cases following the needle biopsy of an hepatocellular carcinoma
and secondary colorectal carcinoma respectively. The risk of needle track recurrence of liver tumours should not be regarded as
insignificant. The diagnosis of liver neoplasms may be achieved by non-invasive modalities, and their needle biopsy should be reserved for
cases not amenable to surgical resection.
