A 35-year-old man, a stone driller by occupation, presented to the outpatient clinic of the department of Medicine, Jawaharlal Institute of
Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (Puducherry, India) in December 2013 with a history of fever, body aches, and headache since
last 15 days. He reported no localizing symptoms. There was no icterus or lymphadenopathy. An eschar was noted on the upper abdomen
(Figure). A faint blanching erythema was also apparent on the trunk and proximal limbs. Liver and spleen were palpable two cm below the
costal margins. Except for a mild leucocytosis (11,910 WBCs per μl), his blood counts, renal and liver function tests were normal. An
immunochromatographic test was positive for antibodies to Orientia tsutsugamushi. He was treated with oral doxycycline 100 mg twice a day
for seven days, and the fever subsided on day 3. Clinical photograph showing an erythematous papule (measuring 10×5 mm) on the right upper
quadrant of the abdomen capped by a well-defined blackish scab (Eschar; see inset) and surrounded by a collar of desquamation; hypopigmented
macules of Tinea versicolor are also seen over the chest and shoulders. Scrub typhus is an underappreciated cause of acute febrile illness
in many parts of India12. It is caused by the rickettsial pathogen O. tsutsugamushi, which is transmitted by the bite of larval trombiculid
mites inhabiting scrub vegetation. Often, it results in life-threatening complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, hepato-
renal dysfunction, and meningoencephalitis3. The eschar represents the site of inoculation, where initial multiplication occurs before
widespread dissemination. An eschar is typically painless and non-pruritic, and hence its presence is not reported by patients4. A diligent
search for eschar is often rewarding. It clinches a diagnosis of scrub typhus, enabling early initiation of treatment.
