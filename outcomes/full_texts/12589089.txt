Bartter-like syndrome encompasses a set of inherited renal tubular disorders associated with hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, renal salt
wasting, hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism, and normal blood pressure. Antenatal Bartter syndrome, a subtype of Bartter-like syndrome, is
characterized by polyhydramnios, premature delivery, life-threatening episodes of fever and dehydration during the early weeks of life,
growth retardation, hypercalciuria, and early-onset nephrocalcinosis. Mutations in the bumetanide-sensitive Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2)
and ATP-sensitive inwardly rectifying potassium channel (ROMK) of the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop have been identified in the
antenatal Bartter syndrome. We report the identification of two heterozygous mutations of the gene for Kir 1.1 (ROMK) from an antenatal
Bartter syndrome patient who presented at birth with mild salt wasting and a biochemical findings that mimicked primary
pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1, such as hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, and evolved to a relatively benign course. We have identified amino
acid exchanges Arg338Stop and Met357Thr in the gene exon 5 for ROMK by PCR and direct sequencing. Both mutations alter the C-terminus of the
ROMK protein, and can affect channel function.
