Pulsatile tinnitus is a rarely occurring symptom of vascular origin. Most frequently, the symptoms are due to an arteriovenous malformation,
to a tumor of the jugular glomus or to a local arterial stenosis. A 39-yr-old Korean male suffering from pulsatile tinnitus of the left ear
was diagnosed to have dural arteriovenous malformation of the jugular bulb. Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography revealed a high-
velocity vascular lesion encroaching the internal jugular vein and sigmoid sinuses. Digital subtraction angiography demonstrated a dural
arteriovenous malformation involving the jugular bulb. The arterial supply was from the neuromeningeal branch of the left ascending
pharyngeal artery and inferior tympanic artery. Stenosis of the left jugular vein caused retrograde venous drainage through the
contralateral transverse sinus. Superselective embolization of these feeding arteries was successfully performed using 25% mixture of
N-butylcyanoacrylate and lipiodol. In postembolization period, his complaints of pulsatile tinnitus and buzzing noise behind his left ear
disappeared.
