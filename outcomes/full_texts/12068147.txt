Fetal cystic hygroma is a rare developmental congenital anomaly of the lymphatic system, characterized by the formation of a multilocular,
variable sized cystic mass. Most of cystic hygromas are found in the neck and other rare locations include axilla, mediastinum, and limbs.
There are many papers about cystic hygroma colli, but there are only a few papers about fetal axillary cystic hygroma and no domestic
papers. We present a case of fetal axillary cystic hygroma diagnosed antenatally followed by full-term delivery in a 30-yr-old woman.
Operation was performed on the 8th day after birth and the mass was excised and confirmed as cystic hygroma.
