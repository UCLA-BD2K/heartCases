We report a case of primary fibroepithelial polyp of the right midureter. The patient was a 41-year-old-woman, complaining of right flank
pain. An excretory urogram revealed right hydronephrosis and a filling defect of the the right midureter. The filling defect was produced by
a large fibroepithelial polyp that was diagnosed and removed by ureteroscopy without open surgery. Large fibroepithelial ureteral polyps are
relatively rare and ureteroscopy is the gold standard of diagnosis for ureteral filling defect.
