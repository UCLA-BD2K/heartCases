HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is a clinicopathologic entity characterized by heavy proteinuria, absence of edema and an irreversible
decline in renal function. Findings on renal biopsy include: collapsed glomerular capillaries; visceral glomerular epitheliosis; microcystic
tubules; mesangial prominence; and endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions. Early in the AIDS epidemic, HIVAN was the predominant glomerular
lesion observed in HIV-infected patients. It is being increasingly recognized, especially in Caucasian populations, that a variety of immune
complex-mediated lesions such as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, proliferative glomerulonephritis and IgA nephropathy are
associated with HIV infection. In this review we present two cases: one patient whose first presentation of AIDS was end-stage renal
disease, who on biopsy was found to have HIVAN, and the second, who was infected with HIV, and on biopsy was found to have hepatitis
C-related hepatitis C related membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. We also review the current literature on HIVAN and HIV-associated
immune complex diseases (HIVICDs). Each case illustrates an important clinical point. The first that renal disease can be the first
manifestation of HIV infection and the second that HIV-infected patients may develop immune complex related renal diseases, some of which
may be potentially treatable.
