We report a case of prostate cancer in 34 year old man presenting with generalized lymphadenopathy mimicking malignant lymphoma without any
urinary symptoms. Lymph node biopsy revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma and immunohistochemical stain was strongly positive to prostate
antigen (PSA). Serum PSA level was also markedly elevated. Transrectal ultrasonogram showed mild enlargement in right lobe of prostate.
Needle biopsy finding of prostate also was consistent with adenocarcinoma. Bone scan revealed multiple metastatic lesions including
vertebrae, ribs, pelvis, and both femurs. Generalized lymphadenopathy and elevated PSA level was decreased after bilateral orchiectomy.
