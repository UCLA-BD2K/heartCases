A 40-year-old patient with toothache and shoulder pain for 10 days died without former known history of cardiac arrhythmias or myocardial
infarction (MI) on sleep-related sudden cardiac death (SCD). The autopsy did not reveal signs for traumatic violence or intoxications nor
for acute/chronic infections particularly of the upper aerodigestive tract. Furthermore, no aspects of endo-/myocarditis including negative
results for cardiotropic virus were evident. In contrast, the right ventricular (RV) myocardium showed a diffuse replacement by fatty tissue
(>70%) and dystrophy of cardiomyocytes (Panel A, arrows indicate endocardium), corresponding to an arrhythmogenic RV dysplasia (ARVD) with
immunohistochemical up-regulation of the cytoskeleton protein desmin (Panel A, inset) and electronmicroscopic detection of abnormal
desmosomes (Panel B, arrowheads and inset). Moreover, the proximal right coronary arteria showed an isolated high-grade stenosis (âˆ¼80%) with
acute subtotal thrombotic obliteration (Panel C, inset histological image) resulting in acute MIs of subendocardial RV myocardium (Panel D,
hypereosinophilic cardiomyocytes without nuclei). Since any signs of backward failure of the left ventricle such as lung oedema were
lacking, we diagnosed an SCD due to acute RV failure in a patient with ARVD and acute MI. ARVD is behind hypertrophic concentric
cardiomyopathy the major non-ischaemic cause for SCD in association with sports activity in young patients (age <40 years). Here, we
describe, to our knowledge, the first case of an ARVD in combination with coronary heart disease/MIs, which might have triggered acute
ventricular arrhythmias/failure independently from physical exertion and should be therefore considered for in vivo/autopsy investigations
in family members of ARVD patients. Funding to pay the Open Access publication charges for this article was provided by the Wilhelm-Sander-
Stiftung and the foundation Fight against Cancer.
