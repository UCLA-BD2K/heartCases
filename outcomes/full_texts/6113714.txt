Between July 1975 and April 1980, 71 patients were admitted to the Second Attached Hospital of Hubei Provincial Medical College in Wuchang
with the diagnosis of epidemic hemorrhagic fever (EHF). The clinical course among these patients was similar to that described for patients
with Korean hemorrhagic fever, and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome of the U.S.S.R. The overall mortality was 11.2 percent. Sera
obtained from some of these patients as well as from patients admitted to the First Attached Hospital of Hubei Provincial Medical College
were tested against an antigen associated with Korean hemorrhagic fever and showed exceedingly high antibody titers. We conclude that EHF in
Central China represents the same or a closely related disease process as Korean hemorrhagic fever.
