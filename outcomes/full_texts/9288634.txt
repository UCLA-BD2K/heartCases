Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is caused by the complete deficiency of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HPRT). By the analysis of
genomic DNA and mRNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique coupled with direct sequencing, five independent mutations in HPRT
genes have been identified in Korean Lesch-Nyhan families. Two novel mutations and three previously reported mutations have been found in
five independent families. Heterozygous carriers were detected in all the families, and prenatal diagnosis was carried out in two families.
