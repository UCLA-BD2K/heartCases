Two cases of vertex epidural hematomas are described to illustrate their unique diagnostic and treatment problems. Due to its specific
location, a correct diagnosis of the intracranial hematoma was delayed in the first case. Quantitative analysis of the hematoma volume was
performed in the second case. We would like to emphasize the usefulness of the magnetic resonance imaging and quantitative analysis of
vertex epidural hematoma in choosing treatment options in such patients.
