Although eosinophilic fasciitis (EF) may precede hematologic malignancy or Hodgkin's disease, association with peripheral T-cell lymphoma
(PTCL) is extremely rare. Only four cases of EF preceding or concomitant PTCL have been reported in the world literature. We experienced the
first Korean case of EF complicated by the later relapse of peripheral T-cell lymphoma. A 63-year-old Korean male has been followed at our
outpatient clinic periodically after treatment for stage IV PTCL. He had been in complete remission for seven and a half years when he
developed edema of both lower extremities followed by sclerodermatous skin change in both hands with peripheral eosinophilia. Biopsy from
the left hand showed fibrous thickening of the fascia with lymphoplasmacytic and eosinophilic infiltrate, consistent with EF. Twenty-five
months later, a newly developed lymph node from the left neck showed recurrence of PTCL. EF may occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome
associated with the relapse of PTCL. Therefore, in a patient with EF, the possibility of coexisting and/or future occurrence of hematologic
neoplasm should be considered.
