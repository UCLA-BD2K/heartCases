We report a case of fulminant supraglottitis with dramatic external cervical swelling due to associated cellulitis. Blood cultures were
positive for Neisseria meningitidis. The patient recovered completely after emergency fiberoptic intubation and appropriate antibiotic
therapy. We summarize five other cases of meningococcal supraglottitis, all reported since 1995, and discuss possible pathophysiologic
mechanisms.
