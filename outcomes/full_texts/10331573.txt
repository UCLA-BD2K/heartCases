Carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater is a relatively rare neoplasm and its longterm survival rate is considerably high. However, because of
differences in tumor pathologic features and local invasiveness, a 5-year survival rate differ widely. We present a case of metastatic
carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater presenting as a Krukenberg tumor in a 59-year-old woman. Eight months earlier, she had been diagnosed as
well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater. Abdominal examination revealed a hard mass with mild tenderness in the RLQ area.
The laboratory findings were unremarkable except for mild anemia. CT scan of the abdomen revealed enlargement of both ovaries. An
exploratory laparotomy disclosed bilateral ovarian masses, 18 x 12 x 8 cm and 8 x 5.5 x 4 cm in size, respectively. Histologic findings of
the both ovarian masses were consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma from the ampulla of Vater.
