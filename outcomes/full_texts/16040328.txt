A 40-year-old woman, gravida 9, with seven healthy children and a history of one abortion (p 7 + 1), presented at 18 weeks of gestation with
fever and malodorous vaginal discharge. Ultrasound revealed a macerated fetus. The placenta showed acute chorioamnionitis and acute villitis
with microabscess formation. Blood and vaginal cultures both grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. This is the first reported case in English
literature of Klebsiella pneumoniae causing suppurative placentitis leading to fetal demise.
