Autoimmune cholangitis (AC) is a recently proposed entity that describes a specific group of patients presenting overlapping features of
primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and autoimmune hepatitis. The disease is characterized by dinical cholestasis, high titer antinuclear
antibody, negative antimitochondrial antibody, and histologically, findings of PBC coexisting with varying degrees of parenchymal
inflammation. In this report, we describe a patient with Sj√∂gren's syndrome who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of AC associated with
unique arthropathy compatible with arthritis of PBC. This case illustrates the unusual coexistence of two diseases that may share similar
pathogenic processes.
