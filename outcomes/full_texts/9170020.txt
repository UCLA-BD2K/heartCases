We experienced an unusual case of cardiac tamponde caused by a rupture of the coronary arteriovenous aneurysm in a 54-year-old woman. The
patient was suffered from sudden chest pain and syncope, and was initially managed by pericardiocentesis following an echocardiogram which
revealed a massive pericardial effusion with signs of cardiac tamponade. She was referred to our hospital under the impression of aortic
dissection with cardiac tamponade. She underwent an emergency operation and was found to have a 2 x 2 cm sized bleeding cystic mass
protruding from the proximal anterior descending coronary artery. The aneurysm was excised and the openings connected with the coronary
artery and right ventricular outflow tract were closed with sutures from the inside of aneurysm. Subsequent coronary arteriography supported
the diagnosis.
