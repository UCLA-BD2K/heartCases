A case of congenital tectal lipoma found incidentally at an autopsy is reported. This female fetus was a product of pregnancy termination at
24 weeks of gestational age after sonographic detection of hydrocephalus. Autopsy revealed a small mass in the periaqueductal portion. The
mass was composed of adipose tissue, cartilage, and mature bony tissue with hematopoiesis. The resultant diagnosis was tectal lipoma with
osteocartilagenous element. It is uncertain whether the lesion represents a teratoma or hamartoma or mesenchymal metaplasia. The
osteocartilagenous component suggests the latter.
