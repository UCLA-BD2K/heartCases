Clinical manifestations of superior sagittal sinus (SSS) thrombosis are nonspecific but characterized by headache, papilledema, seizures,
focal deficits, progressive coma and death. Recurrent transient focal neurologic deficit is an extremely rare manifestation in superior
sagittal sinus thrombosis and the mechanism is unknown. A 45-year-old man presented with headache for two weeks and four episodes of
transient (5-10 minutes) right or left hemiparesis for two days. Magnetic resonance image and transfemoral cerebral angiography revealed
superior sagittal sinus thrombosis with numerous prominent collateral venous channels. There was no parenchymal lesion. After four days of
heparinization, no further transient focal neurologic deficits developed. Follow-up angiography showed partial recanalization of the SSS.
Possible mechanism of transient ischemic attacks in this patient is thought to be a transient functional disturbance due to a temporal
reduction of tissue perfusion in the process of operating fully-enough collateral channels.
