A 28-year-old female attended an outpatient clinic in October, 1989, because of a tumor in the left supraclavicular fossa, detected in a
health examination. Following exploratory puncture of the tumor which yielded milky-white fluid, suggesting a cyst in the thoracic duct, she
was admitted to our department. The cyst was unilocular measuring about 6 cm in diameter, and the fluid content was chyle-rich in lipids.
Lymphography demonstrated a lymphatic structure adjacent to the lesion and scattered lymph vessels on the cyst surface. On November 16 the
cyst was resected. A restiform structure was observed between the cyst and the thoracic duct, but the presence or absence of communication
was unclear. The histological diagnosis was thoracic duct cyst. Thoracic duct cyst occurring in the cervical region is very rare. Our case
may provide useful information as to its pathogenesis and the mode of retention of cyst fluid.
