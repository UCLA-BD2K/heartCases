A patient with a fulminant amebic colitis coexisting with intestinal tuberculosis had a sudden onset of crampy abdominal pain, mucoid
diarrhea, anorexia, fever and vomiting with signs of positive peritoneal irritation. Fulminant amebic colitis occurring together with
intestinal tuberculosis is an uncommon event and may present an interesting patho-etiological relationship. The diagnosis was proven by
histopathologic examination of resected specimen. Subtotal colectomy including segmental resection of ileum, about 80 cm in length, followed
by exteriorization of both ends, was performed in an emergency basis. Despite all measures, the patient died on the sixth postoperative day.
The exact relationship of fulminant amebic colitis and intestinal tuberculosis is speculative but the possibility of a cause and effect
relationship exists. Fulminant amebic colitis may readily be confused with other types of inflammatory bowel disease, such as idiopathic
ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, perforated diverticulitis and appendicitis with perforation. This report draws attention to the
resurgence of tuberculosis and amebiasis in Korea, and the need for the high degree of caution required to detect it.
