This paper reported a case of fusion between an impacted third molar and a supernumerary tooth, in which a surgical intervention was carried
out, with the objective of removing the dental elements. The panoramic radiography was complemented by the Donovan's radiographic technique;
but because of the proximity of the dental element to the mandibular ramus, it was not possible to have a final fusion diagnosis. Hence, the
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography—which provides precise three-dimensional information—was used to determinate the fusion diagnosis and also to
help in the surgical planning. In this case report we observed that the periapical, occlusal and panoramic were not able to show details
which could only be examined through the cone-beam computed tomography.
