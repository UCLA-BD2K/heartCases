Short-term cultures from one synovial chondroma and three cases of synovial chondromatosis, a lesion for which no previous karyotypic
information exists, were cytogenetically analysed. Whereas the chondroma displayed the relatively simple karyotype
46,XY,add(12)(q13),der(17)t(12;17)(q13;q21), more complex changes were found in the three cases of chondromatosis: case 1,
47,XY,der(1)inv(1)(p13q25)del (1)(q25q32), t(1;12)(q25;q13), + 5,der(12)add(12)(p11)t(1;12)(p22;q13); case 2, 47,XY,add(10)(q26), + 20/46
idem,-6/46,XY,t(2;4)(q33;q21), add(21)(p11); and case 3, 44,XY,add(1)(p36), del(1)(p13p22),add(6)(p25), del(7)
(q22q32),del(10)(q21),add(11)(q13),-17,-18. The cytogenetic findings strongly suggest that synovial chondro-matosis is a clonal
proliferation. Apart from a near-diploid chromosome number, the only recurrent cytogenetic features among the four cases were loss of band
10q26 and rearrangements of 1p13 and 12q13, found in two cases each. While chromosome bands 1p13 and 10q26 have not been reported to be
involved in other types of benign chondromatous lesions, the 12q13-15 segment is recurrently rearranged in a variety of chondromatous
tumours, e.g. pulmonary chondroid hamartomas. The present finding of translocations affecting band 12q13 in two of the cases emphasises
that, irrespective of the anatomical localisation of the tumours, rearrangements of genes in 12q13-15 are important in the development of a
large subset of benign and malignant cartilage-forming tumours.
