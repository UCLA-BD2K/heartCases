We report the case of a 60-year-old man with mild Christmas disease, Factor IX 10% of normal, who developed chronic hepatitis C infection
after receiving coagulation factor concentrates. Subsequently he developed encephalopathy and liver failure and was referred for liver
transplantation. Following transplantation, Factor IX levels rapidly normalised and have remained so, representing a phenotypic cure of his
Christmas disease.
