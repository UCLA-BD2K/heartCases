We had an opportunity to evaluate a child who developed fever approximately two to three weeks after the open heart surgery for tetralogy of
Fallot. His peripheral blood smear showed rings and various stages of Plasmodium vivax. The patient had received packed red blood cells
during the surgery and postoperative care, one unit of which was later proved sero-positive for malaria. The possibility of malaria should
be included in the differential diagnosis of the patients with unexplained fever after multiple blood product transfusions for the open
heart surgery.
