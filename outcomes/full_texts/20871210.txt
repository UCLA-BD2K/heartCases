endoscopy revealed a lesion in the stomach [Figure 1]. Lesion in the stomach Q1. What is the diagnosis?Q2. Which is the most effective
treatment to control bleeding from this condition?Q3. What percentage of patients re-bleed? Q1. What is the diagnosis? Q2. Which is the most
effective treatment to control bleeding from this condition? Q3. What percentage of patients re-bleed? A1. Dieulafoy’s lesion is an uncommon
cause for upper GI bleeding. Common site for this lesion is near the Gastro- esophageal junction lesion. Incidence is 2-5% of upper GI
bleeding. The symptoms are either of hematemesis or melena. Upper GI endoscopy helps in diagnosis as well as treatment.A2. Contact thermal
ablation with heater probe with or without adrenalin injection.A.3. 11-15%. Most cases of rebleeding can be effectively controlled by repeat
endoscopic therapy. A1. Dieulafoy’s lesion is an uncommon cause for upper GI bleeding. Common site for this lesion is near the Gastro-
