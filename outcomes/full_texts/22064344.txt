A 19-year-old young man presented with multiple episodes of rectal bleeding of 2 years duration. On physical examination, he had severe
pallor and an asymmetric, edematous hypertrophy of left lower limb with multiple dilated and tortuous veins present along the posterolateral
aspect [Figure 1]. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated significant anemia with hemoglobin of 6.9 g/dL and hematocrit of 20.9%. Diagnostic
colonoscopy demonstrated venous ectasia extending from the dentate line to descending colon [Figure 2]. No active bleeding was noted.
Esophago-gastroduodenoscopy was unremarkable. Clinical photograph showing asymmetric, edematous hypertrophy of left lower limb Colonoscopy
showing multiple venous ectasia in rectum Q1. What is the diagnosis? The clinical picture is consistent with the diagnosis of
Klippel–Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS). Noted French physicians Maurice Klippel and Paul Trenaunay described this syndrome in 1900 which is
characterized by a triad of vascular malformations, venous varicosity and bony and/or soft tissue hypertrophy. Visceral vascular
malformations are uncommon in KTS but may cause significant morbidity and mortality. Gastrointestinal malformations are more common than
those of genitourinary tract. Bleeding is the most common manifestation of intestinal vascular malformations and may prove to be a
potentially life-threatening emergency. Platelet sequestration with secondary consumption of clotting factors within the venous sinusoids of
the visceral vascular malformations may further enhance bleeding (Kasabach–Merritt phenomenon). Source of Support: Nil Conflict of Interest:
