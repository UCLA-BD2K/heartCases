Remitting seronegative symmetric synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE) syndrome is characterized by symmetrical and acute synovitis, pitting
edema, the absence of rheumatoid factor, increased acute phase reactants, lack of bony erosions on radiography, and benign and short
clinical course. Half of all patients with Sjogren's syndrome experience arthritis during the disease course. We here describe the first
case of Sjogren's syndrome presenting as RS3PE. She had swelling in knees, ankles, and wrists. After then the swelling spread to her lower
legs, feet, face, and both hands. She was admitted to another hospital and was suspected of lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. Three months
later, she had dry mouth and had lower lip biopsy. She was admitted to this hospital due to development of swelling in face and lower legs
for 3 days. On physical examination, she had pitting edema in both hands and feet dorsum. Laboratory test showed elevated erythrocyte
sedimentation rate, positivity of rheumatoid factor, anti-nuclear antibody, and anti-Ro antibody. There was no erosion in the hands
radiography. Schirmer's test and lip biopsy was compatible with Sjogren's syndrome. She was diagnosed RS3PE and Sjogren's syndrome. She was
begun with prednisolone and her symptoms improved gradually.
