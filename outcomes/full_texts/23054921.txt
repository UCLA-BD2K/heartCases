A 33-year-old woman presented with five days of dysarthria and dysphagia. Her past medical history included Graves’ disease treated with a
partial thyroidectomy five years earlier. On examination, she had tongue mounding and deviation to the right (Figs. 1 and 2). Other
neurological and otorhinolaryngological findings were normal. Titers of herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus antibodies were
positive, but did not differ between the acute and convalescent phase sera. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance
angiogram (MRA) findings were normal, and laboratory tests showed no evidence of inflammation. Idiopathic isolated unilateral hypoglossal
nerve palsy was diagnosed.Figure 1.Right tongue mounding at rest.Figure 2.Tongue deviation to the right. Right tongue mounding at rest.
Tongue deviation to the right. While cranial nerves III, IV, VI and VII are more prone to idiopathic palsy, idiopathic unilateral
hypoglossal nerve palsy is rare. With the limited number of cases reported, the male-to-female ratio appears even, the age of onset is
widely distributed (20–69 years) and the majority of cases self-resolve.1 In acute isolated hypoglossal nerve palsy, malignancy, vascular
pathology, herpes infection, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis and diabetic mononeuropathy have been reported as causes.1–3
Although the paired sera failed to show acute herpes infection in this case, reactivation of the disease could still be possible. Eight
weeks after symptom onset, this patient fully recovered without intervention. This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative
