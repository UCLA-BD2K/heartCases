Tumor-to-tumor metastasis is rare. We report a case of metastatic renal cell carcinoma in meningioma. A 67-year-old woman presented a two-
week history of motor dysphagia and decreased short-term memory. She had undergone a left radical nephrectomy for a renal cell carcinoma 7
years ago, and had not received any adjuvant therapy. MRI disclosed a 3.0 x 3.0 x 3.0-cm sized round tentorial-based extraaxial mass with
peritumoral edema in the left posterior temporal lobe. During operation, the tumor was found to be an encapsulated mass firmly attached to
the tentorium. Histologically, the tumor was a meningotheliomatous meningioma extensively infiltrated by metastatic renal cell carcinoma,
accompanying widespread coagulative necrosis. Immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin revealed strong positivity only in the renal cell
carcinoma component. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. Post-operative radiation therapy was applied to the whole brain.
Three months after operation, the patient developed right hemiparesis and dysphagia. Brain MRI at that time did not reveal recurrence or any
other causative lesions, although the whole body scan disclosed uptake at the second lumbar vertebra and rib. The patient refused further
treatment.
