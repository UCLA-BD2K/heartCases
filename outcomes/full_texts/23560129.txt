We report on the case of a 54 years old man treating for a metastatic renal carcinoma who had experienced a dermatological toxicity
referring to sunitinb intake. The antiangiogenic drug was delivered at a daily dose of 50mg for 4 weeks followed by two weeks of rest. By
the second week of treatment the patient presented a nappy erythema evolving towards erosive lesions bleeding at mild friction and extending
to the perianal and scrotal area, the process fulfilled the maximal intensity at 4 weeks and improved after the discontinuation of
sunitinib. The patient refused the reintroduction of the drug. No skin biopsy was developed seeing that the lesions disappeared 4 weeks
later. Figure 1 Erosive nappy erythema (A) and scrotal erythema (B)
