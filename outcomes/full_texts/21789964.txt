The distinction of some particular forms of periapical area, involving diseases from regular periapical disease, is a matter of considerable
importance when choosing a correct treatment. The aim of this study is to describe the differential diagnosis of periapical diseases from
six rare cases in clinical practice. The six rare cases are examples of situations where it is difficult to make a differential diagnosis in
clinical practice. By retrospective surveys on the clinical examination, radiographs and pathological results, six patients referred to
endodontic treatment in our department were analyzed for the accuracy of diagnosis and therapy. The pathoses of the six cases included two
atypical radical cysts, periapical cemental dysplasia, cemento-ossifying fibroma, thymus cancer metastasis in the periapical site and
tuberculosis. This report indicates that endodontists should be cognizant of a few particular circumstances when clinically treating
periapical diseases.
