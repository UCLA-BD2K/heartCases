A patient found to have ectopic Cushing's syndrome three months after surgical resection of cloacogenic carcinoma of the anal canal was
studied with serial plasma cortisol and ACTH measurements. The effects of therapy on plasma ACTH and cortisol levels were noted. An autopsy
was performed immediately after death and liver metastatic tumor tissue was assayed for "small" ACTH, "big" ACTH, PTH, and alpha sub-unit of
hCG, Clinical Cushing's syndrome was observed along with nonsuppressible plasma cortisol level. Plasma ACTH only reached the highest normal
level but tumor ACTH ("small"), "big" ACTH, alpha sub-unit and PTH were markedly elevated. It was concluded that a case of classic
cloacogenic carcinoma of the anal canal produced ectopic Cushing's syndrome. Elevated tumor alpha sub-unit and PTH were not associated with
appreciable biologic activity. Ectopic Cushing's syndrome in this disease may imply poorer prognosis.
