The term "chordoid meningioma" means meningioma, which is pathologically similar to chordoma, and previously reported that rarely associated
with microcytic anemia and/or dysgammaglobulinemia especially in pediatric population. We present a case of this rare variant, which
comprises less than 0.5% of all meningiomas. A 33-yr-old man visited our hospital, complaining visual field defect worsening over 7 yr.
Neurological examination showed left homonymous hemianopsia. The brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed well enhancing right temporo-
occipital mass with cystic portion. Histopathologic findings of resected tumor were compatible with chordoid meningioma which included
trabeculae of eosinophilic, vacuolated cells in a myxoid matrix with prominent lymphoplasmacellular infiltration. The neoplastic cells were
positive for vimentin and epithelial membrane antigen and negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein and cytokeratin. This is an adult
case of chordoid meningioma without anemia or dysgammaglobulinemia.
