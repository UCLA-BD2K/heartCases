This paper is the first in a new Clinical Feature Series that will be a regular feature in future issues of The Yale Journal of Biology and
Medicine. Papers in the series will focus on cases and disease processes of general interest to the practicing clinician, with the goal
being to present the perspectives of expert clinicians regarding the accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of the diseases being
discussed. The following case was presented at Medical Grand Rounds at the Yale-New Haven Hospital and the Yale School of Medicine by John
P. Hayslett, Professor of Medicine (Nephrology) with accompanying analysis of pathological specimens by Dr. Hugh Carey, a Postdoctoral
Fellow of the Pathology staff. The patient whose case is presented was also present to describe her experience with the illness and the
course of treatment.
