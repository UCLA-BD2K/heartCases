Human leukemic cells were induced to proliferate and mature to macrophage-like cells in primary cultures supplemented with conditioned
medium (CM) from phytohemagglutinin and alloantigen-stimulated normal T lymphocytes. Blast and promyelocyte-enriched preparations, isolated
after depletion of adherent phagocytic cells and lymphoid cells from samples of myelogenous leukemia patients, were suspended in liquid
cultures with 30% CM. Cell cycle analysis was performed throughout the course of induced cellular maturation. Within 24 h of exposure to CM,
cells with macrophage-like morphology were identified among the developing adherent cells. Approximately 15-30% of the cells in culture
suspensions also developed macrophage-like morphology and esterase reactivity with alpha-napthyl acetate after incubation for 2 d. The
number of these nonproliferating cells increased and became predominant in the later culture period. Flow cytometric measurement of DNA
content showed that these mature cells had the same aneuploid stemline as the undifferentiated leukemic cells, indicating that genetically
abnormal leukemic cells can be induced to differentiate. Reduction in the total RNA content of the macrophage-like cells was also determined
by flow cytometry. Reduction in RNA and development of adherent cells served as early markers of maturation, in addition to the later
acquisition of complement receptors and phagocytic capacity. Cell cycle analysis showed that CM stimulated the proliferation of immature
cells. This initial proliferation may precede intertwined events of proliferation and concurrent maturation of immature cells. Later in the
culture period, cellular proliferation decreased, leading to termination of the cultures.
