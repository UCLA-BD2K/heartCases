Chronic hepatitis associated with hypereosinophilia has been very rarely reported worldwide. A 7-month-old male infant presented with a high
fever, cough, non-projectile vomiting and hepatomegaly. The eosinophil count of the peripheral blood increased up to 21,500/mm3 (49% of
WBC). The infant had a history of frequent contact with a neighbor keeping a pigsty. The pathologic examinations of the liver showed severe
porto-periportal necroinflammation with marked eosinophilic infiltration, giant cell transformation and ballooning degeneration of
hepatocytes, and degranulation of the eosinophils. Bone marrow showed increased eosinophils and decreased myeloid series. Pericardial
effusion and bilateral pulmonary consolidation were noted. Corticosteroid aggravated the clinical symptoms of the infant. Anthelmintic
treatment significantly normalized the eosinophil count and liver function tests, but cardiopulmonary manifestations continued.
