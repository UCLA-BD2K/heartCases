A 42-year-old male with a history of multiple shoulder dislocations presented to the emergency department via emergency medical services
with both arms locked above his head, stating that he had been jumped at a bar and had since been unable to move his arms. A single
anteroposterior chest radiograph (Figure) demonstrates bilateral inferior shoulder dislocations. The humeral head (white arrow) is displaced
from the glenoid (yellow arrow) on each side. Inferior shoulder dislocations are the rarest of all glenohumeral joint dislocations,
accounting for less than 1%; and bilateral inferior dislocations are therefore extremely infrequent. The classic presentation is the patient
whose arm is locked above his head in a hyper-abducted fashion. The inferior dislocation must first be converted to an anterior dislocation
by slowly adducting the arm. The anterior dislocation can then be reduced using routine maneuvers. In our case the patient underwent
reduction with propofol sedation and was placed in bilateral shoulder slings. He was observed overnight by the orthopedic service for
ethanol metabolism and was safely discharged home the next day in bilateral arm slings. Supervising Section Editor: Sean O. Henderson, MD
