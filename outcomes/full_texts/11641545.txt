Idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis (IHP) is a rare, chronic nonspecific and granulomatous inflammatory disorder of the dura with
unknown etiology. The diagnosis can be established by open biopsy and exclusion of all other specific granulomatous and infectious diseases.
We report a typical case of spinal IHP occurring in a long segment of cervical and thoracic dura from C6 to T8. The patient was 56-yr-old
female, who had been suffered from pain on her upper back and both arms for 3 months and recent onset motor weakness of both legs. During
the 9 months of follow-up period, she experienced the improvement of her neurologic symptoms with combined therapy of partial excision and
corticosteroid medication. Since early surgical intervention and subsequent pulse steroid therapy are mandatory for this disease to avoid
irreversible damage of nervous system, the identification of this unique disease entity is essential on frozen diagnosis. A few cases have
been reported in Korean literature.
