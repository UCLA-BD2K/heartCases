A rare case of polyangiitis overlap syndrome is described. The patient was a 25-year-old man who had palpable purpura on his legs which
showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and polyarteritis nodosa. Superior mesenteric arteriography showed microaneurysms in jejunal branches
with focal segmental necrotizing arteritis of small and medium sized muscular arteries in the jejunum. Deposits of IgA and C3 in the
superficial blood vessels of the lesional skin were consistent with the features of Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura. The patient died about two
months after initial admission in spite of cytotoxic agent and steroid administration.
