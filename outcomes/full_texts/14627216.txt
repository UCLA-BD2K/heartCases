provides adequate pain relief during labor and delivery, and is considered to be a safe procedure with limited complications. The prevalence
of infection after lumbar epidural analgesia is negligible. Introduction: Infection of the sacroiliac joint, although very close to the
pucture area, has never been reported as a procedure complication. Case: In this report, we describe a patient who experienced bacterial
sacroiliitis a few days after lumbar epidural analgesia for labor. No portal of entry was identified, and we evoked a new potential risk
factor that has never been proposed before, namely lumbar epidural analgesia. Conclusion: Sacroiliitis must be considered as a rare but
serious complication of lumbar epidural analgesia.
