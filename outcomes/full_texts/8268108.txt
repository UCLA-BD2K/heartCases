pancreas and/or retroperitoneal adipose tissue. Toxicity results from the dead tissue and secondary infection. A 45 year old patient, while
fully immunosuppressed, developed this complication following cadaveric renal transplantation. He survived continued immunosuppression, 16
operative debridements of the retroperitoneum, and maintained a functioning renal transplant. In view of the previously reported high
mortality rates from mild pancreatitis after transplantation, the current experience warrants further evaluation of the open method of
treatment.
