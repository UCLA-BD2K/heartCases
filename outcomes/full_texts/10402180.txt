This paper presents an unusual solid mesenchymal hamartoma of the liver (MHL) in adult. A well defined solid mass in the left lobe of the
liver was found in a 57-year-old female. Preoperative radiologic examinations demonstrated solid mass with multifocal calcifications
abutting the gallbladder. By light microscopy, the lesion was composed of dense fibrous stroma with hyalinization, bile ducts and thick-
walled vessels without hepatocytes. The solid and hyalinized mesenchymal component would suggest an unusual degenerative change representing
a burnt-out MHL.
