Supervising Section Editor: Sean O. Henderson, MD A 27 year-old previously healthy man complained of sudden onset of gagging and foreign-
body sensation that awoke him. He reported one day of nasal and sinus congestion. He had become concerned when he saw his extremely enlarged
uvula while looking in a mirror (Figure). He had no fever, throat pain, or difficulty breathing, swallowing, or speaking. Prior to going to
bed, he had taken an over-the-counter cold and allergy medication which he had taken previously without any adverse effects; he was not
taking any other medications. He was admitted to the intensive care unit overnight for close observation and treated with nebulized racemic
epinephrine, intravenous antihistamines and steroids. Empiric antibiotics directed against the most common infectious agents, Haemophilus
and Streptococcus species were given.1 He had rapid improvement in his symptoms over the next 24 hours and was discharged home. Uvulitis can
