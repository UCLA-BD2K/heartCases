A 60-year-old woman was admitted for an acute coronary syndrome. Coronary angiography showed a spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD)
in the left anterior descending coronary artery (A). A typical image of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) was also observed in the right renal
artery (B). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) (C) revealed alternating areas of thickening and thinning of the medial layer, corresponding
to the typical image of "string of beads" readily identified in the longitudinal reconstruction of the OCT and also in angiography. A very
high prevalence of FMD in non-coronary arteries has been recently reported in patients with DCE. Our findings suggest that OCT may provide
unique diagnostic clues in these challenging patients. Potential Conflict of Interest No potential conflict of interest relevant to this
article was reported. Sources of Funding There were no external funding sources for this study. Author contributions Conception and design

dissertation work. Panel A: Coronary angiography showing a linear filling defect in left anterior descending coronary artery, corresponding
with the SCAD (arrows). Panel B: Renal artery angiography disclosing the typical image of FMD (arrows). Panel C: OCT of renal the artery
depicting the characteristic areas of thickening (asterisks) and thinning (arrows) of the middle layer.
