A 23-year-old spray painter developed contact dermatitis and respiratory difficulty characterized by small airways obstruction shortly after
the polyfunctional aziridine cross-linker CX-100 began to be used in his workplace as a paint activator. The symptoms resolved after he was
removed from the workplace and was treated with inhaled and topical steroids. Painters may have an increased risk of asthma due to exposure
to a variety of agents, such as isocyanates, alkyd resins, and chromates. This case illustrates the importance of using appropriate work
practices and personal protective equipment to minimize exposure. Occupational asthma is diagnosed by a history of work-related symptoms and
exposure to known causative agents. The diagnosis is confirmed by serial pulmonary function testing or inhalational challenge testing. The
risk of asthma attributable to occupational exposures is probably underappreciated due to underreporting and to inappropriate use of narrow
definitions of exposure in epidemiologic studies of attributable risk.
