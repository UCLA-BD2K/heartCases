A 55 year-old Caucasian man, with Diabetes Melitus type 2 history, presented to our department with complaints of multiple, dark red papules
located on the scrotum. The diagnosis of Fordyce angiokeratoma was clinically established. No special treatment was recommended, apart from
patient's reassurance for the benign nature of this clinical entity. Fordyce angiokeratoma or angiokeratoma of the scrotum was first
described in 1896 by John Addison Fordyce. Its etiology remains unclear, while its incidence is believed to increase with age. Genetic
background of the disease has not been documented. Complications are generally uncommon, however bleeding of the papules can occur.
Differential diagnosis mainly includes angiokeratoma corporis diffusum, malignant melanoma and nevomelanocytic nevus. In cases of diagnostic
dilemma, dermoscopy can be useful, but biopsy of the lesion is the gold standard method for the establishment of the diagnosis. Specific
treatment is unnecessary, still, excision, electrodessication and laser therapy have been described in complicated cases or for aesthetic
reasons. Fordyce Angiokeratomas on the scrotum
