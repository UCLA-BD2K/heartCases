Cervicocerebral arterial dissection is an important cause of stroke in young adults; the onset is often characterised by severe occipital
headache, followed by nausea, vomiting and vertigo, mimicking a migraine attack. We describe herewith a case of vertebral arterial
dissection with cerebellar infarction, which started with a posterior headache and neurovegetative symptoms, without other signs.
Recommendations for recognition of similar cases, potentially dangerous and treatable, are discussed.
