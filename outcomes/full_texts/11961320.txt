Cutaneous nocardiosis, which usually manifests in the form of pustules, abscesses, or subcutaneous nodules, is occasionally found in
immunocompromised patients. A 59-yr-old Korean man with myasthenia gravis and thymoma developed nodular skin lesions on his trunk.
Histopathologically, abscess formation with a dense infiltrate of neutrophils and many cytophagic histiocytes were observed. Numerous
filamentous organisms, which turned out to be Nocardia asteroides by culture, were also found. After sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim therapy,
all of the skin lesions rapidly decreased in size, with a marked diminution of the number of cytophagic histiocytes, and cleared up within
four months. On reporting a case of cutaneous nocardiosis showing unusual histopathologic findings, we considered that reactive conditions
should be included in the differential diagnosis of the cutaneous cytophagocytosis, and that nocardiosis could be one of the diseases
showing reactive cytophagocytosis.
