Actinomycosis has been rarely reported in patients with HIV/AIDS in contrast to other opportunistic and common pathogens. We report a case
of esophageal ulcer disease, secondary to actinomycosis occurring in a patient with recurrent odynophagia. The diagnosis was made
histologically only after repeated upper endoscopy with biopsies.
