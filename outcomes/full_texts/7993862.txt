lymphangiomas usually arise in areas such as the neck and axilla, where loose connective tissue allows the expansion of lymphatic channels.
The case of a 65-year old male is described, who presented with a solitary lymphangioma in the liver. The lesion was discovered incidentally
and due to diagnostic uncertainty was removed surgically. A short review of histology, clinical presentation and preoperative diagnostic
difficulties of hepatic lymphangiomas is given.
