We present a case of lumbosacral fracture-dislocation, which was spontaneously reduced during radiological examination. Such rapid reduction
is, however, not reliable for long-term stability. We would like to report this case briefly because spontaneous reduction of lumbosacral
fracture-dislocation has not been reported previously.
