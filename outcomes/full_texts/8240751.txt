We report a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), who had developed metabolic alkalosis during plasmapheresis. The metabolic
alkalosis could be promptly corrected by reducing the amount of citrate load. The development of metabolic alkalosis can be explained by the
citrate load during plasmapheresis. Careful monitoring of acid base status is mandatory in patients with limited renal function and the
reduction of citrate load may be advisable in plasmapheresis.
