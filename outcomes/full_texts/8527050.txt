In some patients, eosinophilic gastroenteritis(EG) occurs in those with food allergy. We experienced a non-atopic asthmatic who had an EG
associated with food allergy to fish and eggs, and blood eosinophilia. A skin prick test and RAST to causative food allergens showed a
negative result. A fiber-optic endoscopic biopsy from the gastric mucosa showed an intense eosinophilic infiltration. We could find
symptomatic improvement and a disappearance of eosinophilic infiltration in gastric mucosa after complete avoidance from the causative food
and oral cortcosteroid. It was suggested that fiber-optic endoscopic biopsy might be needed to identify coexisting EG if an allergic patient
with blood eosinophilia complains of severe gastrointestinal symptoms.
