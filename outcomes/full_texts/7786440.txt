A case of Cushing's syndrome due to bilateral pigmented nodular adrenal disease in a 35-year-old male is presented. The adrenals showed
multiple, black, variable sized nodules. Histologically the cells contained lipofuscin and either had a clear cytoplasm or an eosinophilic
cytoplasm with a prominent nucleus. Lymphocytic infiltration and fatty metaplasia within the nodules are two of the prominent histological
features. There is extreme internodular atrophy which suggests that primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease is a non-
adrenocorticotropic hormone dependent condition. Since the disorder appears to involve primarily the cortex of both adrenals, the treatment
of choice is bilateral adrenalectomy followed by steroid replacement. The characteristic clinicopathological manifestations that separate
this diagnosis from other types of adrenal disease are also discussed. This is the first reported case in Korea to be documented with the
pertinent clinicopathological findings.
