We report an unusual primary case of pulmonary sarcoma that developed in the lung of a 36-year-old woman. The tumor had histologic,
immunologic and ultrastructural features identical to those of biphasic synovial sarcoma of the soft tissue. It consisted of an intimate
admixture of cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen(EMA)-positive neoplastic epithelial cells and vimentin-positive fibroblast-like
spindle cells with areas of hyalinization. The patient had a lobectomy and showed no evidence of recurrence or tumor at other sites 15
months after surgery. This case is an useful addition to the small number of published reports on pulmonary synovial sarcoma. The
distinctive features of this neoplasm allow it to be different from other types of primary and metastatic malignancies in the lung.
