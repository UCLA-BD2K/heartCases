A 49-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency room with fever for 5 days and nasal bleeding. A tick bite was learned to have
occurred 10 days before. On physical examination, the patient was confused, with a fever of 39 Â°C and widespread petechiae. In his
laboratory examination, hemoglobin was 9 g/dL, WBC count was 16,000/mm3, and platelet count was 8000/mm3. In Giemsa-stained peripheral blood
smear, rare schistocytes and platelets, 80% neutrophils, 18% lymphocytes, and 2% monocytes were observed. In the cytoplasm of a
lymphomonocytic cell, a blue-violet inclusion body was seen (Figure 1). Informed consent was obtained. The patient was prediagnosed with
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and accordingly administered fresh frozen plasma and platelet therapy. The patient was lost after
massive gastrointestinal bleeding as a result of multiple organ failure. A positive PCR result was obtained for CCHF. Inclusion bodies in
leukocytes can be seen in congenital diseases, hematological malignancies, infections (especially viral), burns, and pregnancy and after
cytotoxic therapy. To the best of our knowledge, in the diagnosis of CCHF, inclusion bodies in leukocytes have not been reported previously
in the literature. We suggest that they be remembered as a potential clue in diagnosis during peripheral blood smear examination. Conflict
