A 15-year-old adolescent presented to us with mild headache, progressive dizziness and recent vomiting since 2 weeks without seizures. There
was a history of head injury (neglected) following a stone-throwing incident 2 months earlier. On examination, he was conscious with a left
cerebellar syndrome but without other neurologic deficit. Routine biologic data were normal. CT-scan revealed left posterior fossa
extradural lesion with hypodensity in the center and calcified wall (A). MRI showed that the lesion was liquid with homogeneous ring
enhancement following gadolinium injection and cerebellar compression (B and C). A sub-occipital craniotomy was done and a chronic liquefied
hematoma was removed. There was a thick hard calcified wall relatively adherent to the duramater (D). Postoperative period was uneventful
and the patient was discharged symptoms free. Histologically, the wall contains large areas of ossification. Ossified chronic epidural
hematoma is a very rare complication following head injury. The blood accumulates slowly from a venous source becomes chronic extradural
hematoma and becomes calcified or ossified due to an inflammatory reaction of the dura especially in children. This rare phenomenon should
be considered in the differential diagnosis of other traumatic epidural and subdural hematomas. Axial CT-scan. (A): revealing a left
posterior fossa chronic extradural biconvex lesion with ossified wall (arrow). MRI: Axial T1-weighted image after gadolinium injection; (B):
T2-weighted image; (C): fluid-liquid lesion with homogeneous ring enhancement and significant cerebellar compression; (D): operative view
demonstrating the ossified wall (arrow) after superficial dissection from the duramater
