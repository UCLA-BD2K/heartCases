Achondrogenesis is a lethal form of congenital chondrodystrophy characterized by extreme micromelia. We describe a case of achondrogenesis
type II (Langer-Saldino achondrogenesis) detected by prenatal ultrasonography at 20-week gestation. A dwarfed fetus with large head, short
neck and chest, prominent abdomen and short limbs was terminated transvaginally. Radiologic and histopathologic examination revealed
features of mild form of achondrogenesis type II. Although the case had no known risk factor and the phenotypic abnormality was mild, modern
development in prenatal screening made the early detection possible.
