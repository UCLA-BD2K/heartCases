there are few reports of tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) after supracervical hysterectomy. Case: The case of a 49-year-old woman with a right TOA
is reported. This patient had received a supracervical hysterectomy 16 years earlier due to rupture of the uterus. At this admission, she
presented with complaints of lower abdominal pain and fever. Bimanual and transvaginal ultrasound examinations demonstrated a tender mass in
the right adnexal region. Laparotomy, pathologic examination and microbiologic study confirmed the diagnosis of right TOA. Conclusion: After
supracervical hysterectomy, patients may develop endocervicitis, parametritis and/or TOA. This series may be a subtype of ascending
infections in the female genital tract.
