biliary tract1 and is often found seredipitiously after cholecystectomy. We report the first two cases of incidental GBCA in the native
gallbladder of two liver transplant recipients. Both patients are 2.5 years following uneventful orthotopiic liver transplantation(OLTx)
with no evidence of recurrent disease. Pathology of both recipients was early and favorable. Neither patient received any further therapy.
Given the incidence of GBCA and the evolution of OLTx we would anticipate this finding to be more prevalent.
