hepatocellular carcinoma, which mainly affects a young age group and carries a relatively good prognosis. It is widely accepted that
aggressive curative resection is still the best option for FHCC. We report here a case of successful arterialisation of the portal vein with
an aortoportal jump graft for portal vein thrombosis, which developed postoperatively in an already comprised portal vein with tumour
invasion following an extensive liver resection for FHCC.
