An elderly man was diagnosed with celiac disease, which presented with three notable features: first, presentation at the age of 70 with no
prior gastrointestinal symptomatology or positive family history; second, triggering of all symptoms following recent myocardial infarction
and infective endocarditis; third, presentation with marked (more than 20 percent) weight loss and pellagra-like skin lesions despite nearly
normal examination and laboratory tests. Thus, celiac disease may present as a pellagra-like syndrome in the elderly with predominant weight
loss that is enhanced by the related taste disturbances.
