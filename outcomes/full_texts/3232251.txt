Untreated massive pulmonary embolism is associated with a high mortality. Pulmonary embolectomy has been largely superceded by thrombolytic
therapy, but there are cases in which pulmonary embolectomy remains the treatment of choice. We present three case reports and discuss the
merits of the various treatments available for massive pulmonary embolism. The primary treatment of massive pulmonary embolism should be
thrombolytic therapy, but for patients who are at risk of haemorrhage following surgery, who are in cardiogenic shock despite medical
treatment, or fail to improve following cardiac arrest, then pulmonary embolectomy remains the treatment of choice.
