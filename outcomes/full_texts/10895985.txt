Intradural extramedullary (IDEM) tuberculoma of the spinal cord is uncommon entity and moreover, few reports have been documented on
concurrent IDEM and intracranial tuberculomas. Authors report a case of IDEM spinal tuberculoma having intracranial lesion simultaneously. A
49-year-old woman suffered from paraparesis and urinary incontinence while being given medical treatment for tuberculous meningitis.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an IDEM mass lesion between the T1 and T2 spinal levels, and multiple intracranial tuberculous
granulomas. Surgical resection of the IDEM tuberculoma followed by anti-tuberculous medication resulted in good outcome.
