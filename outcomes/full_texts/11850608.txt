Intrasellar location of schwannoma is extremely rare, although intracranial schwannomas account for up to 8% of all primary brain tumors. An
unusual case of an intrasellar schwannoma radiographically and clinically simulating a pituitary adenoma is reported. A 39-yr-old man
presented a 10-month history of visual disturbance and decreased libido. Neurological examination showed poor visual acuity of both eyes
with bitemporal hemianopsia. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a sellar tumor with suprasellar extension. Pituitary
adenoma was considered as a preoperative diagnosis. The tumor was removed through a trans-sphenoidal approach. Microscopic examination of
the tumor revealed schwannoma.
