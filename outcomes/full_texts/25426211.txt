A 53-year-old man, previously healthy, presented with a slow-progressive enlarging mass in the midfrontal area which had developed 14 years
previously without headache. On physical examination, this nodular reddish mass (11 x 7 x 5 cm) was fluctuant to pressure and tethered to
the underlying frontal bone (A). There was no neurological deficit and no superficial lymph nodes. Cranial computed tomography scan showed
an irregular median calvarial defect with poorly bony defined margins and left frontal sinus invasion (B-C). Magnetic resonance imaging
revealed intracranial extension of the tumour which invaded the dura and the superior longitudinal sinus (D-E). Local biopsy was performed
and histological study consisted with a dermatofibrosarcoma. In this specific case, radiotherapy was planned before surgical excision and
craniofacial reconstruction. Dermatofibrosarcoma is a slow-growing mesenchymatous tumour of the skin with high local malignancy and great
opportunity of recurrence. It usually occurs in the trunk or extremities. In the majority of cases the tumour remains asymptomatic for a
long time. Head (scalp) and maxillofacial involvement is rare particularly with skull vault and intracranial extension. To improve local
control after surgery, wide excision is recommended but difficult in significant anatomic region as in our case. Patient photograph showing
