Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA) is a very rare genetic disorder of the peripheral nervous system characterized by
recurrent episodes of unexplained fever, generalized anhidrosis, insensitivity to pain and temperature, and accompanied by self-mutilating
behavior and mental retardation. We report on a 16 month-old boy with CIPA who exhibited these characteristic clinical features. A sural
nerve biopsy revealed markedly reduced numbers of unmyelinated and small myelinated fibers, consistent with the characteristic features of
CIPA.
