A rare case of intraventricular germinoma in the third ventricle, which occurred 30 months after total removal of mature teratoma on the
same location in a 29- yr-old man is presented. Recurrence is supposed to represent an acceleration of localized dysplastic processes of
totipotent germ cells present in the midline neuraxis or a growth of unidentified microscopic residue of germinoma component in mature
teratoma. Although the radiation therapy after total removal of mature teratoma is still controversial, careful follow-up is warranted for
evaluating a possible recurrence of other germ cell tumors.
