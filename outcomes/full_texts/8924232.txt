A case of xanthoma of the liver in a 61-year-old Korean woman with multiple myeloma, hyperlipidemia and xanthoma of the skin is described.
Microscopically, the liver showed a multiple xanthomatous collection of foamy histiocytes as well as diffuse sinusoidal infiltration of the
foam cells. This hepatic accumulation of foam cells seems to be related to hyperlipidemia of the patient. The mechanism of hyperlipidemia in
multiple myeloma is discussed.
