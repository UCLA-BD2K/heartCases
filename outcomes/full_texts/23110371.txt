A 70-year-old man presented with a 6-year history of oedema of both lower extremities. Ultrasonic examination showed bilateral anterior
tibial artery occlusion due to thrombosis, moderate bilateral pleural effusions and ascites. He had severe pancytopenia, chronic renal
dysfunction (serum creatinine 223·8 μmol/l and more than 1 g/24 h of urinary protein) and, on ultrasound examination, mildly enlarged
kidneys showing diffuse damage. Serum and urine electrophoresis with immunofixation revealed both monoclonal IgG lambda and monoclonal IgG
kappa immunoglobulins (top left). Serum calcium and phosphate were normal, as were the results of a radiographic skeletal survey. Wright's
staining of a bone marrow film showed that plasma cells accounted for 13% of nucleated marrow cells. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were
enriched by density gradient centrifugation and dual immunofluorescence staining then showed that 13%, 7% and 6% of mononuclear cells were
positive for lambda alone (red arrows), kappa alone (green arrows) or both lambda and kappa light chains (yellow arrows), respectively (top
right, bottom left and bottom right). Cells staining for lambda alone, kappa alone or both lambda and kappa were also demonstrated in
ascitic fluid. A diagnosis of multiple myeloma with triphenotypic characteristics (kappa alone, lambda alone, and both) was made. After
initial treatment with vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (VAD) regimen, the patient' condition stabilized, and after 1 year's
follow-up he continued treatment with thalidomide alone.
