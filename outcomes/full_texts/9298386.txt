hypertension. The case is reported of a twoyear old girl with a congenital arterioportal fistula, who presented with splenomegaly and
ascites. Colour doppler ultrasound showed a large shunt between the left hepatic artery and a branch of the left portal vein, producing a
reversal of flow in the main portal vein. She was treated by a formal left hemihepatectomy, which has been successful in eliminating the
fistula and its consequent portal hypertension in the long term. The literature regarding arterioportal fistulae and their treatment is
reviewed.
