SUNCT is a rare condition characterised by a short-lasting periorbital pain associated with autonomic symptoms and is usually unresponsive
to pharmacological treatment. We report a case of SUNCT syndrome linked to a pituitary micro-adenoma, with only nocturnal attacks. The
nocturnal levels of prolactin (PRL) were increased, while other hormonal, haematological, serological and biochemical investigations and
levels of PRL did not reveal abnormal findings during the day-time. PRL serum secretion after thyrotropin-releasing hormone test was lower
than nocturnal secretion, but not enough to induce severe attacks. We suggest that in our patient the rise of nocturnal levels of PRL could
have a direct role in the worsening of this headache, perhaps secondarily to an altered regulation of the hypothalamicâ€“hypophysial axis,
however the actual influence of sleep and the interaction between all neurotransmitters and hormones needs to be clarified further.
