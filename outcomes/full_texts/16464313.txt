We report the case of a patient with mild non-obstructive coronary artery disease who sustained an inferior wall myocardial infarction
shortly after taking zolmitriptan as abortive therapy for migraine headaches. A Medline search was performed to review all reported cases of
myocardial infarction related to migraine therapy with zolmitriptan and related medications. Zolmitriptan may cause myocardial infarction
(MI) even in the absence of significant coronary artery disease.
