An 11 year-old girl, whose condition was diagnosed as juvenile-type autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) at five years of
age, presented with chest pain and dyspnea that had developed suddenly two months previously. Two-dimensional echocardiography, Doppler
study and cardiac catheterization confirmed pulmonary hypertension. The underlying mechanism of the diagnosis was not defined. Two and a
half months after the onset of symptoms, the patient died of pulmonary hypertensive crisis. Careful regular checks of cardiopulmonary status
using two-dimensional echocardiography and Doppler should be considered for the early detection of pulmonary hypertension even in an
asymptomatic patient with juvenile-type ARPKD.
