Sjögren's syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the lacrimal and salivary glands, leading
to dryness of eyes (kerato-conjunctivitis sicca) and mouth (xerostomia). The skin lesions in Sjögren's syndrome are usually manifested as
xeroderma, but sometimes appear as annular erythema or vasculitis. Central nervous system symptoms may be presented as one of extraglandular
manifestations, though rare in incidence, and need differential diagnosis from multiple sclerosis. We report a case of a 45-year-old woman
diagnosed as multiple sclerosis at first but later as neurologic manifestation of primary Sjögren's syndrome, showing signs of multiple
sclerosis and cutaneous erythematous lesions.
