Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) using related or unrelated donor could eradicate paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)
clones and may cure the disease. Chronic graft-versus host disease (GVHD) is a major complication of patients who have undergone allo-SCT.
Nephrotic syndrome has been described as one of the rare manifestations of chronic GVHD following the usual myeloablative allo-SCT. We
report a case of nephrotic syndrome that developed 25 months after non-myeloablative allo-SCT for PNH. The patient had grade II acute GVHD
and extensive chronic GVHD after non-myeloablative allo-SCT. Typically the patient presented with preserved renal function and full
nephrotic syndrome including generalized edema, proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Renal biopsy revealed findings of
membranous glomerulopathy (MG). The patient is alive with a stable engraftment and full donor chimerism under the administration of
tacrolimus for control of chronic GVHD and MG without refractory hemolysis and cytopenia.
