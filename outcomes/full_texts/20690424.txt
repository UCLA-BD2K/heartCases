To determine cephalometrically the mechanism of the treatment effects of non-extraction and multiloop edgewise archwire (MEAW) technique on
postpeak Class II Division 1 patients. In this retrospective study, 16 postpeak Class II Division 1 patients successfully corrected using a
non-extraction and MEAW technique were cephalometrically evaluated and compared with 16 matched control subjects treated using an extraction
technique. Using CorelDRAWÂ® software, standardized digital cephalograms pre- and post-active treatments were traced and a reference grid was
set up. The superimpositions were based on the cranial base, the mandibular and the maxilla regions,and skeletal and dental changes were
measured. Changes following treatment were evaluated using the paired-sample t-test. Student's t-test for unpaired samples was used to
assess the differences in changes between the MEAW and the extraction control groups. The correction of the molar relationships comprised
54% skeletal change (mainly the advancement of the mandible) and 46% dental change. Correction of the anterior teeth relationships comprised
30% skeletal change and 70% dental change. The MEAW technique can produce the desired vertical and sagittal movement of the tooth segment
and then effectively stimulate mandibular advancement by utilizing the residual growth potential of the condyle.
