Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is the main cause of humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy (HHM). We recently established a new
human breast cancer cell line, designated KPL-3C, from the malignant effusion of a breast cancer patient with HHM. Morphological,
cytogenetic and immunohistochemical analyses indicated that the cell line is derived from human breast cancer. The KPL-3C cells stably
secrete immunoreactive PTHrP measured by a two-site immunoradiometric assay, possess both oestrogen and progesterone receptors and are
tumorigenic in female nude mice. The addition of phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate to the medium significantly increased PTHrP secretion from
the cells. In contrast, hydrocortisone, medroxyprogesterone acetate and 22-oxacalcitriol decreased PTHrP secretion in a dose-dependent
manner. Unexpectedly, a number of microcalcifications were observed in the transplanted tumours. Radiographical examination indicated that
the microcalcifications in the tumours are very similar to those commonly observed in human breast cancer. These findings suggest that this
KPL-3C cell line may be useful for studying the regulatory mechanisms of PTHrP secretion and the mechanisms that lead to the deposition of
microcalcifications in breast cancer.
