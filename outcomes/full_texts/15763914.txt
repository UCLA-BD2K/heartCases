BACKGROUND: Primary psoas muscle abscess is rare and can be difficult to diagnose, particularly during pregnancy. CASE: To our knowledge,
this is the first case of primary psoas muscle abscess diagnosed during pregnancy. Clinical investigation did not reveal any infection
spreading from adjacent structures. Surgical drainage and simultaneous Cesarean delivery of the infant, combined with appropriate
antibiotics, enabled a cure. CONCLUSION: The possibility of psoas muscle abscess should be taken into account when investigating lower back
pain during pregnancy if conventional approaches are unsatisfactory.
