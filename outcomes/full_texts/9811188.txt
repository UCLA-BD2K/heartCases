We report a 27-year-old woman who developed Coombs' negative hemolytic anemia and fulminant hepatic failure as the initial manifestation of
Wilson's disease. Unmeasurably low level of serum alkaline phosphatase provided a clue to the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. The diagnosis
was established with the presence of Kayser-Fleischer ring, decreased serum ceruloplasmin level, and elevated urine and serum copper levels.
In spite of repeated plasmapheresis, she died of multiorgan failure on the fifth hospital day.
