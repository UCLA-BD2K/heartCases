Weber-Christian disease (WCD) is a rare inflammatory disease of adipose tissue, which is characterized by painful cutaneous nodules and
constitutional symptoms. Although any area of the body containing fat can be affected by WCD, the involvement of retrobulbar fat is uncommon
and proptosis is a rare presenting manifestation. We report a case who presented with proptosis of the right eye which is accompanied by
painful subcutaneous nodules, high fever and myalgia. Biopsies of retrobulbar tissue and suprapubic nodule showed lobular panniculitis with
mixed cellular infiltration, mainly composed of histiocytes and lymphocytes. He responded well to high-dose glucocorticoid.
