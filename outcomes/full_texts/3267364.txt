The aim of this case report is to draw the attention to the occurrence of cystic fibrosis (C.F.) in a Korean infant and thus increase the
awareness for the diagnosis. The male infant was presented with a history of recurrent bronchiolitis manifested by severe cough, wheeze and
dyspnea from three weeks of age, in whom the diagnosis of C.F. was clinically suspected and was confirmed by demonstration of two elevated
sweat chloride levels (97 mEq/L and 99 mEq/L) in the patient. The diagnosis was delayed because the main manifestations of C.F. were the
same as the main symptoms of common diseases such as cough, diarrhea and failure to thrive. C.F. is probably underdiagnosed in Korean
population both because the diagnosis is not considered since the disease is thought to be uncommon or even not to occur and because
diagnostic facilities including the quantitative iontophoresis sweat test are lacking.
