A cluster of 22 imported malaria cases, 21 caused by Plasmodium falciparum, was observed among illegal Chinese immigrants in northern Italy
in the summer of 2000. The rate of severe disease was high because the patients were not immune and they sought health-care services late in
their illness because of their clandestine status. Recognition of the outbreak was delayed because no regional alert system among infectious
diseases hospitals was in place.
