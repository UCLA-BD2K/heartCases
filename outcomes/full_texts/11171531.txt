In 1984, a 56-year-old house painter developed intractable pain in his back and other joints. After several unrevealing medical work-ups, he
was found to have a high blood lead level (122 microg/dL); he has a history of scraping and sanding lead paint without adequate protective
measures. The patient was hospitalized and chelated with EDTA four times over the next 5 years; each time he felt better at the end of his
treatment, but he returned to largely the same working conditions. He developed hypertension in April 1989, underwent a final chelation, and
retired. He was subsequently followed on a regular basis with repeated measurement of lead levels in blood and bone (using a K-x-ray
fluorescence instrument) as well as clinical parameters. In 1995 his blood pressure became difficult to control despite a sequential
increase in his antihypertensive medication dosages and the addition of new medications. In 1997 he began calcium supplementation and a
high-calcium diet; his blood pressure declined markedly, allowing him to taper off of two of his four antihypertensive medications. This
case demonstrates an occupational activity (construction) that has now become the dominant source of lead exposure for U.S. adults, the
importance of a good occupational history to suspecting and making a diagnosis, the possible outcomes of chronic lead toxicity, and the
importance of preventing further exposure and using proper methods to treat acute toxicity. It also highlights a current major etiologic
question, that is, whether and to what degree lead exposure contributes to the development of hypertension, and raises the issue of whether
lead-induced hypertension constitutes a subset of hypertension that is especially amenable to therapy with dietary calcium.
