Metastasis to the eye is rare, it can affect almost all ocular tissues. The association of metastasis to the optic nerve and lens
dislocation in the same orbit is exceptional. We repport a 63 years old man presented with blindness due to a lens dislocation in the left
eye. One month later, he presented a right hemiparesis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing brain and intra orbital metastasis
associated with a lens dislocation. The histological result was provided by a stereotactic biopsy. The eye may be the site of several
lesions to both. A lens dislocation can retarded a diagnosis of the nerve optic metastasis.. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing
metastasis of the optic nerve associated with a lens dislocation
