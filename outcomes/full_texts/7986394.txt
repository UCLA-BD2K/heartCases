Esophageal duplication cysts account for a very small percentage of benign esophageal tumors and are infrequently symptomatic. Esophageal
duplication cysts result from aberrant alignment of the normal vacuolization process that produce the esophageal lumen in the 5th to 8th
week of embryonic life. Complications most often are bleeding into or infection of cysts. Recently, we experienced a case of esophageal
duplication cyst complicated with intramural huge hematoma and the cause of hematoma could not be identified. We report it with a review of
literatures.
