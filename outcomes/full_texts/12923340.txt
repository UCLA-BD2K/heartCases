A 13-yr-old female was admitted to our hospital with fever, seizure, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Laboratory data showed pancytopenia,
elevation of serum transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, triglyceride, and ferritin levels. Lymph node biopsy revealed features of Kikuchi's
disease and there were signs of histiocytosis and hemophagocytic phenomenon in bone marrow. She recovered after treatment with intravenous
immunoglobulin and corticosteroids therapy. Hemophagocytic syndrome can be associated with Kikuchi's disease especially in childhood and
seems to have a less aggressive clinical course and better prognosis.
