We report a case of symptomatic intraurethral prostatic cyst in a 42-yr-old man without clinical evidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia.
The intraurethral cyst makes it unique from the all previously reported cases of prostatic cysts located medially within the prostate.
Transurethral resection of the cyst with limited resection of the prostatic tissue at the base of the cyst was performed with successful
resolution of voiding symptoms.
