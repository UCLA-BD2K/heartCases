A 70-year old woman presented to Haydarpaşa Numune Training and Research Hospital, Urology Department, Istanbul, Turkey, in March 2012, with
haematuria and 10 kg weight loss during the last three months. There was no abnormality seen in the physical examination. Complete blood
count was normal, serum biochemistry profile was within normal limits. Urine (24 h) normetanephrine level was 1160 μg (normal range 92-604
μg). Computered tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed right adrenal 11 × 11 × 10 cm sized mass (Figs 1 and 2). An
adrenal pheochromocytoma was suspected in endocrinological examination. Adrenalectomy was planned for definitive diagnosis and treatment.
The patient was treated with open transperitoneal adrenalectomy in urology clinics. Pathological examination of adrenal revealed diffuse
proliferation of atypical cells with large hyperchromatic nuclei and narrow eosinophilic cytoplasm. In the immunohistochemical study, tumour
cells were positive for CD 20, while CD 5, cyclin D1 and CD 10 were negative. The patient was treated with six cycles of chemotherapy after
operation in the oncology department. She had no recurrence and metastasis now. MRI image of right adrenal tumour the patient. CT image of
adrenal mass the patient. Adrenal lesions are usually metastases from distant organ malignites1. The most common metastases arise from
bronchial carcinomas. Primary adrenal lymphoma is rare2 and adrenal lymphomas are usually bilateral3.
