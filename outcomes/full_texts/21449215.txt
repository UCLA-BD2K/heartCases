One type of soft tissue lesions of the oral cavity is lipoma, which is a kind of benign tumor composed of mature lipid cells. Although the
lipoma presents as one of the most common mesenchymal neoplasms, most tend to develop on the trunk and proximal portions of the extremities.
However, lipomas in the oral and maxillofacial region are much less frequent. Here we present a case of an intraoral lipoma in a six year-
old child.
