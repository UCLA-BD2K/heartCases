Formaldehyde is but one of many chemicals capable of causing the tight building syndrome or environmentally induced illness (EI). The
spectrum of symptoms it may induce includes attacks of headache, flushing, laryngitis, dizziness, nausea, extreme weakness, arthralgia,
unwarranted depression, dysphonia, exhaustion, inability to think clearly, arrhythmia or muscle spasms. The nonspecificity of such symptoms
can baffle physicians from many specialties. Presented herein is a simple office method for demonstrating that formaldehyde is among the
etiologic agents triggering these symptoms. The very symptoms that patients complain of can be provoked within minutes, and subsequently
abolished, with an intradermal injection of the appropriate strength of formaldehyde. This injection aids in convincing the patient of the
cause of the symptoms so he can initiate measures to bring his disease under control.
