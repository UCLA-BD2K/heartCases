Cervical spine manipulation has been associated with several disorders such as cervical arteries dissection, but rarely has a relationship
with intracranial hypotension been reported. We describe a patient showing intracranial hypotension syndrome following chiropractic cervical
spine treatment. Magnetic resonance showed the presence of dural leakage at cervical level, suggesting the pathogenesis of the syndrome. We
state that cervical spine manipulation should be considered a treatment with risk of neurological complications, including the occurrence of
intracranial hypotension.
