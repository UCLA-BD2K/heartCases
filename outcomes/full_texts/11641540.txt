Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging was performed to assess the coronary wall morphology in detail at 22 months after the onset of
Kawasaki disease in a girl who had developed coronary aneurysms at 4 yr of age. The sites of persistent aneurysms demonstrated a dilated
lumen with a marked symmetrical or asymmetrical thickening of the intima-media complex. This pathologic finding was also present in
angiographically normal vessels near an aneurysm but with a mild thickening. Coronary artery calcification was observed at one site in the
aneurysms. The sites of normal coronary artery far from an aneurysm showed normal intravascular ultrasound findings with no measurable
intima-media complex. Our case indicates that the healing process may continue via cell proliferation, with extension to the proximity of
the coronary aneurysms. IVUS is useful to evaluate the coronary wall morphology and may be valuable in the long-term follow-up of coronary
lesions due to Kawasaki disease.
