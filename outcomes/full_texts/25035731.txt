Supervising Section Editor: Sean O. Henderson, MD A 19-year-old man presented to the emergency department complaining of two days of right
arm pain and swelling. The pain started while lifting weights. He did not experience a pop or pulling sensation. He stated his arm felt a
little cold but otherwise denied numbness or tingling. He denied chest pain, neck pain or shortness of breath. Examination demonstrated a
diffusely edematous right upper extremity. Distal pulses were strong and regular. His fingers had a dusky appearance and the entire arm was
cool to touch. Range of motion, motor and sensory exam were normal. Heart and lung exam were normal. A computed tomography (CT) angiogram of
the chest and upper extremity were performed. The chest CT revealed an axillo-subclavian thrombosis (Figure). Upper extremity deep vein
thrombosis (DVT) is extremely rare (approximately 2/100,00 people per year), accounting for only 1 to 4% of all cases of DVT.1 Thoracic
outlet syndrome is a compression of the neurovascular structures in the area superior to the first rib and posterior to the clavicle.
Brachial plexus (95%), subclavian vein (4%), and subclavian artery (1%) are affected. Women more frequently have neurologic thoracic outlet
syndrome (TOS) while men more frequently have venous TOS.4 Paget Schr√∂etter Syndrome is an effort-induced thrombosis of upper extremity.
First defined in 1884, it was described as a thrombosis of the axillary and subclavian veins. It is the leading vascular disorder in
athletes, and males experience it more commonly than females.2,3 Diagnosis and treatment consists of a venous duplex and a confirmatory
venogram.2,3 Catheter directed thrombolysis with subsequent first rib removal is recommended to produce the best results.2,3 Oral
anticoagulation is generally recommended for 3 to 6 months. Full text available through open access at

The authors disclosed none. Computed tomography angiogram chest reveals a thrombosis of the right subclavian and axillary veins with subtle
filling defect at the junction of the right subclavian, jugular and brachiocephalic veins (red arrow).
