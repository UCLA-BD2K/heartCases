We report a case of simultaneous contralateral renal transitional cell carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. A 63-yr-old male presented with
hematuria. He was diagnosed with left renal pelvis tumor and contralateral renal cell carcinoma. Subsequently, the patient received left
nephrectomy and paraaortic lymphadenectomy (transitional cell carcinoma, pT3N2M0). Post-operatively, chemotherapy of renal pelvis tumor and
angioinfarction of contralateral renal cell carcinoma are being considered. We believe that management planning should be individualized in
such cases.
