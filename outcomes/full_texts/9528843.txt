Two patients with proven 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-associated cardiotoxicity were treated with the specific thymidylate synthase inhibitor
raltitrexed safely, without evidence of cardiotoxicity. Raltitrexed might be an alternative for patients with advanced colorectal cancer and
5-FU-associated cardiotoxicity. 5-FU cardiotoxicity is not due to the antineoplastic mechanisms via thymidilate synthase.
