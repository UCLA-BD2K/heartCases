Meningioangiomatosis is a rare benign hamartomatous lesion. We describe a case of meningioangiomatosis in an 18-year-old boy with a 15 year
history of seizures. Computed tomography reveals an irregular calcification density along the right temporal gyrus. Microscopically,
irregularly branched blood vessels, surrounded by a concentric arrangement of proliferating spindle cells, are extending into the gray
matter from the meningeal surface. Ultrastructural and immunohistochemical examination failed to demonstrate features of meningothelial cell
origin in this case. This is the first case of meningioangiomatosis published in Korea along with immunohistochemical and electron
microscopic studies. The pathogenesis and previous reports of this lesion will be discussed.
