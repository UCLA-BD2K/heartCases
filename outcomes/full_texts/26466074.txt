Potential Conflict of Interest No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported. A follow-up transesophageal
echocardiography (TEE) was performed on a 76-year-old woman with a recent history of mitral valve endocarditis after 4 weeks of antibiotic
treatment. TEE showed a pulsatile perivalvular echo-free space of 32 × 23 mm with a narrow orifice which communicated to the left ventricle
at the posterior mitral subannular position consistent with the pseudoaneurysm (Panel A). The real-time three-dimensional TEE allowed us to
see its relationship with the neighboring structures (Panels B and C). Subsequently, a coronary CT angiogram confirmed these findings and
revealed no significant coronary stenosis (Panels D and E). Therefore, surgery was indicated and a bovine pericardium patch was implanted
with good results. Sources of Funding This study was funded by ABBOT Diagnósticos do Brasil. Study Association This study is not associated
with any thesis or dissertation work. A. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showing a pulsatile perivalvular echo-free space of 32 × 23
mm corresponding with a basal inferior pseudoaneurysm (PA). B, C. Real-time 3D TEE showing PA and its relationship with adjacent structures.
D. A 3D volume-rendered cardiac CT angiogram showing PA and coronary arteries. E. Maximum intensity pixel projection reconstruction using a
short axis view at the level of the mitral valve showing PA. Note the severe mitral annular calcification (arrow).
