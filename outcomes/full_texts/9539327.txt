A case of ovarian sex cord tumor with annular tubules (SCTAT) in a 24-year old woman with Turner syndrome is presented. Close association of
dysgenetic gonads and gonadoblastoma has been clearly documented, and there have been sporadic reports of patients with other gonadal
tumors. To our knowledge, a case of SCTAT in a patient with 45,X/46,XX Turner syndrome has not been reported. On the basis of
histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural findings, we suggest that the SCTAT originated from pluripotential stem cells of
the gonads and differentiated into either granulosa cells or Sertoli cells. We postulate a possible relationship between the SCTAT and
gonadoblastoma based on the morphologic resemblance and occurrence in dysgenetic gonads.
