An autopsy case of disseminated HSV type 2 infection occurring in a neonate at 32 weeks' gestation, delivered by cesarean section after
premature rupture of membrane of 7 days duration, is presented. Herpes simplex virus type 2 was isolated from the vesicular skin lesion. The
mother and patient had specific antibody to type 2 herpes simplex virus. Patient's parents had denied any herpetic orolabial or genital
lesion during or before this pregnancy. Cultures from the cervical and vaginal swabs of the mother were negative for HSV. Postmortem
examination showed hepatic necrosis, skin vesicle, devastating necrotizing inflammation of the brain, chorioretinitis and interstitial
pneumonitis.
