Drug overdoses in general are increasing and overdoses of cardiac medications are also increasing; some are associated with a high
mortality. Temporary cardiac pacing has a valuable role in cases of hypotension related to dysrhythmia, or when it is necessary to provide
overdrive pacing. However, despite technically successful and uncomplicated pacemaker insertion and restoration of cardiac electrical
activity, patients developing bradyarrhythmia and hypotension after an overdose are in a high risk group.
