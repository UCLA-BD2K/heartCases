A case of pancreatic carcinoma with both acinar and endocrine features is presented. The patient was a 52-year-old female presenting with
jaundice of 3 weeks' duration. The tumor was a 6 x 6 cm-sized round solid mass in the head of pancreas, invading the superior mesenteric
vein. Histologically, it was composed of monotonous ovoid cells with eosinophilic granular cytoplasm in solid nests and sheets with
occasional acinar and glandular differentiation. Immunohistochemical study revealed coexpression of acinar and endocrine markers; amylase,
chromogranin, neuron-specific enolase, glucagon, somatostatin, and gastrin in tumor cells. This is the first documented case of mixed
acinar-endocrine carcinoma of the pancreas in Korea, and its amphicrine nature reflects a close histogenetic relationship between pancreatic
exocrine and endocrine cells.
