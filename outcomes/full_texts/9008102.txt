We report two cases of lipoma of the parotid gland which present as a non-tender, freely movable and intraparotid mass. Lipomas are common
soft tissue neoplasms but found very rarely in the parotid gland, and so are often not considered in the initial differential diagnosis of
parotid gland tumor. We believe that these tumors are cured by simple excision, and thus superficial parotidectomy is enough for treatment.
