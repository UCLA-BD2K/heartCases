On June 26, 1983, at laparotomy, no resection was attempted because the lesion involved the right lobe of the liver and a part of segments
II and III. The patient underwent a right hepatic arterial embolisation with gelatine sponge particles. During follow-up, the patient
remained asymptomatic. Five-year review by CT-scan showed a diminution of the size of the haemangioma and hypertrophy of the left lobe. On
October 21, 1988, the patient was reoperated on for liver abscess and complete necrosis of the haemangioma. A right hepatectomy was
performed. In conclusion, the long-term effect of hepatic arterial embolisation, as demonstrated in our case by regular CT-scans, is useful
in cases of diffuse haemangioma as an alternative to hazardous major liver resection. To our knowledge, the long-term effect of hepatic
arterial embolisation on symptoms and tumor size have never been reported for giant liver haemangioma.
