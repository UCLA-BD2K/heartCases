As of December 1986, we have identified 23 symptomatic children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in New Haven. Twelve
developed AIDS as manifested by lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), and/or disseminated
mycobacterial infections; seven of them have died. The remainder have milder clinical syndromes, which include failure to thrive, diffuse
lymphadenopathy, and parotid swelling. When compared to adults with AIDS, children often have hypergammaglobulinemia and normal numbers of
T4 lymphocytes. Intravenous drug abuse by the mother or mother's consort is the risk factor in 87 percent of these children. Two families
have now been identified with more than one symptomatic child, but in no family is there evidence of spread from symptomatic children to
uninfected siblings. A prospective study was begun to attempt to assess the risk of developing symptomatic HIV infection when a child is
born to a mother with antibodies to HIV.
