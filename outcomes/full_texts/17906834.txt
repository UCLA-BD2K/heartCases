Coexistence of hemifacial spasm (HFS) and trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a rare entity known as painful tic convulsif (PTC). Here, we present
a case of right-sided HFS after which left TN developed, which is an unusual form of PTC. Both disorders were caused by bilateral vascular
compression of the cranial nerves and successfully treated with botulinum toxin and carbamazepine. As PTC is benign in nature and can be
treated with botulinum toxin, neuroradiological investigations should be performed for an accurate aetiological diagnosis, particularly in
young patients with atypical disease manifestations.
