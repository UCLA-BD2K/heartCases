“Open book fracture” is rare. It is one of the most dangerous pelvic fractures. It is usually associated with abdominal, vascular and
nervous injuries requiring a multidisciplinary team for its management. Its treatment is mainly surgical. Only some cases are published in
recent literature. The mechanism is usually complex and the consequences usually dramatic. We report in this case a very rare image of an
open book fracture which occurred in a young thirty old man. He was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital after a work
accident. He was hit by a heavy (500 kg) charge in his back with impact to the groin in the manufactory where he works. He was transferred
by a non-medical transfer to our emergency department. At initial examination, he had a deformed pelvis with moderate bleeding. We observed
a large hematoma in his back. The standard pelvis radio X ray (A) revealed a disruption of the pelvic ring with a “third fragment”. Pelvic
CT scan showed this third fragment (B). There was a complete fracture of the right iliac wing with a sacroiliac joint disruption. The right
and the left halves of the pelvis are separated at front and rear. The front was opening more than the rear. It seemed like an open book and
it is called “open book” pelvic fracture. The patient was managed initially in the emergency room with fluid challenge and analgesia. He had
then urgent multidisciplinary surgery with external fixation with a good outcome. A) pelvis radio X ray showing a complete fracture of the
