This was an 84-year-old male patient, with worsening functional class from NYHA III/IV to IV/IV and palpitations. No syncope. Physical
examination revealed bradycardia, the rest was uneventful. Electrocardiogram showed Mobitz II atrioventricular block. Patient was scheduled
for permanent pacemaker implantation. Subclavian vein access was performed via direct puncture. The guide wire was advanced, entered the
subclavian vein and descended parallel to the spine without crossing over to the right side. Subsequently, the guide wire traversed the
coronary sinus and ended in the right atrium. Persistent left superior vena cava was diagnosed. During fluoroscopic observation, another
feature that aids in the diagnosis is left paravertebral shadow above the aortic bow. The electrode was initially introduced with a straight
guide reaching into the right atrium (RA). Afterwards, the straight guide was replaced by a conventional J guide and the electrode was
pushed towards the anterolateral wall of the RA. The electrode tip was thus lying against the tricuspid valve. Subsequently, the guide was
withdrawn 3 cm. The guide withdrawal, without moving the electrode, is associated with the passage of the electrode through the tricuspid
valve. The electrode was advanced and finally the active fixation mechanism was deployed1. Author contributions Conception and design of the
