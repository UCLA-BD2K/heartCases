A 23-year-old man with a 5-year history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and who was in remission after chemotherapy treatment
presenting with a shoulder mass (Figs. 1–4). Fig. 1Sagittal oblique T1-weighted fast spin echo image with chemical fat saturation and
intravenous gadolinium reveals heterogeneous enhancement of a mass within the infrascapular region (arrow)Fig. 2The tumor was composed of
short, intersecting fascicles of spindle cells with scattered small lymphocytes (original magnification, ×400)Fig. 3At high power, the
majority of tumor cells demonstrated fusiform pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and elongated, blunt-ended nuclei (original magnification, ×400).
These cells were strongly positive for the smooth muscle marker h-caldesmon by immunohistochemistry (not shown)Fig. 4In situ hybridization
for the LANA gene showed expression in smooth muscle cells and lymphocytes (original magnification, ×200) Sagittal oblique T1-weighted fast
