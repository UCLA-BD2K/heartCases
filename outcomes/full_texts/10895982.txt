Isolated splenic metastasis arising from colorectal carcinoma is very rare and there has been only 6 cases reported in the English
literature. A new case is presented, and its possible pathogenesis was considered with previously reported cases. A 65-year-old male patient
had received a right hemicolectomy for ascending colon cancer 36 months earlier. He was followed up regularly with serial measurement of
serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Rising serum CEA was discovered from 33 months postoperatively and CT revealed an isolated splenic
metastasis. He therefore underwent splenectomy, which was proven to be a metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar histological feature to the
original tumor. As all reported cases showed elevated serum CEA at the time of metastasis, isolated splenic metastasis might be associated
with CEA in regard to its biological functions of immunosuppression and adhesion.
