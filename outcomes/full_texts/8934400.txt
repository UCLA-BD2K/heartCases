A rare case of gastric cancer associated with gastrojejunal and gastrocolic fistula is presented. A 56-year-old man who had been diagnosed
with advanced gastric cancer(Borrmann's type III) 5 months previously was admitted due to watery diarrhea and frequent vomiting for 2 weeks.
Fluoroscopic examination was visualized two abnormal passage of contrast medium from the stomach, one to the colon, and the other to the
jejunum. Gastrofiberscopy revealed that the tumor on the great curvature of the body appeared to penetrate into the colon, while the other
one on the antrum directly invaded into the jejunum. The patient was treated conservatively with total parenteral nutrition and pain
control.
