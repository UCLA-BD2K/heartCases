The authors report a typical case of tenosynovial giant cell tumor of the right middle finger of a 31-year-old man. Histologically, this
tumor is characterized by a discrete proliferation of rounded synovial-like cells accompanied by a variable number of multinucleated giant
cells, inflammatory cells, and xanthoma cells. Clinicopathologically, this tumor is a benign lesion that nonetheless possesses a capacity
for local recurrence. Local excision with a small cuff of normal tissue is the treatment of choice in this tumor.
