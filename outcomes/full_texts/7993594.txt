A 67-year-old man, diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma by percutaneous needle aspiration biopsy of liver mass, presented microangiopathic
hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal failure from the early phase of the illness. We could establish the diagnosis of cancer-
associated hemolytic uremic syndrome which was unrelated to chemotherapy clinically. This is a rare case reported in adult hepatoma
patients.
