A case of lymphoepithelial carcinoma occurring in the left submandibular salivary gland is presented. Histologic features of this rare
malignancy are described in detail. This unusual carcinoma has been described frequently in Eskimos and is usually located in the parotid
gland. The raised serum IgG to Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen suggests a causal relationship between Epstein-Barr virus and this type of
salivary gland carcinoma.
