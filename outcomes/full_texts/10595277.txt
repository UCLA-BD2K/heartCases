The counselling experience with 50 Flemish families in whom mutation analysis of the total coding region of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene has
been initiated, is presented. Genetic testing for breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility is offered by a multidisciplinary team. During the
counselling sessions, special attention is given to comprehensible and emotionally acceptable communi-cation of genetic information and to
the psychosocial evaluation of the counselee. The limitations of molecular testing and the controversy surrounding cancer prevention
strategies are also discussed. The overall acceptance of mutation testing is high. Some of the problems encountered are inaccuracy of the
reported family history, poor retrieval of the medical records of affected family members and the reluctance of many patients to inform
their relatives about the possibility of being tested.
