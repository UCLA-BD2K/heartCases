The work of the Viral Diagnostic Laboratory at Yale-New Haven Hospital has been continuously inspired by the virologic and epidemiologic
principles taught us by Dr. Horstmann. This paper helps to define the various functions of this facility. Perhaps its most important role is
as a learning laboratory where generations of students, fellows, house officers, and teachers are taught how viruses behave in the human
host and in the community.
