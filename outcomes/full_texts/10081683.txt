A Staphylococcus aureus isolate with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin was obtained from a dialysis patient with a fatal case of
bacteremia. Comparison of the isolate with two methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolated obtained from the same patient 4 months
earlier suggests that the S. aureus with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin emerged from the MRSA strain with which the patient was
infected. Atypical phenotypic characteristics, including weak or negative latex-agglutination test results, weak or negative-slide coagulase
test results, heterogeneous morphologic features, slow rate of growth, and vancomycin susceptibility (by disk diffusion test) were observed.
