The use of nitrate-contaminated drinking water to prepare infant formula is a well-known risk factor for infant methemoglobinemia. Affected
infants develop a peculiar blue-gray skin color and may become irritable or lethargic, depending on the severity of their condition. The
condition can progress rapidly to cause coma and death if it is not recognized and treated appropriately. Two cases of blue baby syndrome
were recently investigated. Both cases involved infants who became ill after being fed formula that was reconstituted with water from
private wells. Water samples collected from these wells during the infants' illnesses contained nitrate-nitrogen concentrations of 22.9 and
27.4 mg/L.
