carcinoma around the major hepatic duct confluence arising after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) due to initial bile duct carcinoma are described
in three patients. Occurrence of biliary carcinoma more than 12 years after initial surgery and a histological finding of cholangiocellular
carcinoma mixed with hepatocellular carcinoma suggested metachronous incidence of biliary carcinoma after PD. Extended right hemihepatectomy
with complete removal of the residual extrahepatic bile duct and segmental, resection of the jejunal loop were carried out safely without
operative death or severe postoperative complications. Two patients died of tumor recurrence 6 months after surgery, and the remaining
patient is currently living a normal life without evidence of recurrence 17 months after surgery. These surgical procedures are a
therapeutic option in patients with biliary carcinoma around the major hepatic duct confluence arising after PD.
