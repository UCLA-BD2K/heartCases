We report a case of leukemia cutis with atypical skin manifestations, presented with generalized various sized dark brownish to erythematous
patches with plaques on the whole body of a 42-year-old man. Skin lesions developed 6 months ago and had no signs of itching or tenderness.
He complained of sustaining fevers with abdominal discomfort. Laboratory findings showed elevation of leukocyte count and peripheral blood
smear revealed 86% of lymphocyte. Histologic examination showed diffuse infiltration of abnormal cells that appeared to be leukemic in
nature.
