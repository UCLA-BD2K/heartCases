Cystic carcinoid tumors of the pancreas represent a subgroup of malignant potential and difficult diagnosis.(1,2) Endoscopic ultrasound-
guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is an effective tool to evaluate these lesions.(1–4) A 52-year old man was referred to the Hospital
Israelita Albert Einstein to investigate a pancreatic cyst. Endoscopic ultrasound revealed a cystic lesion, measuring 2cm in the pancreatic
tail, without septations and communication with the pancreatic duct (Figures 1 and 2). The FNA fluid showed normal amylase (67U/L) and low
CEA (11,2ng/mL) levels. Histological examination of fragments of the cystic wall obtained by FNA (Figure 3) revealed a carcinoid tumor,
confirmed by chromogranin and synaptofisin immunohistochemistry analyses (Figure 4). The preoperative diagnosis of cystic pancreatic
carcinoid tumor is important due to their malignant potential and possibility of ressection.(5) Computed tomography (CT) and EUS may not
help making diagnosis, since the radiological aspect is often interpreted as a pancreatic mucinous cystadenoma, such as in this report. EUS-
FNA is a highly accurate method to diagnose pancreatic carcinoid tumors.(2–4) The few studies available show a high agreement between
cytology and pathology.(2–4) In this report a rare lesion is described, and the diagnosis was possible only after the histological study of
the cystic wall fragments obtained by EUS-FNA. This case report shows the efficacy of EUS-FNA in an unusual diagnosis.
