We report two cases of gingival plasma cell granuloma in a 34-yr-old and 40-yr-old two male renal transplant recipients with cyclosporine A
(CsA)-induced gingival overgrowth (GO). Histologically, these lesions were composed of mature plasma cells, showing polyclonality for both
lambda and kappa light chains and fibrovascular connective tissue stroma. In addition to the fact that CsA-induced plasma cell granuloma is
rare, the salient features of our cases were the secretion of interleukin-6 and overexpression of phospholipase C- gamma 1 of the tumor
cells, which may explain the mechanisms of CsA- induced GO.
