We report two colorectal trauma patients whose rectosigmoid region was ruptured due to a jet of compressed air directed to their anus while
they were playing practical jokes with their colleagues in their place of work. It was difficult to diagnose in one patient due to vague
symptoms and signs and due to being stunned by a stroke of the compressed air. Both patients suffered from abdominal pain and distension,
tension pneumoperitoneum and mild respiratory alkalosis. One patient was treated with primary two layer closure, and the other with primary
two layer closure and sigmoid loop colostomy. Anorectal manometry and transanal ultrasonography checked 4 weeks after surgery, revealed
normal anorectal function and anatomy. The postoperative courses were favorable without any wound infection or intraabdominal sepsis.
