The literature on strategies of investigative psychotherapy of schizophrenia is selectively reviewed, and a case history is presented. The
format is modelled on the authors' research technique of contrasting theory with practice. While long-term observation of single cases does
not address cause and effect, descriptions of cases with a variety of known outcomes can help to build a typology of treatment processes.
