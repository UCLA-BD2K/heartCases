Hypernatremia developing in nonhospitalized adults is predominantly a disease of the elderly and mentally handicapped patients, possibly
revealing inadequate nursing care of these patients. It has long been claimed that the duration of hypernatremia and its rate of correction
are correlated with improvement in patients' neurologic status. Since there are only a handful of cases with serum sodium levels greater
than 200 mEq/L until recently, it is not clear at what rate plasma sodium concentration can be safely normalized in severe hypernatremic
patients. We report a case of severe hypernatremia with survival. This patient underwent rapid correction of serum sodium concentration
during the management of this metabolic derangement using isotonic solution.
