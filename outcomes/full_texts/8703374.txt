Lymphadenopathy is a relatively uncommon finding of minimally differentiated acute myelogenous leukemia (AML-MO). We experienced a case of
AML-MO in a 57-year-old man initially presented with multiple cervical lymphadenopathy. Bone marrow aspiration revealed myeloblasts, which
were negative for myeloperoxidase, Sudan black B, Periodic acid-Schiff, non-specific esterase and double esterase reaction. In cell surface
marker studies, CD13, CD14, CD33, CD34, CD45 and HLA-DR were present. CT scan of neck demonstrated multiple lymphadenopathy at both internal
jugular chains, spinal accessory chains and submandibular area. He died about two weeks after diagnosis without specific treatment.
