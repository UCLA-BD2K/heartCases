shock and intense anemia (Hemoglobin 04.7 g/dl), and was operated on. A bleeding retroperitoneal varix located near the right colon was
responsible for the clinical picture and was sutured. After operation the patient developed haemodynamic instability and pneumonia a
situation which was reverted with intensive medical therapy. The patient is now doing well.
