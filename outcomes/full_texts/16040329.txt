BACKGROUND: We report a case of symptomatic actinomycosis associated with vaginal suture erosion and granulation tissue refractory to
conservative management, in an outpatient setting. CASE: Three months after total vaginal hysterectomy and uterosacral ligament vaginal
vault suspension, a woman complained of painless, intermittent vaginal discharge and spotting. Despite cauterization of granulation tissue,
vaginal spotting persisted for another month. On re-examination, braided polyester suture that was found underlying the granulation tissue
was removed. Recurrent symptoms, together with a biopsy revealing actinomycetes, prompted a trial of oral penicillin VK. With persistent
symptoms and discomfort during attempts in the outpatient clinic, the woman eventually required suture removal in the operating room. Her
symptoms subsequently resolved without recurrence, and no further antibiotic treatment was required. CONCLUSIONS: Actinomyces may be
associated with persistent granulation tissue and vault suspension suture material. In rare circumstances, when tissue debridement and
suture removal in the clinic is unsatisfactory, surgical intervention in the operating room may be necessary. Ten days of antibiotic therapy
alone did not eradicate the granulation tissue, and symptoms resolved only after complete removal of the underlying permanent suture.
