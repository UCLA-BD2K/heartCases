Orthognathic surgery is frequently accompanied by intermaxillary fixation. Intermaxillary fixation impedes the maintenance of effective oral
hygiene and prolonged fixation can result in periodontal disease. A potential shorter term effect is the generation of oral malodour. It is
unclear, however, as to how the production of malodorous compounds in the oral cavity is altered post-surgery. Oral air concentration of
sulphur containing compounds, short chain organic acids, ammonia, isoprene and acetone were measured using selected ion flow tube-mass
spectrometry in a patient who had undergone orthognathic surgery with subsequent intermaxillary fixation. Total sulphide levels rose
approximately 5-fold during fixation with metal ties, with smaller increases recorded for the other compounds measured with the exception of
isoprene which remained close to baseline levels. Organic acid levels declined markedly once elastic ties had replaced metal ties, with a
lesser reduction being observed in sulphide levels, with both declining further after the commencement of a chlorhexidine-containing
mouthwash. These data suggest that bacterial generation of a variety of malodorous compounds increases markedly following intermaxillary
fixation. This single case also suggests that the use of elastic ties and effective oral hygiene techniques, including the use of
chlorhexidine mouthwash, may help ameliorate such post-surgical effects.
