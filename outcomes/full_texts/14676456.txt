Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid rarely manifests itself as a distant metastatic lesion, and, when present, is usually found in flat
bones. A soft tissue metastasis is extremely rare, and synchronous metastases to the bone and soft tissue is not reported in the literature
so far. We report such a case of a 42-yr-old male, who presented with a goiter, scalp and forearm soft tissue swellings, and, fine needle
aspiration cytology of all these swellings revealed a follicular neoplasm. A wide excision of the forearm swelling was carried out and the
histopathology was consistent with features of metastatic follicular carcinoma of the thyroid. The main stay of treatment is surgical
resection of the primary tumor. The various modalities of treatment of metastasis is discussed with a review of literature.
