Giant-cell interstitial Pneumonia (GIP) is a very uncommon respiratory disease. The majority of cases of GIP are caused by exposure to
cobalt, tungsten and other hard metals. In this report, we describe GIP in a patient who worked in gas station and dealt in propane gas
vessels. He presented with clinical features of chronic interstitial lung disease and underwent an open lung biopsy that showed DIP-like
reaction with large numbers of intra-alveolar macrophages and numerous large, multinucleated histiocytes which were admixed with the
macrophages. Analysis of lung tissue for hard metals was done. Cobalt was the main component of detected hard metals. Corticosteroid therapy
was started and he recovered fully.
