Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a rare syndrome defined by postural headache, associated with a low cerebrospinal fluid
pressure, without history of previous dural trauma or invasive treatment on rachis. We reported a case of a patient with postural headache
caused by SIH identified by magnetic resonance images and treated with saline solution infusion with complete remission of symptoms.
