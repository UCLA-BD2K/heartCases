We report a 51-year-old Vietnam War veteran with an unusual variant of macular amyloidosis presenting as poikilodermatous skin lesions. The
extensive mottled brown pigmentation was checkered with small hypopigmented or normal skin-colored spots and intermingled with
telangiectasia. Skin biopsy revealed subepidermal amyloid deposits. There was no evidence of extracutaneous involvements. This case could be
easily confused with other true poikiloderma lesions.
