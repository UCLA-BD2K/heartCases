Acute dissection of the aorta can be one of the most dramatic of cardiovascular emergencies. Its symptoms can occur abruptly and progress
rapidly. Prompt recognition and appropriate intervention is crucial. However, not all aortic dissections present with classic symptoms of
abrupt chest, back, or abdominal pain, and the diagnosis may be missed. Aortic dissection presenting as a sore throat is quite unusual. A
53-year-old man presented with sore throat as the early symptom of an acute thoracic aortic dissection. Unfortunately, the diagnosis was
delayed, and the patient died. Given the high morbidity and mortality after delayed recognition or misdiagnosis, aortic dissection should be
considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with sore throat and normal findings of neck and throat, even when there is
no classic symptoms.
