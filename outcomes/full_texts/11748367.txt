Preoperative uterine artery embolization and cervical evacuation as conservative management of cervical pregnancy has been tried in recent
years. However, cervical suturing, vasoconstrictor injection, or cervical ballooning was frequently used as an ancillary measures in those
procedures in most of the previous studies. We report two cases of cervical pregnancy that were successfully treated with preoperative
uterine artery embolization and removal of gestational material without ancillary procedures. Our therapeutic modality seems to be safe and
effective for conservative management of cervical pregnancy.
