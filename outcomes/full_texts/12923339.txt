We report a case of ruptured mycotic aneurysm involving innominate artery requiring an urgent surgical treatment. A 62-yr-old woman
presented with fever and dyspnea. Previously, she was diagnosed with colon cancer and received right hemicolectomy and one cycle of adjuvant
chemotherapy. On echocardiogram, pericardial effusion was noted and emergency pericardiocentesis was performed. CT scan revealed aortic
aneurysm involving ascending aorta and innominate artery, and thrombi surrounding those structures. Patch repair of the defect in the
ascending aorta and ringed Goretex graft to bypass the innominate and ascending aorta were performed. We believe that this is the first case
of ruptured mycotic aneurysm involving innominate artery.
