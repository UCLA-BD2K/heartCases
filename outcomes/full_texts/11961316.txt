Aortoesophageal fistula is a rare and lethal disorder that may result from primary diseases of aorta or esophagus, aortic bypass graft,
ingestion of foreign body, trauma, surgical procedure or instrumentation. Tuberculous fistula is extremely rare. We present a 27-yr-old
female patient with aortoesophageal fistula associated with tuberculous mediastinitis. The patient experienced massive hematemesis and
esophagoscopy revealed a small mucosal defect with exudate-coated blood vessel like Dieulafoy 's lesion on about 25 cm from the incisor
teeth. Despite two sessions of endoscopic hemostatic procedures, active massive hemorrhage recurred and was controlled effectively with a
prompt insertion of Sengstaken-Blakemore tube. The patient underwent open thoracotomy, which revealed aortoesophageal fistula. Numerous
white-yellowish, millet seed-like tubercles were scattered in pleural and abdominal cavity. Division of fistular tract and esophageal
resection with Ivor-Lewis anastomosis were performed. Histopathologic study confirmed tuberculous pleuritis and peritonitis. The patient
died of postoperative pulmonary complication.
