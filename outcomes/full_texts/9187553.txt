advanced renal cell carcinoma with concomitant resection of a solitary metastasis in the right lung. Ten years later, he presented with
haematochezia caused by a tumour in the tail of pancreas, invading the transverse colon and the greater curvature of the stomach. The tumour
was radically resected, and histological examination revealed a solitary metastasis of the previous renal cell carcinoma. This case
illustrates a rare indication for pancreatic resection because of pancreatic metastasis.
