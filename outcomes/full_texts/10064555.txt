A growing body of evidence has implicated allergens derived from cockroaches as an important environmental factor that may aggravate asthma
in sensitized persons. We present the case of a 30-year-old man with asthma and a cockroach allergy. Allergy skin testing confirmed
hypersensitivity to cockroach extract, and a home visit revealed visual evidence of infestation and the presence of Bla g 1 German cockroach
allergen in vacuumed dust. As is typical of patients with a cockroach allergy and asthma, multiple factors in addition to cockroach allergen
appeared to aggravate the patient's asthma. A multimodality therapeutic regimen, which included medications as well as cleaning of the home,
integrated pest management, and professional application of chemical controls, resulted in substantial clinical improvement. The
pathophysiology, epidemiology, and clinical features of cockroach-allergic asthma are reviewed, and an approach to diagnosis and management
is suggested.
