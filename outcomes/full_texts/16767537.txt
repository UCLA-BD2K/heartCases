Triptans are specific agonists of the serotonergic 5-HT1B/1D receptors that have increasingly been used in the treatment of migraine and
cluster headaches. Though they are generally considered safe, there have been a few reports of myocardial infarction and stroke associated
with triptan use. We report a patient who developed spontaneous splenic infarction after the use of sumatriptan for the treatment of
migraine headache.
