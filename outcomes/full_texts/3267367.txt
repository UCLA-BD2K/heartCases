A human case of intestinal metagonimiasis that was incidentally found during the histological examination of a resected segment of jejunum
was described. The small adults trematode of Metagonimus yokogawai were found free in jejunal lumen as well as impacted in intervillous
spaces. Histologically intestinal lesions were massive lymphoplasmacytic and eosinophilic infiltration in stroma, erosion of neanby
enterocytes, goblet cell depletion and occasional villous edema. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the worm of spatulate appearance with
rake-shaped tegumental spines. By transmission electron microscopy, the syncytial integument with dense discoidal bodies, basement membrane
muscle cells and subtegumental cells were observed. Characteristic junctional complex was demonstrated between subtegumental and parenchymal
cells as well as between parenchymal cells.
