discovered incidentally after laparoscopic cholecystectomy who subsequently developed abdominal wall recurrence at the epigastric exit port,
and axillary lymph node metastases. Possible preventative steps for tumour dissemination and a management plan if incidental carcinoma is
diagnosed is discussed. The use of a non-porous retrieval bag, early recognition of the carcinoma and excision of the exit wound are
advocated.
