Adult intussusception is rare, and the majority of cases has an underlying cause that requires surgical resection. We report a case of a 39
yr-old man with ileo-ileo-colic intussusception caused by ileal lipoma that was successfully managed by a laparoscopic-assisted surgical
maneuver. Using a three-cannula technique, ileo-colic intussusception was reduced laparoscopically. Then, through a 4-cm transverse incision
in the right lower quadrant abdomen, ileo-ileal intussusception was reduced manually, and a resection of the tumor-bearing ileal segment and
end-to-end anastomosis was performed extracorporeally. Although the role of laparoscopy in managing intussusception is not clearly defined,
laparoscopy may be an alternative approach to the surgical treatment of adult intussusception in selected cases.
