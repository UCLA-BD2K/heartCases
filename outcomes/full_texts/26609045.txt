A 51 year old man presented to the department of Dermatology, Regional University Hospital of Mαlaga, Mαlaga, Spain, in May 2013, with
remarkable lesions on the perineal, perianal and gluteal regions reaching the top of the lower limbs, which he had first noted two years
earlier. The physical examination revealed large erythematous-brownish plaques with a granulomatous appearance, polypoid lesions and areas
of ulceration (Fig. 1). For the past five years, he had been treated for perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease with infliximab, though the
patient admitted poor adherence. Skin biopsy demonstrated the presence of non-caseating granulomas in the dermis (Fig. 2) and did not show
picture suggestive of cutaneous tuberculosis (pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia or neutrophilic microabcesses in the epidermis). In
addition, Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture and serum QuantiFERON® TB Gold were negative. The patient was diagnosed to have metastatic
Crohn's disease which is an uncommon complication of Crohn's disease. He was treated unsuccessfully, with different therapies
(metronidazole, topical and oral tacrolimus and infliximab plus methotrexate) due to the poor treatment adherence of the patient. Large and
erythematous-brownish plaques with a granulomatous appearance on the perineal, perianal and gluteal regions reaching the top of the lower
limbs (arrows). Histological study (hematoxilin and eosin stain) showed the presence of non-caseating granulomas in the dermis (arrow).
