Emphysematous cystitis is characterized by gas collection within the bladder wall and lumen. We report two cases of emphysematous cystitis
of the urinary bladder in a 67-year-old and a 63-year-old women. They presented with bladder irritation symptoms such as dysuria, hematuria
and frequency. Urinalysis showed pyuria. Cystoscopic examination revealed that bladder mucosa was studded with vesicles varying in size and
arranged in clumps. CT scans of the pelvis showed mottled gas bubbles within the bladder. They were treated with antibiotics. Four days
after the treatment, the symptoms subsided and plain abdominal film showed no evidence of gas shadows in the pelvic cavity.
