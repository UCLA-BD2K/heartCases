Short rib-polydactyly syndrome (SRPS) is a group of lethal skeletal dysplasia of an autosomal recessive inheritance characterized by
markedly narrow ribs, micromelia, and multiple anomalies of major organs. We report a case of type IV SRPS with uncommon associations of
polydactyly and bilateral polycystic kidneys, in a 28 week old female fetus. She was born dead to a 28 year old mother, showing a hydropic
change, narrow thorax, and shortened limbs with postaxial heptasyndactyly of both hands and feet. Radiologic examination revealed short
horizontal ribs, curved short tubular limb bones, small ilia and scapula, and a mild vertebral abnormality. Postmortem examination disclosed
pulmonary hypoplasia, pancreatic cysts, hepatic fibrosis, and left persistent superior vena cava. In addition this case had bilateral huge
polycystic renal dysplasia that was seldom described in any type of SRPS. Histologic sections of the vertebrae disclosed abnormal enchondral
ossification with irregular and retarded hypertrophic zone.
