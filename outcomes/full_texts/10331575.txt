We report a 54-year-old male patient who developed an unusual form of generalized drug eruption. He had pain and breathlessness on the left
chest wall. He had history of taking several drugs at private clinics under a diagnosis of herpes zoster. Two weeks later he had a
generalized skin eruption. Examination showed multiple variable sized, mild pruritic, erythematous macules and papules on the face and upper
extremities. Skin lesions take the form of a clinically consistent with disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP).
Methylprednisolone 16 mg, astemisole 10 mg, oxatomide 60 mg was prescribed. Topical corticosteroid cream was applied. Within two months, his
eruption had cleared almost completely. The pathogenetic mechanisms of this case are unclear, but drug and UV light have been considered.
