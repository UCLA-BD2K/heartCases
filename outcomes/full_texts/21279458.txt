A 32-year-old female with a history of binge-purge type anorexia nervosa presented with abdominal pain and weight loss of 8 kg over the
preceding 2 weeks. She denied prior diuretic or laxative abuse. Physical examination showed a thin female with a BMI of 14.2 kg/m2. The
dorsal aspect of her hands revealed abrasions, callosities, and scarring (Fig. 1). Her hands were contracted in tetany, flexed at the
metacarpophalangeal joints, with extension at the interphalangeal joints with the thumb flexed and adducted (Fig. 2). Laboratory studies
revealed a serum calcium of 5.3 mg/dl, albumin of 3.0 g/dl, and normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone levels. Figure 1The

flexed at the metacarpophalangeal joints, with extension at the interphalangeal joints with the thumb flexed and adducted. The dorsal aspect
of the patient's hands revealed abrasions, callosities, and scarring. The patient's hands were contracted in tetany, flexed at the
metacarpophalangeal joints, with extension at the interphalangeal joints with the thumb flexed and adducted. Figure 1 demonstrates Russell’s
sign, with abrasions on the dorsum of the hand from contacting the incisors during self-induced vomiting1. This finding is reported in
approximately 4% of patients with purging type anorexia nervosa2. Figure 2 shows an obstetrician or accoucheur’s hand, demonstrating the
resemblance of tetany to the position one’s hand is held in while performing a vaginal delivery. Tetany of the patient's hands resolved with
electrolyte repletion. On endoscopic evaluation, her abdominal pain was found to be secondary to esophagitis, likely from self-induced
vomiting. Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits
