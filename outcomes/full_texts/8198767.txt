A patient complying with the clinical criteria for brain death was studied by preenhanced computed tomography (CT). Preenhanced CT showed
apparent increased density at the base of the brain along the course of the major arterial vessels, and abnormally dense-appearing deep
venous structures, like those of contrast-enhanced CT. There was a diffuse decrease in brain density with a poorly delineated ventricular
system. These CT findings were very characteristic. CT as a non-invasive method seems to be valuable in the diagnosis of brain death. The
relevant literature is reviewed and mechanisms showing those CT findings are discussed.
