Peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm and splenic infarction are rare but life-threatening complications of chronic pancreatitis. The incidence of
pseudoaneurysm in patients who undergo angiography for pancreatitis is about 10%. Clinically, pseudoaneurysm is hard to discover until
rupture occurs. The authors have recently experienced a case of intact pseudoaneurysm and splenic infarction in chronic alcoholic
pancreatitis. A bolus enhanced CT scan and angiography were essential to confirm these complications of pancreatitis. We managed these
complications successfully by distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy.
