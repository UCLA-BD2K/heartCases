obstruction in infants1. A spectrum of intrinsic obstructive lesions within the duodenum ranges from atresia to congenital bands2. Rarely,
duodenal malformations may first present in adulthood. Less than 70 cases of duodenal web presenting in an adult have been reported in the
literature. In 10 patients the presentation was associated with pancreatitis. We report a case of congenital duodenal web associated with
pancreas divisum which first presented in an adult with the clinical characteristics of recurrent acute pancreatitis.
