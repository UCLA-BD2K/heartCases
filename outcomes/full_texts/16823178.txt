Human papilloma virus (HPV) typing and Comparative Genomic Hybridisation (CGH) analysis can be used in the classification of multiple
tumours of the aerodigestive tract for the differentiation between secondary malignancy versus metastasis. We present 3 exemplary cases of
patients with multiple squamous cell carcinomas, localised within the head and neck region, cervical lymph node and the lung. In two
patients, HPV typing identified HPV type 16 in the tonsillar carcinomas and the corresponding cervical lymph node and lung carcinoma
indicating that the latter were metastatic spreads. In case 1, CGH confirmed the clonal relationship. Case two showed a peculiar syncytial
growth pattern with lymphocytic infiltration which may constitute a potential morphological marker for HPV infection. In case three, a
vallecular carcinoma was HPV negative while a lung cancer was positive for HPV type 6 indicating two independent primary tumours. Our case
triplet illustrates the variability of HPV infection in squamous cell cancer of the aerodigestive tract and power as well as limitations of
morphology, HPV typing and tumour genetics in the classification of multiple tumours.
