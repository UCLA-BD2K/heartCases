Two patients abruptly developed congestive heart failure and elevation in serum transaminase levels when given disopyramide phosphate;
enzyme abnormalities and hemodynamic status corrected upon withdrawal of the drug. Both patients had underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and viral hepatitis were ruled out in both patients. One patient had a liver biopsy documenting
central hepatic necrosis with congestion, consistent with hepatic ischemia and not toxic hepatitis. In the other patient, cardiac
decompensation and hepatocellular enzyme elevation were reproduced on rechallenge with the drug. Disopyramide should be used with caution in
patients with heart failure.
