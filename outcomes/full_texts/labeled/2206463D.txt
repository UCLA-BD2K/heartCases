Recurrent alternating stroke, i.e., one time ischemic and the other hemorrhagic or vice versa, is an uncommon event. We report a series of
eight patients who had recurrent alternating strokes, which were diagnosed by CT scans during the last four years. Infarcts preceded
hemorrhage in six patients. In the remaining two patients, hemorrhage developed first and infarct followed. All ischemic strokes were the
lacunar infarcts. The lesions of the two attacks were located in different sites in all cases except one. The mean age of the patients was
56.6 years at the time of the first attack and 57.5 years at the time of the second. The mean interval between attacks was 11.8 months. All
patients were hypertensive on admission. After the first attack, the outcome was favorable in all patients. However, after the second attack
the outcome deteriorated to moderate disability in three, severe disability in one and death in four. We discuss some possible reasons for
the rarity of recurrent alternating stroke.
