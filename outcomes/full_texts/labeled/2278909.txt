are associated with bile duct stricture, cholangitis and destruction of liver parenchyma. Suggested modes of treatment include surgical bile
duct exploration, endoscopic procedures, transhepatic cholangiolithotomy and liver resection. This paper reports 2 patients in whom liver
resection was performed because of intrahepatic ductal stones, bile duct strictures and repeated episodes of cholangitis. Liver resection
was uncomplicated and long-term results were satisfactory. Our results support the view that liver resection is indicated in rare instances
of intrahepatic bile duct stones associated with bile duct strictures.
