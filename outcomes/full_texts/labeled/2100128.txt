Fibrous hamartoma of infancy is an uncommon benign fibrous proliferation, usually presenting as a solitary nodule. A rare example of
multiple fibrous hamartoma of infancy is described. Two masses which developed in the upper arm of a 10-month-old boy were successfully
excised, and one month later three small nodules 2 cm below the previous operation field appeared. It will be further elucidated whether
multiple forms and early recurrence are related or not as cases accumulate.
