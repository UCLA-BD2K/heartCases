Immunopathological evidence suggests that activation of the alternative pathway of complement (AP) is involved in membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and in immunoglobulin A nephropathy. In this report we describe an AP dysfunction-associated factor that was
isolated from the serum and urine of a patient with hypocomplementemic MPGN. Extensive glomerular deposits of C3, properdin, and of the
terminal complement components were observed in the kidney of the patient. In her serum the AP hemolytic activity was virtually absent. When
mixed with fresh normal serum, the patient's serum induced a 96% C3 conversion during a 30-min incubation at +37 degrees C. This activity
was found to be due to a circulating factor that by immunochemical characterization proved to be a 46-kD monoclonal immunoglobulin lambda
light (L) chain dimer (lambda L). Purified lambda L, but not control lambda or kappa L chains from patients with L chain disease, activated
the AP in a dose- and ionic strength-dependent manner. Functionally, lambda L was differentiated from C3 nephritic factor (an autoantibody
against the AP C3 convertase, C3bBb) by its inability to bind to and stabilize the C3bBb enzyme. Instead, lambda L was observed to interact
directly with the AP control factor H. Thus, lambda L represents a novel type of immunoglobulin-related AP- activating factor with the
capacity to initiate alternative complement pathway activation in the fluid phase.
