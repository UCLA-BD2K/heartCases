We experienced a case of chronic fibrosing pancreatitis in an 18/12-year-old girl, which was idiopathic because there were no familial back
ground, no cystic fibrosis of pancrease, no ductal anomalies and obstruction. The patient presented intermittent colicky abdominal pain and
progressive obstructive jaundice, but T-tube drainage and removal of the lymph nodes around the common bile duct relieved her symptoms and
disease process. This seems to be the first case reported in a Korean child. Idiopathic fibrosing pancreatitis should be considered in the
differential diagnosis of abdominal pain with obstructive jaundice in children.
