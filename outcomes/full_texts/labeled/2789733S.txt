We studied three patients with spontaneous mesencephalic hemorrhages. All presented with some degree of impaired consciousness and abnormal
ocular movements. One patient had a convergence-retraction nystagmus with a unilateral hemorrhage confined to the dorsal midbrain. Another
patient showed left third nerve palsy due to a unilateral hemorrhage that involved ventral midbrain. The third patient revealed left
internuclear ophthalmoplegia with ataxia due to a pinpoint hemorrhage in the tegmentum of the left midbrain. The patients survived and major
neurologic deficits recovered, but abnormal ocular movements persisted.
