An increasing number of families in the United States are converting to woodburning stoves in an effort to reduce winter heating bills.
Woodburning stoves operate as a contained combuster of wood and produce a variety of pollutants as byproducts of combustion. Although
technological advances have reduced emissions to some degree, even the most efficient woodburning stoves emit hazardous pollutants directly
into the home when the stove is operating and the door is opened to add wood. The question arises as to whether pollutants are accumulating
in homes where woodburning stoves are used as a source of heat. This issue is especially important considering the trend to increase home
insulation and overall airtightness in an effort to conserve energy and reduce heat loss. This paper reviews the clinical case report that
first postulated an association of recurrent chest illness with woodburning stove exposure and summarizes the findings to date on
respiratory effects of wood heat for young children.
