obstructive jaundice due to intraductal growth, diagnosed intraoperatively by cholangiography and histological examination, and radically
treated by left lobectomy, extrahepatic biliary tract resection and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. Survival after operation was 13 months.
Other similar cases reported in the literature are reviewed.
