Surgical decompression of osteomyelitis in pediatric patients should be an essential part of therapy in most cases. The initial deferral of
prompt decompression in two patients because of underlying chronic, hemorrhagic (thrombocytopenic) disorders—one with Wiskott-Aldrich
syndrome and one with Gaucher's disease—resulted in more serious and prolonged courses of the infectious processes. The complications might
have been ameliorated by earlier drainage in each case. Based upon the experience gained from these two patients, we recommend early
drainage, with appropriate treatment of the hemorrhagic disorder, to prevent more widespread dissemination or prolongation of osseous
infection in similarly affected children.
