Lateral cervical meningocele is an extremely rare developmental anomaly. We could find only one such case protruding from an enlarged C2-3
intervertebral foramen. It may be confused with an extradural cyst or cystic hygroma. Direct needling may introduce infection and thereby
pyogenic meningitis and so should be avoided. Similarly, incision and drainage may transform it into cerebrospinal fluid fistula. A computed
tomography scan is the most fruitful form of investigation for confirmation and localization of the disease. A lumboperitoneal shunt or
water tight closure of the dural sac at the neck is the recommended procedure of choice.
