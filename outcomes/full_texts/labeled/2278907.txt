are reported. In one of the patients, symptoms were secondary to obstruction of inferior vena cava and hepatic outflow tract. The other
patient was operated on with a diagnosis of extrahepatic presinusoidal portal hypertension caused by extrinsic compression of the liver by
an hydatid cyst. Although hydatidosis is a benign disease, it can produce serious complications as in these reported cases. Therefore
hydatidosis should be remembered amongst the causes of portal hypertension in countries where the disease is endemic.
