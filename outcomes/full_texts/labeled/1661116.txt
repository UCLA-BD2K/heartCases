A case of metastatic adrenal cortical carcinoma in which partial remission was achieved with transarterial embolization is presented as
probably the first reported case in the literature to date. A 29-year-old woman was admitted because of adrenal cortical carcinoma which had
not responded to mitotane. A left adrenalectomy with segmentectomy of the involved liver had been done previously. Abdominal computerized
tomography demonstrated multiple large metastatic tumors in the liver. Transarterial embolization with Gelfoam and 20 mCi of 131I-labeled
lipiodol was performed and resulted in a decrease in tumor size and biochemical parameters. Transarterial embolization can be one of the
therapeutic modalities for metastatic adrenal cortical carcinomas.
