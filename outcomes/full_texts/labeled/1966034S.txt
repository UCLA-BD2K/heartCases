Current asthma is often diagnostically excluded by the presence of normal bronchial responsiveness. We report on a TDI-induced occupational
asthma patient with normal bronchial responsiveness. He had suffered from shortness of breath during and after TDI exposure for several
months. His initial methacholine bronchial challenge test showed a negative response. The bronchoprovacation test with TDI showed an
isolated immediate bronchoconstriction. The following methacholine bronchial challenge tests revealed that the bronchial hyperresponsiveness
developed seven hours after the TDI challenge (methacholine PC20:5.1 mg/ml), progressed up until 24 hours, and returned to normal on the
seventh day. This case provides evidence that the response of the airway to TDI may not always be accompanied by bronchial
hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. Screening programs utilizing methacholine challenges may not always identify TDI-sensitized asthmatic
workers.
