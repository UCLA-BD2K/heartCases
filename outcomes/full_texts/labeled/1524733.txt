Pancreatoblastoma has been described in children and characterized by unique histologic features and excellent clinical course.
Ultrastructural and immunohistochemical studies of pancreatoblastoma reveal either exocrine alone or both endocrine and exocrine
differentiation. We present two cases of pancreatoblastoma in children in which immunohistochemical and ultrastructural examination failed
to demonstrate features of either enzyme or hormone production and which became worse in clinical course. We assume that pancreatoblastomas
are tumors which differentiate more toward acinar or ductal elements than toward islet cell.
