A patient with metastatic melanoma developed symmetric miliary infiltrates of the lungs while receiving injections of MER into tumor
containing lymph nodes of the groin. Open lung biopsy identified the pulmonary lesions as caseating epithelioid granulomas. After cessation
of MER therapy, the pulmonary lesions regressed spontaneously. The possible etiology of this so-far-unreported complication of MER therapy
was briefly discussed.
