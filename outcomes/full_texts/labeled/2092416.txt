Recurrent meningitis in the absence of an identifiable causative organism or anatomical source is a difficult diagnostic challenge for any
infectious disease consultant. We evaluated a 49-year-old woman with episodes of meningitis which occurred on at least nine separate
occasions for over 24 years. No causative organism, physical agent, or underlying disease process was identified as the source of this
patient's recurrent lymphocytic meningitis. When computerized tomographic head scanning was first performed in 1977, a prominence of the
left lateral ventricle was evident. It was not until the area was subsequently evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging techniques 13 years
later that a lesion could be clearly identified, removed, and evaluated at pathology. Time alone will tell whether the lesion, a cavernous
hemangioma, was truly the cause of this patient's recurrent aseptic meningitis for 24 years.
