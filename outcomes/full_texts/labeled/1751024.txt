An extraordinary eye movement was seen in a vegetative patient. His eyeballs were exotropic in the primary position and showed dissociated
nystagmus which appeared alternately in each eye every few seconds. He also had palatal myoclonus quite asynchronous with the nystagmus. To
our knowledge, there has been no such nystagmus documented in the literature. We report the new nystagmus with his EOG and brain MRI.
