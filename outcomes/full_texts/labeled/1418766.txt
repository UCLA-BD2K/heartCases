We report on a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus, who, during the course of the illness, developed thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura. In this case, the coexistence of these two conditions was confirmed by laboratory and pathologic findings. The infusion of fresh
frozen plasma with plasmapheresis reversed the course of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
