Eighty-four women at high risk for ovarian cancer by having first-degree relatives with epithelial ovarian cancer participated in a newly
established, early ovarian cancer detection program at Yale University. Participants were to be evaluated with physical examinations and
circulating tumor markers at entry and every six months thereafter. Endovaginal ultrasound and color Doppler flow studies were to be
performed at three and nine months following entry into the program. In addition, women were encouraged to follow American Cancer Society
guidelines for mammography. Stool was checked for occult blood. Endometrial sampling was offered to post-menopausal women. No participant
has developed an ovarian cancer since entering the program. One woman has been diagnosed to have breast cancer. False-positive levels of
circulating tumor markers (CA 125, 4/84 [4.8 percent]; lipid-associated sialic acid in plasma, 13/84 [15.5 percent]; NB/70K, 4/84 [4.8
percent]; and urinary gonadotropin fragment, 1/65 [1.5 percent]) were observed on entry into the program. Low resistive indices (less than
0.5) were documented in 8/91 (8.8 percent) ovaries studied by the color Doppler flow technique. One participant underwent a laparotomy based
on a false-positive endovaginal ultrasound examination. Tests now being employed in community practice have a high likelihood of being
associated with false-positive results. Therapeutic interventions based on isolated abnormal tumor markers or ultrasound studies obtained
from women with family histories of ovarian cancer may lead to inappropriate surgery. It is necessary for cancer centers to develop
expertise in ovarian cancer detection techniques to advise physicians in their geographic areas appropriately about the significance of the
abnormal screening test.
