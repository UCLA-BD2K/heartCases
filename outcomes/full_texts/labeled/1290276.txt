Recognition of clinical syndromes in returned travelers is an important part of providing care to international travelers. The first step is
to take a history with attention to pre-travel preventive measures, the patient's itinerary, and potential exposure to infectious agents.
The patient should then be examined to document physical signs, such as fever, rash, or hepatosplenomegaly, and to have basic laboratory
data obtained. This evaluation will provide most physicians with the necessary information to generate a differential diagnosis. Each
diagnosis should be matched against the incubation period of the disease, the geographic location of illness, the frequency of illness in
returned travelers, and the pre-travel preventive measures. Careful attention to these aspects of patient care should result in the
appropriate diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for the ill returned traveler.
