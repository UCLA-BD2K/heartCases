endoscopy to have varicosities at the site of a duodeno-jejunostomy which had been performed for duodenal atresia when he was three days
old. Angiography revealed an occluded portal vein with an extensive collateral circulation. At laparotomy some of the collateral vessels
were found to pass through the anastomotic site and directly into the left lobe of the liver. The portal pressure was found to be minimally
elevated. Resection of the anastomotic segment was performed with reconstruction using a Roux en Y jejunal loop. Bleeding from collateral
vessels passing through an anastomosis site in a patient with extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis has not previously been reported.
