developed recurrent acute pancreatitis leading to calcific chronic pancreatitis. She had previously been treated with two cyst drainage

Severe continuing symptoms led to pylorus-preserving proximal pancreatoduodenectomy, which was undertaken to prevent future carcinoma in the
cyst remnant and progression of the chronic pancreatitis
