ductal carcinoma in the body and tail of the pancreas. Four months later a metastasis was removed from the abdominal scar, and 14 months
later another metastasis was removed from the anterior wall of the stomach. Moreover, he had a left mastectomy followed by radiation therapy
for a primary ductal carcinoma and a transurethral resection of the prostate because of benign hyperplasia. A minor focus of primary highly
differentiated adenocarcinoma was found in the chips. More than 6 years later, the patient is without any signs of recurrences.
