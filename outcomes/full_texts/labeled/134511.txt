This study was supported in part by Grants HL-08659 and HD-07276 and a contract (NO1 HU-52933) from the National Institutes of Health. The
growth of complex diagnostic and therapeutic technologies in the clinical management of cardiovascular diseases has mandated a more
comprehensive and detailed analysis of cases which reach the pathology laboratory. This report describes in detail the relatively simple
techniques and protocol which we have employed for postmortem evaluation of the coronary vascular bed and myocardium. The key elements
include the use of a pigmented gelatin mass containing radiopaque material (Barosperse), proper injection technique with simultaneous
filling of the main coronary vessels at identical pressures, postmortem arteriography, cardiac dissection, and histologic confirmation of
coronary and myocardial lesions. Three cases with sharply differing cardiac diseases are presented to illustrate the kind of information
which may be obtained with this approach. Our experience in terms of frequency and distribution of occlusive coronary vascular disease and
the relationship to age and sex has been summarized. Significant disease (> 75% lumenal obstruction) was identified angiographically and
confirmed by dissection in 46 of 57 cases of clinically suspected disease. None of six hearts from patients without clinical evidence for
cardiovascular disease demonstrated actual or angiographically false-positive occlusive coronary disease. It is suggested that a more
detailed analysis of the coronary vascular bed can be accomplished in the pathology laboratory with this relatively simple approach and that
important information bearing on clinical management can be reliably obtained.
