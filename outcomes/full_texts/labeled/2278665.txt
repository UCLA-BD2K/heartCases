Subependymoma is a rare, slow-growing, benign noninvasive tumor of the central nervous system that may be located in the fourth ventricle,
the septum pellucidum, the third and the lateral ventricles, the aqueduct, and the proximal spinal cord. Symptoms, if any, usually result
either from direct compression of the brain stem or from acute hydrocephalus due to occlusion of the foramen of Monro or aqueduct of
Sylvius. In this report, we describe a case of subependymoma of the lateral ventricle with headache in a young female patient. This is the
first reported case subependymoma in Korea that was documented along with Magnetic resonance image.
