The arsenic content of well water in certain areas of Oregon can range up to 30 to 40 times the U.S.P.H.S. Drinking Water Standard of 1962,
where concentrations in excess of 50 ppb are grounds for rejection. The elevated arsenic levels in water are postulated to be due to
volcanic deposits. Wells in central Lane County, Oregon, that are known to contain arsenic rich water are in an area underlain by a
particular group of sedimentary and volcanic rocks, which geologists have named the Fischer formation. The arsenic levels in water from
wells ranged from no detectable amounts to 2,000 ppb. In general the deeper wells contained higher arsenic water. The high arsenic waters
are characterized by the small amounts of calcium and magnesium in relation to that of sodium, a high content of boron, and a high pH. Water
from some hot springs in other areas of Oregon was found to range as high as 900 ppb arsenic. Arsenic blood levels ranged from 32 ppb for
people living in areas where water is low in arsenic to 250 ppb for those living in areas where water is known to contain high levels of
arsenic. Some health problems associated with consumption of arsenic-rich water are discussed.
