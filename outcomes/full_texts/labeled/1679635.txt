Ten cases of post-inflammatory aneurysm of the thoracic aorta were studied morphologically using aortic wall and aortic valve tissue
resected during the surgical repair of the lesions. Four cases of aortic aneurysm in Behcet's disease showed massive perivascular
infiltration of the lymphocytes and plasma cells in adventitia and vasa vasorum. Fibrous obliteration of the vasa vasorum was seen, and
neutrophilic infiltration was also associated in two cases with recurrent prosthetic valve failure. Three cases of aortic aneurysm
associated with Takayasu's arteritis showed similar histologic features, but giant cells and histiocytic reactions were additional findings.
Plasma cell infiltration was more pronounced compared to the Behcet's aortitis. One case of luetic aortitis showed a non-specific chronic
inflammatory reaction with florid endothelial cell proliferation. One case of ankylosing spondylitis showed fibrous thickening at the
periannular portion of the aortic valve cusps, but this finding was also seen in an aortic valve of a patient with Behcet's disease. One
case without any disease association showed similar features of chronic inflammation with granuloma formation. The findings suggest that
they have similar histologic features indistinguishable in terms of the clinical disease association, but a granulomatous reaction could be
expected in Takayasu's arteritis.
