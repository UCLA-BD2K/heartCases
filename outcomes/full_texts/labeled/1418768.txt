An unusual localization of localized colitis cystica profunda in a 31-year-old man is described. The patient presented as anal bleeding and
a protruding mass at the descending colon; the mass was polypoid and was made up of papillary epithelial hyperplasia with downward
herniation of glands into the submucosa. Only one similar case involving a descending colon has been reported in the world literature.
