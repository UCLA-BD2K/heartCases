portal hypertension. This report describes a patient with such a disorder, presenting with bleeding esophageal varices and ascites. It
emphasises the importance of performing selective catheterization of the celiac and superior mesenteric artery in all patients with signs of
portal hypertension without evidence of chronic liver disease. Etiopathology and management are discussed.
