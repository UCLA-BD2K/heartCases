The allotype of the sixth component of complement was determined in a patient before and after liver transplantation. The C6 phenotype
changed from A before transplantation to B (the donor phenotype) within 10 days of the transplant and remained wholly of the donor phenotype
at 17 wk. This demonstrates that the liver is the exclusive or predominant site of C6 synthesis in vivo in man.
