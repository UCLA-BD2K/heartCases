described. Both patients presented with a clinical picture of obstructive jaundice one to two years following radiotherapy for a malignant
condition. As no recurrent tumour was detected in either of the patients the strictures were considered to be the result of radiation
therapy. Bilio-enteric decompression was performed in both patients who are well at follow up one and ten years after the procedure.
