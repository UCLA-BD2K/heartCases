Two cases of gestational choriocarcinoma have been examined for the expression of HLA and trophoblast antigens using the indirect
immunoperoxidase technique on frozen tissue sections. Approximately 40-70% of tumour cells express MHC Class I antigen as detected by a
panel of antibodies to monomorphic, or framework, MHC Class I antigenic determinants. Evidence in one case suggests that most of these cells
may not express the paternal, polymorphic HLA antigenic determinants but that a small subpopulation do carry the fully antigenically active
molecule. These latter may give rise to patient anti-paternal HLA antibodies. Class II (HLA DR or DC) antigens are expressed by none, or
very few, tumour cells.
