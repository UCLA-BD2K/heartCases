diagnosis was made at a relatively early stage and treatment was successful for one patient, but an accurate diagnosis of liver abscess was
not made and invasive extraintestinal amebiasis led to multiple organ failure and to death for the other. Neither patient had been outside
of Japan, and both were heterosexual. The origins of Entamoeba histolytica infection could not be determined. Though the mortality rate is
high in cases of ruptured amebic liver abscess, appropriate management can lead to a good prognosis.
