A case of nerve sheath myxoma also called as neurothekeoma in a 33-year-old woman is described. The lesion appeared as a painful, elevated
nodule on the scalp for several months, without an appreciable increase in size. Microscopically, it showed typical histologic
characteristics of nerve sheath myxoma, and tumor cells revealed strong, positive reaction for S-100 protein and negativity for epithelial
membrane antigen (EMA) on immunohistochemical staining. These immunohistochemical findings of this case support the view that the origin
cells of this tumor may be schwann cells rather than perineurial cells. The histogenesis and differential diagnosis of this tumor are
discussed.
