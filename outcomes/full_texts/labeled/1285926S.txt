'Pauci-immune' glomerulonephritis has been recognized as an important cause of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. The paucity of immune
deposits can be separated from the other two major immunohistologic variants of crescentic glomerulonephritis, ie, antiglomerular basement
membrane (GBM) antibody-mediated and immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis. Here we describe the case of a 42-year-old woman with
pauci-immune' glomerulonephritis and vasculitis presenting as rapidly progressive renal failure with characteristic pathologic and
immunohistologic findings. And in this case, despite oliguria and rapid deterioration of renal function, the renal function recovered
partially and continued to be stabilized with a favourable response to hemodialysis and combined system immunosuppressive therapy.
