condition. We present the case of a patient who was operated on with a preoperative diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver resection
was performed and antituberculous therapy was started. It is difficult to make the correct diagnosis preoperatively except when a successful
needle biopsy can be performed. Despite the rarity of the condition primary solitary tuberculosis should be considered among the space
occupying lesions of the liver.
