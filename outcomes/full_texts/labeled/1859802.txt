Preoperative diagnostic techniques, including echography, CT and angiography, did not provide sufficient criteria for a precise diagnosis.
The mass was removed with an extended right hepatectomy with no particular physiopathological consequences. Histological analysis revealed
that this was a metastasis from a melonoma of the choroid, operated on 17 years previously.
