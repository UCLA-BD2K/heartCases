A case of aneurysmal ("angiomatoid") fibrous histiocytoma (AFH) in a 12-year-old girl is presented with its unusual clinicopathologic
features. The lesion had the full microscopic characteristics of AFH described in prior reports, but it also had some features that differed
from the original description of the disorder, such as the involvement of subcutis, its occurrence in the scalp, and a documented history of
minor trauma. The lesion clinically resembled the gross features of hemangioma. The experience in the present case raises the need for
considering AFH as one of major differential diagnosis of nodular cutaneous tumors in children that simulate malignancy such as angiomatoid
malignant fibrous histiocytoma and Kaposi's sarcoma.
