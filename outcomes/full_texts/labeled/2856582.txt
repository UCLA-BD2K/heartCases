A 45-year-old woman with epidermolysis bullosa aquisita is presented. The clinical, histological, and immunopathological features were in
keeping with the previous reports of this disease. The patient also had anti-basal cell cytoplasmic antibodies at a significant titer, which
is considered an unusual finding associated with this disorder. Treatment with a moderate dose of corticosteroid was effective in
controlling the bullous lesions.
