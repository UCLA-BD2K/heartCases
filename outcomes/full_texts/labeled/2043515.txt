liver lobe atrophy and hypertrophy occasionally complicates the surgical approach for biliary stricture repair. Benign biliary stricture
following hepatic resection deserves special consideration in this regard because the inevitable hypertrophy of the residual liver causes
marked rotation and displacement of the hepatic hilum that if not anticipated may render exposure for repair difficult and dangerous. Three
patients with biliary stricture after hepatectomy illustrate the influence of hepatic regeneration on attempts at subsequent stricture
repair. Following left hepatectomy, hypertrophy of the right and caudate lobes causes an anteromedial rotation and displacement of the
portal structures. After right hepatectomy, the rotation is posterolateral, and a thoracoabdominal approach may be necessary for adequate
exposure. Radiographs obtained in the standard anteroposterior projection may be deceptive, and lateral views are recommended to aid in
operative planning.
