Fanconi syndrome is a complex of renal tubular dysfunctions defined by glycosuria without diabetes, aminoaciduria, phosphaturia, and renal
tubular acidosis. It is often associated with hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and rickets or osteomalacia. Although it is usually found in
the setting of other well-established non-renal diseases, Fanconi syndrome may present without identifiable etiology or association. Very
infrequently a patient with idiopathic Fanconi syndrome will progress to chronic renal failure. This case report details the course of such
a patient over the 20 years since his diagnosis and discusses the syndrome's genetic background, clinical features, putative
pathophysiology, and therapeutic options, including transplantation.
