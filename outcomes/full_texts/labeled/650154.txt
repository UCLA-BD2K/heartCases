Peripheral blood leukocytes of three patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) contained very low or undetectable levels of elastase, the
major neutral protease in these cells. Likewise, peritoneal exudate leukocytes of beige mice (the murine counterpart of CHS) contained
correspondingly reduced levels of their major neutral protease, a serine enzyme of mol wt 27,000. The elastase deficiency in CHS
polymorphonuclear leukocytes might account in part for the high incidence of infections in these patients.
