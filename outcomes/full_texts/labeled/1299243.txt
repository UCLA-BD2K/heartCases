The authors describe a male newborn with multiple congenital anomalies; craniofacial dysmorphism, bilateral cleft palate and lip, ambiguous
external genitalia with absence of phallus, ventricular septal defect, agenesis of olfactory bulbs, and presence of small round cells
simulating migration defect in the cerebellar white matter. Cytogenetic study demonstrated a chromosomal constitution of 47,XY, +21, +5q.
Its pathological significance compared with Down's syndrome and hitherto reported partial trisomy 5q is discussed.
