Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common hereditary enzyme disorder and more than 200 million people have a
deficiency in this enzyme. It is a globally important cause of neonatal jaundice and causes life-threatening hemolytic crisis in childhood.
At later ages, certain drugs such as antimalarials, and fava beans cause hemolysis among G6PD deficiency patients. The frequency and
severity is influenced by genetic and cultural factors. It is common in Mediterranean, African, and some East Asian populations but rare in
Korea. Four cases of G6PD deficiency which were first noticed in Korea are investigated with their clinical features.
