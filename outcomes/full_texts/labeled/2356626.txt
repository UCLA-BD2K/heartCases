Skin or subcutaneous infection with aspergillus is uncommon. It has been described in disseminated aspergillosis, as localized infection in
the immunocompromised host and as a complication of trauma and burns. Described in this paper is a diabetic patient who developed a fatal
Aspergillus infection following debridement of a necrotizing fasciitis. "Fruiting bodies," rarely found in vivo, were seen on pathologic
examination of subcutaneous tissue. Her course was similar to that of burn patients with invasive fungal disease, where mortality is high
and radical debridement is the only chance for cure.
