A congenital neoplasm arising in the central nervous system is rarely encountered, and the majority of case reports that have dealt with
intracranial tumors have been divided almost equally between teratomas and various gliomas. We experienced a rare case of congenital
glioblastoma multiforme encountered in a three day-old male infant who presented with hydrocephalus since birth. Post-mortem examination
revealed that the tumor seemed to have originated from the right thalamic region extending centrifugally to the cerebral cortex and through
the brain-stem down to the cerebellum.
