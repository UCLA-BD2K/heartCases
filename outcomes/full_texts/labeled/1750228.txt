The known effects of calcium channel blockers on various aspects of potassium homeostasis are reviewed. Regulation of potassium homeostasis
requires both renal and external handling mechanisms. Signaling by calcium appears to mediate both of these. Calcium channels have been
identified in adrenal glomerulosa cells, and cellular calcium entry has been demonstrated in vitro to be necessary for the synthesis and
secretion of aldosterone. Calcium channel antagonists such as verapamil and nifedipine, at pharmacologic doses, can block aldosterone
production. In vivo, however, only chronic administration of verapamil appears to attenuate aldosterone responsiveness to angiotensin II.
Chronic administration of nifedipine does not have a dramatic effect on aldosterone production following potassium loading. Other studies
have demonstrated improved extrarenal potassium disposal following treatment with calcium channel blocking agents. Clinically, there are no
reports of either hyperkalemia or hypokalemia with the routine therapeutic use of these agents given alone. This review was prompted by the
development of hyperkalemia in a patient with chronic renal failure following the initiation of therapy with the calcium channel blocker
diltiazem: however, numerous other etiologies may also have contributed to the development of hyperkalemia in this case. Review of the data
indicates that current evidence implicating this class of drugs in the pathogenesis of disordered potassium regulation remains equivocal.
