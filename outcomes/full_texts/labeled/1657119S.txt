jaundice. Computed tomography showed a large mass in the right hepatic lobe and marked dilatation of the biliary tree in the left lateral
segment of the liver. Angiography showed evidence of neovascularity. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography revealed complete obstruction
of the common bile duct just below the bifurcation. The serum level of alpha-fetoprotein on admission was 1,080,000 ng/ml. These findings
suggested to us a primary hepatocellular carcinoma invading the intrahepatic bile duct. Extended right lobectomy and hepaticojejunostomy for
bile drainage was carried out. The patient is doing well 3 years after surgery. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) invading to the portal vein
is not so rare, but invasion into the bile duct is much less common. In 1947, Mallory1 described a single case of HCC invading the
gallbladder and obstructing extrahepatic bile ducts. In 1975, Lin2 termed this HCC “Icteric type hepatoma”. The incidence of such HCC in
Japan was reported to be 1.9-9%2,3. Obstructive jaundice is a clinical manifestation of the terminal stage in HCC. We describe here our
treatment of a woman with HCC invading the common bile duct. Right extended lobectomy and reconstruction of hepaticojejunostomy were
effective.
