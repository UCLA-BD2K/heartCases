Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) is a highly malignant childhood tumor, distinguished from classic Wilms' tumor by its propensity to
metastasize to the skeletal system. Authors described a case of CCSK from a 3-year-old boy in the right kidney, showing various histologic
features, such as classic, epithelioid, trabecular, neurilemmoma-like, cystic and entrapped collecting tubular pattern. Ultrastructurally
epithelial differentiation was absent. Immunohistochemically, none of the intrinsic tumor cells showed positive staining with the antibodies
against the keratin, S-100 protein, carcinoembryonic antigen, vimentin, desmin and myoglobin, suggesting primitive mesenchymal cell in
origin.
