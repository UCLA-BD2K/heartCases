A case of inflammatory pseudotumor of the lung occurring in a six-year-old boy is reported with clinicopathologic findings, including its
ultrastructure. The patient had had frequent upper respiratory tract infections, and one and half year before the discovery of the lung
mass, he suffered from pneumonia of the right lung, which was serologically proven to be a mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Exploratory
thoracotomy revealed a large mediastinal mass that was removed together with the right middle and lower lobes of the lung. The mass arose
from the lung with an endobronchial element. Microscopically, the mass was composed of a variety of inflammatory and mesenchymal cells,
including plasma cells, histiocytes, lymphocytes, and fibroblast-like spindle cells. Ultrastructurally, the spindle-shaped mesenchymal cells
were either fibroblasts or myofibroblasts. At the time of diagnosis of the inflammatory pseudotumor of the lung, the serum titer of
antimycoplasma antibody rose again, and the lung parenchyma adjacent to the mass showed interstitial pneumonia with features of
bronchiolitis obliterans. The present case suggests that the inflammatory pseudotumor of the lung could be a postinflammatory lesion
associated with mycoplasma pneumoniae infection.
