A rare case of spinal epidural granulocytic sarcoma (GS) preceding acute myelogenous leukemia is described. A 10-year-old boy presented with
lower leg weakness. The initial diagnosis was a histiocytic lymphoma, and he was treated accordingly. No evidence of bone marrow involvement
was found at that time. The correct diagnosis of epidural GS was made possible in retrospect by using immunoperoxidase staining for lysozyme
fourteen months later when the patient showed the full-blown features of leukemia. This rare tumor should be considered in the differential
diagnosis of an epidural mass with cord compression in patients with or even without acute leukemia, because early diagnosis followed by
appropriate combined chemotherapy and radiation may obviate surgical intervention and eventually prevent leukemic transformation.
