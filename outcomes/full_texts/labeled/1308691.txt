A 29-year-old man admitted to a psychiatric unit was successfully treated for a paranoid psychosis with trifluoperazine. Following reduction
of neuroleptic dosage and addition of paroxetine he developed severe extra-pyramidal side effects. These remitted after withdrawal of
medication and did not recur following recommencement of trifluoperazine. This is the first report of such a side effect associated with
paroxetine use in man.
