Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis has been observed almost exclusively in women, usually in their reproductive years. Exacerbations with
pregnancy and after hormonal manipulation have been documented, and it has been suggested that its pathogenesis is due to the influence of
hormonal(estrogenic) stimulus. The clinical, roentgenographic, and histopathologic features of this case of pulmonary
lymphangioleiomyomatosis in a 22-year-old male are all characteristic of those described in prior reports, except for the patient's sex.
With the following case of pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis in a male, we suggest the possibility of the existence of an additional
pathogenetic mechanism.
