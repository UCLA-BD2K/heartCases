pancreatic injuries has resulted from parallel growth in the volume of motor vehicle accidents and societal violence. However, few surgeons
are aware that complications may be considerably delayed following pancreatic trauma, occurring in some cases months to years after apparent
recovery from the original injury. In four patients with blunt pancreatic trauma initially treated by non-operative means, stricture of the
main pancreatic duct developed over a period of months as a result of progressive fibrosis at the site of ductal injury. Pancreatic duct
hypertension was demonstrated to be present in the obstructed duct, and secondary changes of chronic pancreatitis developed in the
obstructed segment of the gland (“upstream” chronic pancreatitis). Seven similar patients with delayed onset of chronic obstructive
pancreatitis after pancreatic trauma were found in the literature. Symptoms related to these acquired ductal strictures are most commonly
those of abdominal pain and recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. Recognition of post-traumatic chronic obstructive pancreatitis
principally involves awareness that injuries to the pancreatic duct can produce remote complications. Pancreatoenteric drainage, or
resection of the obstructed segment of pancreas, provides prompt and effective relief.
