blunt liver trauma despite the use of intracaval shunting. Prolonged liver arterial inflow control, total hepatic venous isolation and
lobectomy without shunting was used in a patient to repair a combined vena caval and hepatic venous injury after blunt liver injury. An
extended period of normothermic hepatic ischemia was tolerated. Early recognition of retrohepatic venous injury and temporary liver packing
to control bleeding and correct hypovolemia are essential before caval occlusion. Hepatic vascular isolation without shunting is an
effective simple alternative technique allowing major venous repair in complex liver trauma.
