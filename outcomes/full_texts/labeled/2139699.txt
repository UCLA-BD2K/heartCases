We have characterized a child with a severe combined immunodeficiency disease syndrome with increased numbers, but a normal distribution, of
CD3+ T cells. This patient's immunological defect appears to be attributable to a selective deficiency in T cell production of IL-2, which
may reflect a subtle abnormality in the IL-2 gene locus or a defect in a regulatory factor necessary for IL-2 transcription. The increased
numbers of phenotypically normal T cells in this patient suggest that alternative pathways of T cell development exist in man or that IL-2
production intra- and extrathymically is controlled via distinct regulatory mechanisms.
