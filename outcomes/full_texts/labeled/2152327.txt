required emergency Cesarean section for fetal distress. This condition has not been reported in association with pregnancy. Only forty cases
of spontaneous bile duct perforation in adults have been previously reported. Seventy percent of these perforations were related to biliary
calculi. Sites of perforation were evenly distributed between common hepatic duct and common bile duct. Recommended treatment includes
cholecystectomy, common bile duct exploration, T-tube placement, and Roux-En-Y ductal anastomosis if disruption is extensive.
