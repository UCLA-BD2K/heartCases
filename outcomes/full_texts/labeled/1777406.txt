in the setting of chronic allograft rejection, 8 years after liver transplantation using the gallbladder-conduit, is presented. Extrahepatic
biliary obstruction may be seen in the late follow-up of liver grafting and rejection phenomena may play a significant role in the
development of such obstruction.
