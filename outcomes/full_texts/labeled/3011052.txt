Four Ugandan patients (1 women, 3 men) with generalized Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) were seen in the Uganda Cancer Institute between October 1983
and December 1984. They presented with generalized lymphadenopathy, plaques/nodules on the body, general swelling of the head, oral and
visceral involvement and respiratory distress. Initial responses to adriamycin as a single or a combination chemotherapy of actinomycin D,
vincristine, adriamycin and imidazole carboxamide appeared to be favourable but no sustained response was obtained. Serological tests for
human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-II) antibodies were positive in all 4 cases.
