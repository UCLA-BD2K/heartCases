Karyotyping and marker analysis of G- and C-banded metaphases from a metastatic bronchial carcinoma revealed a dominant stemline with five
markers and four sidelines with additional markers. One to three minute bodies were noted in the majority of cells and these were classified
as markers. On the basis of this analysis it was possible to postulate an evolutionary pathway within the tumour whereby the stemline was
derived from existing sidelines.
