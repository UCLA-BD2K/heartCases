A 51-year-old female was diagnosed preoperatively to have a pheochromocytoma producing ACTH. This diagnosis was based upon her paroxysmal
hypertension, hyperpigmentation, and hypokalemia. Elevated levels of serum and urine corticosteroids, plasma ACTH, urinary VMA, and
catecholamines fell after a right adrenal pheochromocytoma was removed. Subsequently this tumor was found to have a high content of ACTH.
Review of the literature indicates a mortality rate of 57% for this syndrome. Proper preoperative recognition and management can result in
total cure.
