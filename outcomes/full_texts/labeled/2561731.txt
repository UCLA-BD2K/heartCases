Sclerosing hemangiomas of the lung are benign neoplasms of uncertain histogenesis. We analysed two cases of sclerosing hemangiomas of the
lung with histochemistry and electron microscopy. They had a variegated histologic appearance characterized by an admixture of solid,
hemorrhagic, papillary and sclerotic lesions. Characteristic uniform round cells, unique to this tumor, were found within the stroma in all
lesions. In the electron microscopic examination, we found Weibel-Palade bodies like small bodies in the tumor cells. We suspect hypothesis
originating in the endothelial cell can not be completely excluded yet. Sclerosing hemangioma is a distinct clinicopathologic entity and
should be distinguished from other benign neoplasms or inflammatory lesions of the lung.
