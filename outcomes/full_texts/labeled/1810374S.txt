three years, presented with pyrexia, jaundice and upper abdominal pain. On ultrasound examination the biliary tree was dilated, contained
sludge and a cystic lesion was present in the liver. An endoscopic cholangiogram showed multiple filling defects in the bile duct which were
not felt to be removable endoscopically and a nasobiliary drain was therefore inserted. On resolution of the cholangitis with drainage and
antibiotics a laparotomy was performed. The right lobe of the liver was largely replaced by a multiloculated cyst and the bile duct
contained multiple hydatid daughter cysts. A right hepatectomy was performed with t-tube drainage of the evacuated bile duct. She made an
uneventful recovery and has had no problems on subsequent follow up. Histology confirmed an intrabiliary rupture of a hydatid liver cyst.
Cholangitis secondary to daughter cysts is a rare but recognised complication of hydatid liver cysts. Management of hydatid liver cysts by
formal resection is controversial but may be preferable in this situation.
