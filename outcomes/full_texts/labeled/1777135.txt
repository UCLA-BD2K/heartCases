Leiomyoma may originate at any anatomic location of smooth muscle in the genitourinary system. The kidney capsule is the most common site
for the genitourinary leiomyomas. Leiomyoma origination from the scrotum is rare. The previous reported cases presented as small, firm,
nontender, slowly enlarging freely movable masses within the scrotum. We report a case of leiomyoma of the tunica dartos, a benign lesion
arising from the wall of the left scrotum. It presented as a pedunculated lesion with a surface ulceration, which need to be differentiated
from squamous carcinoma of the scrotum. It was treated with a simple surgical excision.
