28-year-old female patient, who presented with melaena. Preoperative imaging showed an 8.5 cm diameter mass in the head of pancreas. There
was bleeding from the papilla of Vater at endoscopy and a highly vascular lesion on arteriography. The patient was submitted to proximal
pancreatoduodenectomy and remains symptom-free at 1 year follow-up.
