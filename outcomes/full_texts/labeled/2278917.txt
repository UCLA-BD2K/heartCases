is presented. She was admitted to the Hospital following an attack of acute cholecystitis. Ten days after vigorous conservative treatment
cholecystectomy was performed. The histological examination showed the presence of the gallbladder leiomyosarcoma. Primary sarcomas of the
gallbladder are rare, leiomyosarcoma being the most infrequent type, their preoperative diagnosis almost impossible and their prognosis
poor.
