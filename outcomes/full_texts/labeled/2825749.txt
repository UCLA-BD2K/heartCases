Regulation of insulin release and transmembrane Ca2+ fluxes was examined using pieces of 3 benign medullary-type insulinomas removed from
the pancreas of female patients at surgery. Immunocytochemical staining confirmed the presence of insulin-containing cells with no
demonstrable glucagon, somatostatin or pancreatic polypeptide. After 3 days of culture in RPMI-1640, tumour pieces released 11-158 mg
insulin kg-1 dry wt during acute 60 min incubations with the concomitant uptake of 2-47 mmol 45Ca kg-1 into the intracellular lanthanum-
nondisplaceable pool. At 2.56 mM Ca2+, glucose alone or in combination with glyceraldehyde, mannoheptulose or diazoxide did not modify
insulin release or 45Ca uptake. Theophylline significantly increased insulin release from 2 tumours with a small stimulatory effect on the
third. A depolarising concentration of K+ enhanced insulin release from one tumour but this was not associated with an increase of 45Ca
uptake. Calcium antagonists, (verapamil, D-600 and trifluoroperazine) and calcium ionophores (A23187 and Br-X537A) failed to modify insulin
release or 45Ca uptake by each of the two tumours tested. Evaluation of 45Ca efflux from one tumour confirmed the unresponsiveness to
glucose, K+, verapamil and A23187. Prolonged culture of 2 tumours for up to 16 days was associated with the gradual decline of insulin
release to a steady output of 2-15 ng 24 h-1. Addition of verapamil to the cultures inhibited insulin output from one tumour, but
mannoheptulose or diazoxide were without effect. The results indicate that inappropriate insulin release from these 3 benign medullary-type
insulinomas is associated with disturbances in the regulation of transmembrane Ca2+ fluxes.
