Grant Tl AM 05416. Five patients with concomitant endocrinopathy and slipped capital femoral epiphysis were studied in detail. One had
diabetes and hypothyroidism, one had hypothyroidism, one had hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and two had a craniopharyngioma (one of whom had
severe panhypopituitarism post-operatively). An additional seven patients with cranio-pharyngioma revealed marked delay in closure of
epiphyses and an additional undiagnosed case of slipped capital femoral epiphysis. Of the six patients with slipped capital femoral
epiphysis, three had bilateral and three unilateral involvement. Of the five patients undergoing surgical stabilization, there was
significant delay of epiphyseodesis, prompting us to recommend concomitant bone grafting. Histological examination of the femoral head from
a three year old child with panhypopituitarism showed marked irregularity of the growth plate and loss of columnar integrity, which may be a
predisposing factor to slipping in older children with endocrinopathies. The effects of various hormones on the physis are specifically
discussed, especially as they relate to the possible etiology of slipped capital femoral epiphysis.
