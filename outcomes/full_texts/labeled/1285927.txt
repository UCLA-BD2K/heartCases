A case of primary non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphoma of the vulva which occurred in a 68-year-old woman is presented. Non-Hodgkin's malignant
lymphoma is infrequently involved in the female genital tract. Moreover, primary vulvar involvement of this tumor is very rare. To date only
6 cases have been reported in the literature. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphoma of the
vulva in Korea.
