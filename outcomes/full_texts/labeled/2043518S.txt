Mycobacteriurn tuberculosis, but tuberculosis of the common bile duct has not previously been reported. A 38-year-old man with obstructive
jaundice, who was originally thought to have cholangiocarcinoma associated with opisthorchiasis (a common combination in Thailand), was
finally proved to have tuberculosis of the common bile duct with adjacent tuberculous lymphadenitis. Following T-tube drainage and
antitubercular therapy, he made a complete recovery. The importance of a tissue diagnosis in all cases of obstructive jaundice is emphasized
to avoid missing rare but curable diseases.
