A 39-year-old Korean man with general malaise was found to have two hepatic cysts by computed tomography. He had the history of close
contact with domesticated wild dog in Saudi Arabia in 1976. Two cysts, 15cm and 10cm in diameter which contained clear fluid, were excised
from both lobes of the liver. He was pathologically diagnosed as unilocular hydatid disease. This case is regarded as an imported case from
Saudi Arabia.
