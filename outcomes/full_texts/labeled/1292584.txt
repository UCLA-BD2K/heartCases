fistula after an operation for a giant hydatid cyst of the liver. Endoscopic sphincterotomy was inadequate to close the fistula. A
nasobiliary tube was selectively inserted into the leaking hepatic duct and bile was continuously aspirated. The fistula and the residual
cavity healed completely. Details of the patients' management using this alternative technique, are discussed.
