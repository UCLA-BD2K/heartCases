A case of melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy was presented. This tumor occurred in the right maxillary alveolar ridge of 3-month-old
female infant, showing bluish enlargement of alveolar mucosa with the displacement of central deciduous incisor. We described the gross,
microscopic, and ultrastructural findings of this tumor. This case appears to be the first case of MNTI, reported in a Korean.
