Five patients seen during a two-month period who developed untoward systemic reactions following high dose intravenous administration of
nafcillin are described. Recovery was complete upon discontinuation of the drug. The clustering of these cases and the high incidence (5 of
5) of side effects are highly unusual, and suggest that the frequency of nafcillin reactions might be higher than previously suspected.
