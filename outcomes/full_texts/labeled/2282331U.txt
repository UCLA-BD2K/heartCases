colorectal liver metastases. Two patients died of recurrent disease, 9–11 months after reresection. Three patients are alive, one without
and two with recurrent disease, 15, 15 and 68 months after reresection. Although our results suggest that liver reresection may be
meaningful in selected patients with colorectal liver metastases, further studies are necessary in order to define candidates for this
procedure.
