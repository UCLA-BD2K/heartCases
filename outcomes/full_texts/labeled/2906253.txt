Genetic studies have been made in two cases of primary choriocarcinoma from patients in whom the antecedent pregnancy was a hydatidiform
mole. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the DNA from the tumour, the patient and her partner were examined and in both cases the
tumours were shown to be androgenetic in origin, having only paternal polymorphisms. While one tumour was shown to be heterozygous, two
different paternal alleles being demonstrated with some probes, the other tumour was shown to be homozygous for all informative
polymorphisms examined. Thus choriocarcinoma can follow complete hydatidiform mole which may be either heterozygous or homozygous.
