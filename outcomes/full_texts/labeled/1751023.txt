Arteriovenous malformations of the uterus are extremely rare and they occur either in congenital or acquired forms. The most common clinical
presentation is abnormal uterine bleeding, which may be aggravated by therapeutic curettage. Because of their rare incidence and clinical
importance in management of patients, we report a case of arteriovenous malformation causing serious bleeding during a hysterectomy for
uterine leiomyoma. The patient was a 47-year-old multiparous woman who had a history of chronic vaginal bleeding for one year. Numerous
anomalous blood vessels draining into the right and left uterine arteries were found on the anterior wall of the uterus and parametrium.
