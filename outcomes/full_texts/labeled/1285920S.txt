A patient with a sciatic artery aneurysm, which is so rare that only 31 cases have been reported in the literature to date, was treated
successfully with transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) alone. Potentially risky and difficult surgery was avoided. This was the first
trial with a good result. TAE alone is simple, safe and effective method for the treatment of sciatic artery aneurysm either in incomplete
type or in complete type with adequate collateralization.
