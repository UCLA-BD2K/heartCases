A case of a man with Tourette's disorder associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder, multiple sexual paraphilias, and aggressive behavior
is described. Treatment with haloperidol led to improvement in the characteristic tics of Tourette's disorder as well as to improvement in
these three complex-associated behaviors. After haloperidol was discontinued, an exacerbation of tics and the associated behaviors occurred.
