Clear-cell chondrosarcoma, a recently specified entity, is a low-grade malignant tumor and has characteristic clinical, roentgenographic and
pathologic findings which separate it from conventional chondrosarcoma and other benign tumors. Therefore, correct diagnosis is important
from the viewpoint of both prognosis and therapeutic approach. We report a case of typical recurrent clear-cell chordirosarcoma. Typical
round cells with clear cytoplasm, large nuclei, and small nucleoli were wellnoted. The clear cytoplasm was faintly positive in PAS staining.
Electronmicroscopic study showed that these cells were of chondroid origin, showing indented nuclei, large dilated endoplasmic reticulum
cisternae, bundles of actin-like filaments and a few glycogen particles.
