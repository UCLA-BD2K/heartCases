We report a Korean family case of beta-thalassemia minor and Hb Queens. This is the first case report of Hb Queens in Korea. A 43-year-old
male and his four family members had beta-thalassemia minor which is very rare in Korea. Incidentally, an alpha chain variant with a high
isoelectric point was also found in two other family members without clinical problems and was finally identified as alpha 34 (B15) Leu-Arg
or Hemoglobin Queens.
