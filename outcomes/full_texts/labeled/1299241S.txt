A case of spinal meningeal melanocytoma is reported along with clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies. This
patient presented clinically with paraparesis, tingling sensation and numbness of both lower extremities of 4 months duration. No
mucocutaneous pigmented nevi were found. On operation, scattered coal-black pigmented lesions were found in the meninges between T3 and T4-5
interspace level. Nearly total removal was carried out. The tumor was composed of spindle and epithelioid cells with heavy brown-black
pigmentation. There was no pleomorphism, mitosis, hemorrhage, necrosis or invasion to the underlying cord tissue. In Korea, this case
appears to be the first example of this disease. Neurologic deficit improved after surgical excision.
