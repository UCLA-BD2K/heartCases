A case of retrograde intussusception (acute type) of efferent limb into Braun side-to-side jejuno-jejunal anastomosis is presented.
Intussusception, though infrequent, is well recognized complication after gastric surgery. Patient was 50 year old man who was admitted with
epigastric pain and abdominal mass for 6 hours. Patient had a history of total gastrectomy 2 years before admission due to stage II gastric
cancer. Seven hours after admission, hematemesis developed. Emergency fiberopticgastroscopy revealed type 4 jejunogastric intussusception.
Segmental resection with end-to-end reanastomosis was performed.
