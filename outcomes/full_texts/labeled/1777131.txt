Amebic colitis is a disease revealing diverse clinical manifestations and endoscopic gross features and often confused with other types of
colitis. In case of misdiagnosis as an idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease or delayed recognition of intestinal amebiasis, an undesirable
outcome may occur resulting from erroneous administration of steroids or delayed antiamebic treatment. To demonstrate the pitfalls in the
diagnosis and treatment of intestinal amebiasis, 3 cases of amebic colitis with atypical clinical manifestations are presented in this
paper. In conclusion, despite the low sensitivities of routine stool examination for parasite and histopathologic confirmation in biopsy
specimen, every effort must be made to find amebic trophozoites either in fresh stool or biopsy specimens for prompt and correct diagnosis
of amebic colitis when we manage patients with chronic intestinal ulcerations, even though their clinical course and endoscopic findings are
not typical of amebiasis. Moreover, following initial successful anti-amebic therapy, more careful clinical, endoscopical, and
parasitological follow-up should be done for the early detection of recurrence.
