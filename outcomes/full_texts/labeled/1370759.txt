In the last 2 years (1989-1990) we have treated a total of 53 patients with metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumours (teratoma). In ten
cases surgery to remove residual abdominal masses was required on completion of chemotherapy and normalisation of tumour markers (HCG and
AFP). In a further three patients with large intra-abdominal masses and little or no other sites of disease surgery was performed as a
therapeutic intervention, in the context of plateauing or rising tumour markers despite intensive chemotherapy. In all three, this approach
resulted in a rapid fall in tumour markers, and following further chemotherapy all three remain disease free at 7, 12 and 25 months. For
this small sub-group of patient failing to respond to chemotherapy who have resectable lesions, interventional surgery should be considered
as part of a combined approach to treatment.
