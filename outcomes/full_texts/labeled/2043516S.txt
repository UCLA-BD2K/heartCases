liver trauma, operative injury or disease. Such collections may be intrahepatic or extrahepatic and usually in the supramesocolic
compartment of the abdomen. This is a report of a retroperitoneal biloma, an entity that has been reported only twice to date but this is
the first secondary to an operative common bile duct lesion. Evacuation of the biloma and reconstruction of the associated biliary stricture
were successfully carried out. The patient remains sympton free with normal clinical and laboratory data more than 14 months after surgery.
Operative common bile duct (CBD) injury may be followed by a number of complications. To our knowledge retroperitoneal biloma secondary to a
CBD lesion has not been previously reported.
