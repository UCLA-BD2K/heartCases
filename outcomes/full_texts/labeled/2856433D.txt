liver is described. The 17-year-old Japanese male affected died of the disease 25 months after palliative operation. The diagnosis of FLC
had not been confirmed before autopsy. Pre-operative diagnosis of FLC is important to surgeons. Acccording to the literature, FLC is rare in
Asia. The endemic discrepancy may suggest that the carcinogenic factors are different from those of general hepatocellular carcinoma.
