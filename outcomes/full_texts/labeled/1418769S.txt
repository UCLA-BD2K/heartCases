POEMS syndrome is a multisystem disorder associated with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, a monoclonal protein (M-protein), and
skin changes. The authors describe a patient with POEMS syndrome who had osteosclerotic myeloma confirmed by open bone biopsy. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) showed discrete lesions of low signal intensity in both T1 and T2-weighted images. This patient is now being
successfully treated with melphalan and prednisone with much improvement in skin thickening and sensory change in the lower extremities.
