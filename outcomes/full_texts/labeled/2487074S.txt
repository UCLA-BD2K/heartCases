which has the potential for malignant transformation. Although reported more frequently nowadays, ampullary tumors are difficult to diagnose
before operation unless they cause obstructive jaundice. Occasionally they are detected by ultrasonography, computed tomography or ERCP in
patients who complain of nonspecific upper abdominal discomfort. We report a case of a periampullary papilotubular adenoma causing
generalized pruritus and weight loss but no jaundice. The tumor was extirpated by pancreaticoduodenectomy, and the patient has remained
healthy for over five years.
