A case of an intracerebral arteriovenous malformation that grew is presented. On the initial arteriogram only one early filling vein was
seen in the region where a large arteriovenous malformation was present eight years later. The patient's headaches were relieved by
antihypertensive medications. The authors speculate that distension of the AVM caused the headaches.
