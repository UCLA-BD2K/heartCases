usually diagnosed at laparotomy when it is associated with other visceral injuries. Isolated gallbladder rupture due to blunt abdominal
trauma is even rarer. The clinical presentation of gallbladder injury is variable, resulting in a delay in diagnosis and treatment.
Awareness to the possibilty of trauma to the extrahepatic biliary system enables early surgical intervention and eliminates the high
morbidity associated with delated diagnosis. A 5 year old child with isolated gallbladder rupture caused by blunt abdominal trauma is
presented.
