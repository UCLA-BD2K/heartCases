Giant cell tumors are distinctive neoplasms characterized by a profusion of multinucleate giant cells scattered throughout a stroma of
mononuclear cells. Most giant cell tumors are found at the epiphyses of long bones, especially around the knee joint. Flat bone involvement
is rare. However, a case of giant cell tumor with secondary aneurysmal bone cyst was encountered at the scapula of a 25-year-old man. Since
the occurrence of a giant cell tumor with secondary aneurysmal bone cyst on flat bones (i.e., the scapula) is extremely rare, the above-
mentioned case is worthy of reporting.
