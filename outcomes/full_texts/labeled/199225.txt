Cultured cells established from the bone marrow of a child with null-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) have been studied. After 8
months in vitro, the cytological, cytochemical and immunological properties of the cultured cells were very similar to those of the
patient's cells. Many of the cultured cells had morphological and cytogenetic abnormalities often found in acute leukaemia. The cells were
EBNA-negative. This unique culture of ALL-derived null cells might provide information as to the aetiology and origin of malignant cells.
