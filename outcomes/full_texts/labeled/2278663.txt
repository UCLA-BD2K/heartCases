We report a case of the intestinal lesion in Henoch-Schönlein purpura, presented with an acute abdomen in a 4 year old boy. Five days after
sudden colicky abdominal pain, skin purpura and painful joint swelling developed. These manifestations were associated with abdominal
distension, hematemesis, hematochezia and hematuria. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a marked bowel distension with edema and patchy dark
reddish discoloration of the jejunum and ileum. These patchy areas showed transmural hemorrhage and necrosis associated with characteristic
leukocytoclastic vasculitis in and around the hemorrhagic lesions. These vasculitis was thought to be related to Henoch-Schönlein purpura.
