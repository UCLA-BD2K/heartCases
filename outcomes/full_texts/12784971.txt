Although not common, acute leg ischemia is an important element in the clinical presentation of a patient with aortic dissection. This
report describes a case of aortic dissection in which the main feature at presentation was acute right leg ischemia. The angiography showed
right common iliac artery and external iliac artery occlusion. Diagnosis was made by clinical evaluation and angiography. Embolectomy was
then attempted immediately but failed. Aortic dissection was highly suspected and confirmed by emergency computed tomography. Fortunately,
the patient had good recovery. Aortic dissection is potentially lethal if misdiagnosed or if recognition is delayed. As such, aortic
dissection should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
