Syringomas are common intraepidermal sweat gland tumors most often found in women around the time of adolescence. Frequent sites of
involvement include the lower eyelids and malar areas, however vulvar involvement is relatively rare. These lesions often present as small,
multiple, skin-colored-to-yellowish papules and are often associated with increased vulvar discomfort and itching. We present a case of a
29-year old female who presented to her gynecologist complaining of vulvar itching and burning. A small condylomatous-type wart observed on
her vulva was biopsied and found to be a syringoma. Because of their clinical presentation and associated symptoms, vulvar syringomas should
be considered in the differential diagnosis of any multicentric papular lesion of the vulva, vulvar pain syndrome, and pruritis vulvae.
