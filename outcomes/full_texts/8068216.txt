We present a patient with Fanconi syndrome who demonstrated poor renal uptake of 99mTc-DMSA and high urinary concentration of the tracer. A
99mTc-DTPA scan was normal and the creatinine clearance only minimally decreased. These findings suggest that 99mTc-DMSA may be accumulated
in the kidney by glomerular filtration and subsequent tubular reabsorption, with the nonabsorbed fraction appearing in the urine. In Fanconi
Syndrome the tubular reabsorption of DMSA may also be reduced, thus explaining the poor renal uptake in this patient. A 99mTc-MDP bone scan
showed faint renal uptake and diffuse high uptake mainly in the spine, demonstrating that the metabolic bone disease associated with Fanconi
Syndrome can be another mechanism for poor renal visualization on bone scan.
