Analytically oriented psychotherapy (AOP) has been considered the treatment of choice for borderline patients and a useful technique in the
treatment of schizotypal patients. There are many exceptions, however, in addition to a number of borderline and schizotypal patients who
are just barely amenable to this modality: they are at the border of treatability by AOP. Limitations relating to time, cost, and the
availability of therapists trained in this discipline render it important to delineate the factors which conduce either to the success or
failure of AOP. From the author's clinical impressions about borderline and schizotypal patients at the border of treatability by AOP, a
number of such factors emerge. On the positive side: likeableness, autoplastic defenses, high motivation, psychological-mindedness, genuine
concern, good moral sense, self-discipline, and low impulsivity. Negative factors include, beside the opposites to the aforementioned,
vengefulness and parental abusiveness or exploitation. A scale for measuring the balance between these positive and negative factors is
proposed. Its use may, it is hoped, improve forecast, during initial consultation, as to which borderline and schizotypal patients will
respond favorably to AOP.
