A syringomatous adenoma of the nipple is a benign locally infiltrating neoplasm histologically similar to the syringoma of the skin.
Morphologically similar lesions have been described as adenoma of the nipple or florid papillomatosis. Patient was a 33 year old woman who
was admitted with a history of bloody nipple discharge from her right breast. With a clinical impression of Paget's disease explorative
mastectomy was performed. Microscopically typical tubular and duct like structures with syringomatoid features were present throughout the
stroma of the nipple.
