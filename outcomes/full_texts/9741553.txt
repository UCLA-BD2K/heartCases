We present a case of desmoplastic cerebral astrocytoma of infancy (DCAI) in a 9-month-old boy including immunohistochemical and
proliferative activity studies. It was mainly composed of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes and desmoplastic
stroma. Studies with Ki-67 and synthetic phase fraction disclosed a low proliferative activity. Flow cytometric study revealed diploidy
pattern. These findings suggest a positive correlation with the favorable prognosis.
