knee joint was completely pain free with important swelling. The radiological features were characteristic in the right knee joint with
complete destruction and slight at the left knee. The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of positive syphilis serology in the blood,
the joint fluid and the cerebrospinal fluid. The patient was treated by penicillin G. Tab√®s is a rare degenerative manifestation of tertiary
syphilis, affecting the posterior column of the spinal cord, occuring on an average of 15 years after contamination. Clinically it is
characterized by several manifestations including Charcot arthropathy. The pathophysiology of tabetic arthrpathy is complex. Clinically,
there is a significant joint deformation with spontaneous fracture dislocation contrasting with no pain, which delays the consultation and
therefore the management (case of our patient who consults after 4 years). The large joints of lower lumbs are its elective location.
Orthopedic treatment remains disappointing and management is based on intravenous penicillin G. Value of the prevention, screening and the
early treatment of syphilis in order to avoid such a dreaded complication. Hydarthrosis of the right knee
