Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of refractory anemias resulting from a clonal stem cell disorder often associated with
cytogenetic abnormalities. There is increasing recognition of immunological abnormalities in patients with MDS, including defective B- and
T-cell function, hyper- or hypogammaglobulinemia and monoclonal gammopathy. MDS have been associated with Sj√∂gren's syndrome, polymyalgia
rheumatica, relapsing polychondritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Although there may be various rheumatologic features, including acute
arthritis in MDS, chronic inflammatory arthritis is uncommonly combined. There have been a few reports that described cases of rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) concurrent with MDS, but advanced rheumatoid arthritis with typical joint deformities has rarely been reported. We report a
case of rheumatoid arthritis with atlantoaxial subluxation combined with refractory anemia in a 31-year-old woman.
