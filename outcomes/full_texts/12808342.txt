We report a three-year-old Korean boy who presented with itching symmetrical erythematous macules and papules on his face, trunk, and
extremities for 1 week. Lymphadenopathies were detected on physical examination. He was vaccinated against Japanese B Encephalitis (JE) 1
day before developing skin rashes. The patient s serum JE antibody titer by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) test was 1:40. Under the diagnosis
of Gianotti-Crosti syndrome following JE vaccination, he was conservatively treated with an antihistamine agent, and his symptoms were all
cleared 2 weeks after treatment.
