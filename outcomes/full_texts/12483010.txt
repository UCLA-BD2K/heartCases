A 25-yr-old woman presented with a right pleural effusion. Destruction of 9th through 12th ribs, adjacent vertebral bodies, and transverse
processes was noted on plain radiograph and a large low-attenuated, irregular shaped mass lesion with peripheral rim enhancement, destroying
vertebral body and transverse process, was revealed on the computed tomographic scan. Magnetic resonance imaging showed high signal on T1-
weighted image and iso- and low signal on T2-weighted image for the mass lesion replacing the vertebral bony cortex and marrow space. An
open rib biopsy revealed the histopathological changes of Gorham's disease (essential osteolysis), even though only bloody fluid filling the
empty space and rib and vertebral transverse process destruction were grossly observed on operation. Even though there was no definite
response to radiotherapy and pleurodesis, the patient showed stable condition up to 20 months after diagnosis.
