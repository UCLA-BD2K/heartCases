Isolated granulocytic sarcoma (GS) has rarely been reported in a patient who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We report here a patient who developed an isolated GS after achieving hematologic and cytogenetic
remission by donor lymphocyte infusion for the relapse of CML following BMT. The size of GS was slightly decreased after local irradiation
of 1,500 cGy without further systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy. He remained in hematologic and cytogenetic remission without systemic
relapse of CML for 8 months. Thereafter, he died of sepsis. The appropriate treatment of GS and impact of its occurrence on prognosis
following allogeneic BMT has yet to be determined.
