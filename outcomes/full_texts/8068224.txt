Adult presentation of congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation(CCAM) of the lung is so rare that only 5 cases have been reported in the
literature to date. We report the case of a 19-year-old female with CCAM in the left lower lobe. Computed tomography showed a multilobulated
cystic lesion with multiple air-fluid levels and also showed focal enhancement of the solid component in the eccentrical portion of the
lesion. Thoracic aortogram and selected bronchial arteriograms show a slightly enlarged and tortuous bronchial artery feeding the
multilobulated cystic lesion. We present the clinical and radiological features of our case with a brief review of the literature.
