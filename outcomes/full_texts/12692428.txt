The incidence of posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) has increased in recent years. Although rare, various types of
T-cell lymphoma have been reported and their association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been compared with B-cell PTLDs. We report a case
of splenic peripheral T-cell lymphoma occurring in a 47-yr-old male patient 7 yr after renal allograft transplantation. The spleen showed
sinusoidal proliferation of focal CD30 positive, large, atypical lymphoid cells. Positivity for CD3 and cytolytic granule-associated
proteins was also demonstrated in the tumor cells, while anaplastic large cell lymphoma kinase (ALK) and CD8 were not expressed. Strong
nuclear signals for EBV mRNA were noted by EBER1 in situ hybridization. A molecular genetic study demonstrated a rearrangement of the gamma
T-cell receptor gene. To our knowledge, this case is unique in terms of a posttransplant T-cell lymphoma that shows focal CD30, cytolytic
granule-associated proteins, and EBV positivity.
