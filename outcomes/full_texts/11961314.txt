Tetanus is uncommon in Korea due to the introduction of vaccination programs and advances in public health. A case of maternal tetanus
occurred on the 9 day postpartum in a 29-yr-old woman, who had not received a 10-yr-booster of tetanus-diphtheria toxoid after receiving the
primary series of tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccine. There has hitherto been no reports on maternal tetanus in Korea. This case illustrates
that tetanus remains a medical problem, principally among non- and under-immunized adults. The only way to fully prevent this disease is to
ensure adequate immunization in all adults.
