A 55-year old woman was referred to the department of medicine, GATA Haydarpasa Teaching Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey, in January 2013 with
dyspnoea and chest pain. The patient's complaints were present for a long time (8-10 yr) but she did not consult the doctor. In her medical
history there was mediastinal mass surgery when she was 30 years old. On the chest X-ray, evident cardiomegaly was seen. Echocardiography
showed dilation in all heart chambers. There was decreased ejection fraction compatible with heart failure. On the contrast-enhanced chest
computerized tomography (CECT), cardiomegaly and pulmonary artery dilatation were observed. In addition, all pulmonary veins of the left
lung and some pulmonary veins of the right lung have joined to form an anomalous ascendant vertical vein in the subcarinal area (Fig. 1A,
B). The vertical vein passing through the aortapulmonary window was localized adjacent to the left aortic arch. Consequently, it was seen
draining into the left brachiocephalic vein. Some of the right lung pulmonary veins were draining into the right atrium (Fig. 2A, B). A
diagnosis of partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR) was made. The patient was only treated for heart failure. The axial CECT
shows a vertical vein (arrows) adjacent to the left aortic arch (A) and left main brochus anteriorly (B). In addition, dilatation of the
main pulmonary artery is seen. (A) The coronal CT image showing the vertical vein. The decreased caliber of vertical vein is seen at the
level of the aortapulmonary window (arrows). Left upper lobe pulmonary vein is seen draining into the vertical vein (arrow head). (B) The
right lower lobe pulmonary vein (double arrows) is seen draining into the left atrium (asterisk). Bifurcation of vertical vein is also seen
(thick arrow).
