We report the case of a 20-year-old female with lymphoma of the breast. Mammography showed an asymmetric pattern of confluent densities
without any discrete mass. Sonography revealed diffuse heterogenous echoic mass intermingled with low-and medium level echoes. We present
the clinical, radiographic and histologic features of primary breast lymphoma with a brief review of the literatures.
