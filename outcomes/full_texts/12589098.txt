We report an unbalanced translocation involving chromosome 2 and 7 due to a balanced reciprocal translocation 2;7 in the father. The female
fetus had a partial trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 2 with a partial monosomy of distal 7q. Ultrasound at the first trimester had
indicated normal fetal anatomy, including normal intracranial structures. Parental karyotypes showed a paternal balanced translocation:
46,XY,t(2;7)(q37.3;-->q34). The unbalanced translocation in the fetus resulted in trisomy for 2q37.3 qter and monosomy for 7q34-->qter.
Postnatal examination showed that the female abortus had a cleft lip and palate, and mild dysmorphic features. The clinical phenotype was in
agreement with previous descriptions and allowed us to propose a fetal phenotype for this chromosomal abnormality.
