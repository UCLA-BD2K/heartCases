A 59-year-old man with a history of chronic ankylosing spondylitis for many years, developed neck pain and left cervico-brachial neuralgia
following a road traffic accident sustained one week before. Plain radiographs of cervical spine were initially misinterpreted. On
examination, he had severe neck pain on mobilization without any neurological deficits. Delayed cervical computed tomography scan showed
ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament, calcification of the intervertebral discs and complete vertebral fusion (so called
bamboo spine) with transversal fracture at C5-C6 disc level (so called carrot-stick fracture) causing a luxation of the cervical spine with
significant compromise in canal space (A and B). A transcranial spinal traction was performed followed by anterior decompression and
stabilization via an anterolateral cervical approach. The outcome was favourable. Transverse fractures of the spine are rare in patients
with ankylosing spondylitis and diagnosis should be considered following even minor trauma. These atypical unstable fractures occur because
of the loss of flexibility and fragility of the osteoporotic spine. Early diagnosis for possible intervention is important because of the
high mortality rate. Cervical computed tomography scan on sagittal (A) and axial (B) views revealing ossification of the anterior
longitudinal ligament, calcification of the intervertebral discs and complete vertebral fusion (bamboo spine) with transdiscal fracture at
C5-C6 level causing a luxation of the cervical spine with significant compromise in canal space
