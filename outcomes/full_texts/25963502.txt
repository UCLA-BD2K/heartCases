A 70 year old male patient diagnosed with ventricular tachycardia and dilated cardiomyopathy maintained on oral amiodarone (200 mg/day)
since past five years, presented to Advanced Eye Centre, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India in
December 2013. His chief complaints included glare and diminution of vision. The best corrected visual acuity was 20/60 and 20/40 in right
(OD) and left (OS) eyes, respectively. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy showed corneal deposits forming a horizontal streak in OD (Figure A) and
classical arborizing pattern resembling cat's whiskers in OS (Figure B). There was senile nuclear cataract in both eyes. Plasma amiodarone
levels were normal (1.8 Î¼g/ml) without systemic toxicity. Withdrawal of amiodarone and surgery for implantable cardioverter defibrillator
(ICD) was planned. The patient was unable to afford ICD, so amiodarone was continued in lower dose (150 mg/day). Three months follow up
revealed a similar picture. A: Slit-lamp examination of the right cornea shows presence of discrete, linear, arborizing pattern of corneal
epithelial deposits of amiodarone. The deposits are located in the stroma of the cornea (white arrow). B. A slit-lamp photograph with slit
illumination of the left eye shows classical pattern of deposition of amiodarone. The deposition is more as compared to the right eye and is
forming a whorl-like pattern (white arrow) due to the epithelial growth pattern. The authors acknowledge the contribution of Dr Jaidrath
Kumar, Department of Ophthalmology, Advanced Eye Centre, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh.
