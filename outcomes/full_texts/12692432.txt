Nephrotic syndrome has been described as one of the clinical forms of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), but a limited number of
cases have been described. We experienced a young female patient with nephrotic syndrome developed 22 months after allogeneic hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for severe aplastic anemia. She had been well after successful management for gut-limited cGVHD until she
developed a clinical nephrotic syndrome with hypoalbuminemia of 2.0 g/dL and 24-hr urine protein of 6.88 g/dL. On physical examination and
laboratory findings, there was no other evidence of cGVHD. Clinical and renal biopsy findings were consistent with cGVHD-related membranous
nephropathy, and immunosuppressive agents with cyclosporine and prednisone were prescribed. After 3 month of treatment, the proteinuria
decreased to normal range; and the patient from nephrotic syndrome nearly recovered. We recommend cGVHD-related glomerulonephritis should be
considered in all patients with hypoalbuminemia following allogeneic HSCT, even if there is no other evidence of clinical GVHD.
