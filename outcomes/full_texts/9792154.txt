We report a Li-Fraumeni syndrome family in which we have detected a splice acceptor mutation in intron 3 of TP53. The mutation affects one
of the invariant residues at the splice acceptor site, as a result of which two aberrant transcripts are produced. A child with Wilms'
tumour aged 3 years in this family was shown not to be a mutation carrier.
