Metastasis of breast carcinoma to the stomach is relatively uncommon, although metastasis to other organs such as lung, bone, and lymph
nodes is not rare. It may cause difficulty in differentiating from primary gastric carcinoma. We report a case of signet ring cell carcinoma
of the breast with metastasis to the stomach with illustrations of histologic findings of both lesions. The results of immunohistochemical
stainining with GCDFP-15 (gross cystic disease fluid protein-15), that can be used to differentiate primary gastric signet ring cell
carcinoma and metastatic mammary signet ring cell carcinoma, are described.
