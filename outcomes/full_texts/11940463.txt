Hair analysis is used to assess exposure to heavy metals in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms and is a commonly used procedure
in patients referred to our clinic. We are frequently called on to evaluate patients who have health-related concerns as a result of hair
analysis. Three patients first presented to outside physicians with nonspecific, multisystemic symptoms. A panel of analytes was measured in
hair, and one or more values were interpreted as elevated. As a result of the hair analysis and other unconventional diagnostic tests, the
patients presented to us believing they suffered from metal toxicity. In this paper we review the clinical efficacy of this procedure within
the context of a patient population with somatic disorders and no clear risk factors for metal intoxication. We also review limitations of
hair analysis in this setting; these limitations include patient factors such as low pretest probability of disease and test factors such as
the lack of validation of analytic techniques, the inability to discern between exogenous contaminants and endogenous toxicants in hair, the
variability of analytic procedures, low interlaboratory reliability, and the increased likelihood of false positive test results in the
measurement of panels of analytes.
