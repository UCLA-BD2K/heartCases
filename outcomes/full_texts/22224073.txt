We report the fifth case in the English literature of a horseshoe kidney with a complete ureteral duplication. Our case is unique in that
the previous four cases occurred in the presence of a ureterocele, whereas our patient lacked this anomaly. Further, our patient was managed
conservatively, whereas the previous four patients were managed with surgery.
