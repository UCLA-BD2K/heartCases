Trichosporonosis is a potentially life-threatening infection with Trichosporon beigelii, the causative agent of white piedra. The systemic
infection by this fungus has been most frequently described in immunocompromised hosts with neutropenia. Here, we report the first patient
with disseminated infection by T. beigelii in Korea, acquired during a period of severe neutropenia after chemo-therapy for myelodysplastic
syndrome. The patient recovered from the infection after an early-intensified treatment with amphotericin B and a rapid neutrophil recovery.
The disseminated infection by T. beigelii is still rare, however, is an emerging fatal mycosis in immunocompromised patients with severe
neutropenia.
