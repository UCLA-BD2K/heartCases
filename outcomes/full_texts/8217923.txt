undergoing operation from 1976 to 1989 were reviewed. To clarify the reason for failure to respond to conventional supportive therapy, 73
patients (68%) who underwent emergency surgery were retrospectively divided into two groups according to the severity of the pancreatitis
evaluated at laparotomy and compared. Sixty-two had minimal or mild pancreatitis (Group I), among whom 44 (71%) had life-threatening acute
biliary tract disease. All underwent biliary surgery and 4 (6%) subsequently died, 2 due to acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis.
Eleven had hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis (Group II), among whom 7 had complications of acute pancreatitis such as pancreatic ascites
or abscess. These underwent pancreatic and/or biliary surgery and 3 (27%) died of multi-organ failure. There appears to be two types of
biliary pancreatitis refractory to conventional supportive therapy, which differ in the extent of surgery required and in mortality: (1)
minimal or mild pancreatitis with persistent life-threatening acute biliary tract disease (biliary type), and (2) more severe pancreatitis
(pancreas type) early in the course of the disease.
