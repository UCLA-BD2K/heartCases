A case report of transverse myelitis and optic neuritis is presented in which the latter occurred following a myelogram with iopamidol. The
literature relating to neurotoxicity of contrast agents is reviewed, and it is suggested that the optic neuritis may have been a neurotoxic
effect of iopamidol.
