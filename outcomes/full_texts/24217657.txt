A 52-year-old man with diffuse large B cell lymphoma was admitted to the intensive care unit with septic shock. He had been chronically ill
with limited recovery following internal fixation for a pathologic left tibial fracture and had been residing in a long-term acute care
hospital. A peripherally inserted central catheter was placed in the right upper extremity 1 month prior. The catheter was removed upon
admission. While imaging the patient’s veins for vascular access, gas emboli were noted in the left internal jugular vein. These emboli are
recognized as hyperechoic bubbles in the superior aspect of the vessel, with reverberation artifact extending deeper than the vessel
(Fig. 1; Supplementary material 1). These emboli were present in the superior portion of the vein, extending above the angle of the jaw. At
the time of imaging, the patient had been placed in the reverse Trendelenburg position, with slight right-side dependency. The right
internal jugular vein had no evidence of air embolism. The patient experienced no adverse effects from the air embolism. It is suspected
that these emboli inadvertently occurred through routine access of his catheter with intravenous flushes. Iatrogenic gas embolism is
associated with increased mortality, and is typically treated with hyperbaric oxygen .Fig. 1Gas emboli in the left internal jugular vein
