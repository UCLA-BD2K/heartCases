Sulfite is commonly used in pharmaceuticals as a preservative. We report a unique clinical presentation of localized periorbital edema on
the left eye after administration of sulfite-containing dexamethasone. The patient's sulfite sensitivity was confirmed by sulfite oral
provocation test: periorbital edema on the same site developed after ingestion of 200 mg sodium bisulfite. She was non-atopic and did not
complain of any respiratory symptoms. Allergy skin prick test with 100 mg/ml sodium bisulfite showed a negative result. She also has
aspirin-sensitive urticaria which was confirmed by oral provocation test. In conclusion, sulfite can induce a localized periorbital edema,
an uncommon manifestation in sensitive patients. Further investigations are needed to clarify the pathogenetic mechanisms.
