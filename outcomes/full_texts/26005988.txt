Here we present the first video demonstration of reduction corporoplasty in the management of phallic disfigurement in a 17 year old man
with a history sickle cell disease and priapism. Surgical management of aneurysmal dilation of the corpora has yet to be defined in the
literature. Materials and Methods: We preformed bilateral elliptical incisions over the lateral corpora as management of aneurysmal dilation
of the corpora to correct phallic disfigurement. The patient tolerated the procedure well and has resolution of his corporal disfigurement.
Reduction corporoplasty using bilateral lateral elliptical incisions in the management of aneurysmal dilation of the corpora is a safe an
feasible operation in the management of phallic disfigurement. ARTICLE INFO ARTICLE INFO Available at:

al., the authors nicely depict a surgical technique of reduction corporoplasty using bilateral lateral elliptical incisions in the
management of aneurysmal dilation of the corpora cavernosa. This surgical approach is both novel and nicely depicted by the authors. In the
continual goal of penile reconstructive surgery to preserve/optimize penile length and functionality, the present surgical approach adds to
our present surgical. The merits of this versus other techniques are ultimately at the discretion of the surgeon appreciating his personal
surgical outcomes with a given technique weighed along with the expectations and treatment goals of the individual patient.
