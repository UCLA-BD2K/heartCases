We report a first Korean case of presumably dominantly inherited primary tubular aggregate myopathy in a 19-yr-old man, who presented with
slowly progressive proximal muscle stiffness and weakness. In hematoxylin and eosin stain, it showed subsarcolemmal, or central pale
basophilic granular vacuoles, which stained red with modified Gomori's trichrome and intensive blue with nicotinamide adenonine
dinucleotide-tetrazolium reductase, respectively. Ultrastructurally, aggregates of 60 nm-sized hexagonal tubules were found in both type 1
and type 2 fibers. We briefly review the pathologic findings of the previously reported cases of tubular aggregate myopathy and discuss the
possible pathogenesis of this disease. We briefly discuss the possible pathogenesis of sarcoplasmic reticulum and review the ultrastructural
characteristics.
