A case of histiocytic medullary reticulosis with splenic infaraction from a 23-year-old male is presented. Radiologic findings on selective
spleen scintigraphy and abdominal CT are described. Selective spleen scintigraphy showed huge, multilobulated spleen with numerous photon-
deficient areas in it and peripherally. Abdominal CT showed large peripheral band-like low density and infiltrative lesion in spleen with
accompanying intraabdominal lymphadenopathy. Histoligical features were consistent with HMR in spleen and liver specimens.
