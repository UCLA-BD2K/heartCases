Ureteral fibroepithelial polyp is an unusual benign tumor of a mesodermal origin. It is very rare in infants and children, and the majority
of them, excluding ones secondary to chronic irritation, were presented as a single disease without associated lesion. We report a case of
multiple ureteral fibroepithelial polyps associated with ureteropelvic junction obstruction in a 5 year-old boy.
