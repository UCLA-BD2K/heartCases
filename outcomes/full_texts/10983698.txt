Extramedullary hematopoiesis occurring in multiple organs such as thorax, liver and both kidneys is an unusual condition. We report the CT
findings of this condition with review of literature. The lesions consisted of intrathoracic paravertebral masses, focal intrahepatic mass
and masses of both pelvocalyceal systems on CT scans.
