Amongst neurological complications of rubella virus infection, polyradiculoneuritis as well as encephalitis is very rare. Only one case of
postrubella polyradiculoneuritis combined with encephalitis has been reported to our knowledge. A 17-years-old male presented with suspected
meningoencephalitis in a recent epidemic of rubella in a southern district of Korea. He developed symmetrical hyporeflexic weakness of all
four extremities with urinary disturbance several days later. Rubella IgM antibody titer (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) was 58 AU/mL in
serum and 12 AU/mL in cerebrospinal fluid. Electrophysiologic studies showed peripheral polyradiculoneuropathy with multifocal conduction
block. Considering the involvement of the central nerve as well as the peripheral nerve in an adult patient, this case is thought to be
valuable in view of the pathophysiology of neurologic complication in rubella virus infection.
