We report a rare case of neuro-Behcet's disease (NBD) presenting as an inflammatory pseudotumor in the brain. A 52-year-old woman was
evaluated for subacute dizziness and headache. Brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed a right cerebellar mass, which disappeared 2
weeks later. After a year, recurrent mucocutaneous manifestations of Beh et's disease were observed. Immunosuppressant and steroid
maintenance treatment were started. She experienced two more neurologic attacks and brain MR imaging revealed an enhancing mass in the right
temporal lobe. The second attack showed a good response to steroid pulse therapy, but the third attack did not respond to steroid and her
neurologic signs suggested an impending transtentorial hernia. The right temporal lobectomy was performed for the purpose of life-saving.
The pathologic finding of the mass was a chronic inflammatory vasculitis, compatible with NBD.
