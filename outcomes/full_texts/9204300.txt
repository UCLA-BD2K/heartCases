We investigated two fatal cases of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infection in a community nursing home in western Sydney,
Australia. Two elderly women had lived in the same room, and the onset of their illness was 5 days apart. Hib isolates from blood cultures
showed identical profiles by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. These findings suggest that Hib infection was transmitted within this nursing
home. Serious Hib disease may be underrecognized in this setting. Continued surveillance and serotyping of invasive H. influenzae disease is
essential for identifying groups at increasing risk that may benefit from immunization against Hib.
