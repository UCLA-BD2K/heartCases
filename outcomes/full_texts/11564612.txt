Use of elemental mercury in certain cultural and religious practices can cause high exposures to mercury vapor. Uses include sprinkling
mercury on the floor of a home or car, burning it in a candle, and mixing it with perfume. Some uses can produce indoor air mercury
concentrations one or two orders of magnitude above occupational exposure limits. Exposures resulting from other uses, such as infrequent
use of a small bead of mercury, could be well below currently recognized risk levels. Metallic mercury is available at almost all of the 15
botanicas visited in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, but botanica personnel often deny having mercury for sale when approached by
outsiders to these religious and cultural traditions. Actions by public health authorities have driven the mercury trade underground in some
locations. Interviews indicate that mercury users are aware that mercury is hazardous, but are not aware of the inhalation exposure risk. We
argue against a crackdown by health authorities because it could drive the practices further underground, because high-risk practices may be
rare, and because uninformed government intervention could have unfortunate political and civic side effects for some Caribbean and Latin
American immigrant groups. We recommend an outreach and education program involving religious and community leaders, botanica personnel, and
other mercury users.
