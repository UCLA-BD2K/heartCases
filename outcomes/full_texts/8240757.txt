Central core disease is a rare congenital myopathy characterized by the formation of "cores" that consist of abnormal arrangement of
myofibrils inside the myofibers. We report a 5-year-old Korean girl who showed a fairly typical clinical course of non-progressive muscle
weakness. Electrodiagnostic studies showed low-amplitude polyphasic electromyograph and normal nerve conduction velocity. Gastrocnemius
muscle biopsy showed central cores in over 80% of the fibers on H&E section. Histochemistry revealed deficient or absent mitochondrial
enzyme in the cores and type I predominance. Ultrastructurally both structured and non-structured cores were found separately or
simultaneously in one fiber. This case is the first report in the Korean literature.
