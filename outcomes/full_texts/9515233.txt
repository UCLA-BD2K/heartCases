secondary to diffuse thrombosis of the portal, superior mesenteric and splenic veins. Mesenteric angiography demonstrated patency of the
inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) in each, and successful portal decompression by anastomosis of the IMV to the left renal vein (n=4) or the
inferior vena cava (n=1) was accomplished. Bleeding was permanently controlled: four patients have survived from one to eight years post-
operatively. Because shunt procedures utilizing the IMV are technically straightforward, subtotally decompress the portal system and avoid
the right upper quadrant, they may be advantageous in certain clinical settings.
