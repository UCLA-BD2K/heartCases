Illustrated is a brief vignette highlighting the benefits of neonatal tongue tie release. Sir, A 4-week-old male infant was referred by his
midwife with difficulty breastfeeding, poor weight gain and the mother reported nipple pain. There was also a history of inadequate latching
during attempted suckling compromising milk transfer. Examination revealed short frenulum linguae with the resultant inability to protrude
the tongue over the lower alveolar ridge and notching of the tongue tip [Figure 1]. Following release of the tongue-tie (frenotomy) without
anaesthetic or undue discomfort to the infant the mother was able to return to normal breastfeeding with a subjective relief in nipple pain.

findings with a reported incidence amongst newborn infants of up to 4.8%. There is still much dubiety amongst clinicians as to the perceived
benefit of such a procedure with consequent variation in clinical practice. Current National Institute of Clinical Excellence guidance
suggests that the evidence is adequate to support the use of division. Medical Illustration Department. Royal Bolton Hospital.
