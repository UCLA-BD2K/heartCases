We tested serum specimens from three groups of patients with pneumonia by indirect immunofluorescence against Legionella-like amoebal
pathogens (LLAPs) 1-7, 9, 10, 12, 13; Parachlamydia acanthamoeba strains BN 9 and Hall's coccus; and Afipia felis. We found that LLAPs play
a role (albeit an infrequent one) in community-acquired pneumonia, usually as a co-pathogen but sometimes as the sole identified pathogen.
