After percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) closure with the Amplatzer cardiac plug (ACP), an intriguing image in the shape of the number
eight (figure-of-eight) is frequently observed on electrocardiography. This phenomenon is an image artifact that results from an interaction
between the metal mesh of the ACP and the ultrasound waves1. This finding should not be interpreted as a sign of incorrect ACP implantation.

72-year-old female patient who underwent percutaneous LAA closure with the ACP. (A) Transthoracic echocardiographic image in the 5-chamber
apical plane with the figure-of-eight image (arrow) in the left atrium (LA); (B) Increased anterior inclination of the transducer and
visualization of the figure-of-eight; (C) Transthoracic echocardiographic image in the 3-chamber parasternal plane; (D) Transesophageal
echocardiographic image with the figure-of-eight in the 5° projection (left), but not in the 95° projection (right) of the LAA.
