A full-term infant presented with severe abdominal distention. Supine radiograph of the chest and abdomen show a large rim-calcified mass
representing a meconium pseudocyst (Fig. 1, thick arrows). The irregular linear calcifications, mostly in the left upper quadrant, are
calcified meconium in the peritoneal cavity adherent to bowel walls (small arrow). Surgical and pathological findings confirmed small bowel
obstruction secondary to segmental volvulus with walled-off small-bowel perforation and pseudocyst formation. Fig. 1Supine radiograph of the
chest and abdomen Supine radiograph of the chest and abdomen Meconium peritonitis is caused by antenatal bowel perforation with spillage of
meconium into the peritoneum causing a sterile peritonitis and formation of dystrophic calcifications . Common causes of bowel obstruction
and perforation include meconium ileus, bowel atresia, and segmental volvulus. When the extruded meconium becomes walled off, it can form a
rim-calcified mass representing meconium pseudocyst . Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons
