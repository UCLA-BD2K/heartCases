Diffuse hepatic hemangiomatosis without extrahepatic lesions is extremely rare in adults. A case of diffuse hepatic hemangiomatosis
involving right lobe in a 50-year-old woman was presented. The hemangiomatosis was demonstrated by ultrasonography, computerized tomography
(CT) and magnetic resonance image (MRI), and was confirmed histopathologically. Although diffuse hepatic hemangiomatosis is a rare disease
in adults, its diagnosis should be considered in patients with diffuse tumor growth in one or both hepatic lobes and distinguished from
malignant tumors. The present case is the first documented case of diffuse hepatic hemangiomatosis in an adult in Korea.
