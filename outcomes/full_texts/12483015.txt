We report a case of giant cell tumor originating from the anterior arc of the rib. The tumor and the surrounding chest wall were completely
resected, and the chest wall defect was covered with Marlex mesh. Giant cell tumor of the bone usually originates from the epiphysis of long
bones. Even when the tumor occur in ribs, it usually occur in the posterior aspect. However, giant cell tumor should be included in the
differential diagnosis of a tumor originating from the anterior arc of the ribs.
