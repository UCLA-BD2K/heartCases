A 27-year-old Puerto Rican man presented to Yale-New Haven Hospital with a six-week history of left-sided headache, diplopia, and drooping
of the left side of his face. Cerebrospinal fluid examination showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis and a CT scan of the brain revealed an
unusual intrapontine mass lesion requiring systemic antifungal therapy. This case emphasizes many of the diagnostic and therapeutic
considerations required for effective therapy of fungal disease in the central nervous system.
