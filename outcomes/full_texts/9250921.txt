A laparoscopic approach was used for penile revascularization in a patient with vasculogenic impotence to avoid the long abdominal incision
which was traditionally required to harvest the inferior epigastric artery as a neoarterial source. Despite the time-consuming nature of
laparoscopy, this procedure was as efficacious but less morbid and required less convalescence than open revascularization. Whether more
patients may benefit from this procedure must be evaluated in further studies.
