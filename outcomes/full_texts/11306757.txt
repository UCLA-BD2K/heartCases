Branchio-oto-dysplasia is characterized by abnormalities of embryonic branchial arch system and deafness inherited as autosomal dominant
with variable gene expression. We present a rare case of multiple intracranial aneurysms associated with branchio-oto-dysplasia. A 40-yr-old
man with severe headache presented as spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage on brain computed tomographic scan. The patient also manifested
clinical features of branchio-oto-dysplasia and right hemifacial hypoplasia. Carotid angiogram confirmed an aneurysm in the anterior
communicating artery. Intraoperative findings demonstrated multiple aneurysms in the anterior communicating artery and in the left posterior
communicating artery, which were clipped successfully. Postoperative course was uneventful. This condition has not been reported previously.
We also reviewed literatures to discuss whether the intracranial aneurysm was as a coincidental finding or a part of this malformation.
