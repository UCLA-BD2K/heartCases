in patients with portal hypertension. We report a patient with cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis, who had a massive bleed from antral and
duodenal varices. Bleeding was controlled with endoscopic injection of varices using histoacryl. Endoscopic treatment and the relatively
uncommon occurrence of antral and duodenal varices are highlighted.
