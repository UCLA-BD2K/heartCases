A case of primary cerebral leiomyoma in a 12 year-old boy with unique clinical features is described. He presented with fever, and the
magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a well demarcated mass in the subcortical white matter of the right temporal lobe. The mass showed
low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images with a strong homogeneous gadolinium-DTPA
enhancement. The mass was removed in toto and was composed of fasciculating, monotonous oval to spindle cells which had both
immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features of primitive smooth muscle differentiation. The patient is free of recurrence during the
follow-up period of 56 months. Detailed clinicopathologic findings are discussed.
