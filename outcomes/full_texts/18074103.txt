We report on headache caused by the pesticide Antracol Combi WP 76. A headache caused by handling of pesticides should be distinguishable
from migraine and headaches from other causes. This 29-year-old woman, who handled pesticides, presented with very strong headache with
nausea and vomiting. Poisoning by this pesticide cannot be proven toxicologically, and there is no antidote. Following isolation from the
pesticide and abundant hydration, the pain gradually decreased. History, clinical signs and neuroradiological examinations excluded other
possible causes of the headache. In treatment of patients in rural areas, attention should also be paid to the pesticide Antracol Combi WP
76 as a possible cause of headaches
