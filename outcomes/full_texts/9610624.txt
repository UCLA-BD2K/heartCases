Malignant mixed m√ºllerian tumors (MMMT) are unusual neoplasms occurring mostly in the uterus. In the ovary, they are very rare and represent
fewer than 1% of all ovarian malignancies; in the salpinx, they are even rarer than those of the ovary. We report a carcinosarcoma of the
left adnexa having features of neuroendocrine differentiation in a 69-year-old female. The tumor contained both adenocarcinoma and squamous
cell carcinoma having dear cell change admixed with an undifferentiated malignant mesenchymal component. The sarcoma components consisted of
spindle cells, small-round cells and bizarre giant cells mimicking rhabdomyoblast. Almost all of the carcinomatous glandular components and
some foci of the squamous cell and undifferentiated carcinomatous components were focal positive for S-100 protein, chromogranin, neuron
specific enolase, synaptophysin and Leu-7. Electron microscopy revealed membrane-bound neurosecretory granules in the cytoplasm of some
glandular epithelial cells. Histologically, the tumor involved the left adnexa, abdominal peritoneum, surface of the bladder dome, omentum
and left external iliac lymph node (stage IIIc).
