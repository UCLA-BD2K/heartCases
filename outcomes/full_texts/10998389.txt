An immunocompetent patient was dually infected with a resistant and a multidrug-resistant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). The
multidrug-resistant strain, which belongs to the W- strain/Beijing family, was first isolated after 3 months of therapy. Inappropriate
treatment led to further drug resistance and unsuccessful therapy. Thus, additional infections with resistant M. tuberculosis strains should
be considered when tuberculosis therapy fails.
