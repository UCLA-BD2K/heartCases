Glioblastoma represents 15%-20% of all intracranial tumors and approximately 50% of gliomas in adults. Although capable of arising anywhere
in the central nervous system, these tumors mainly present as a frontotemporal lesion (63%) of the cerebral cortex. But, intraventricular
glioblastoma is rare and only few cases have been reported in the literature. We report a case of 40-year-old woman who had a headache,
vomiting and visual disturbances that persisted for four weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an intraventricular lesion with
inhomogeneous enhancement and infiltrative borders. These characteristics are consistent with other differential diagnoses: carcinomas,
ependymomas and choroid plexus papillomas. The patient underwent a stereotactic biopsy allowed the final diagnosis of intra ventricular
glioblastoma. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an intraventricular lesion with inhomogeneous enhancement and infiltrative borders
