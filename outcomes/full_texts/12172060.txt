Bacterial pericarditis has been recognized as a rare disease since the development of antibiotics. Usually, the disease is associated with
underlying conditions or a seeding of infection elsewhere to the pericardium. Here we describe a case of group G streptococcal pericarditis
as an initial presentation of colon cancer. A 52-yr-old man was admitted because of dyspnea. An electrocardiogram showed a diffuse ST-
segment elevation and a two-dimensional echocardiogram showed a large amount of pericardial effusion. A pericardiocentesis was done and
purulent fluid was drained. Group G streptococci was cultured in pericardial fluid. The patient was treated with antibiotics and
pericardiostomy with saline irrigation. A colonoscopy revealed a small mass with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in rectosigmoid
colon. He underwent a mucosectomy and was recovered without any complication.
