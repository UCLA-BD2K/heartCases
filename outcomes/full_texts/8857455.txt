uncommon tumour with distinctive clinical and histological features. Although the first case of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FI-
HCC) was described by Edmondson in 1956, and later confirmed in five patients by Peters, the majority of reports followed those of Berman et
al. and Craig et al. 1,2. A case of FI-HCC, which is rarely diagnosed in Mediterranean countries including Turkey, is presented in the
following report.
