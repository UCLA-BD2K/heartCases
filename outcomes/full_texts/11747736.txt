We describe the first case of community-acquired bacteremia caused by Acinetobacter radioresistens; the patient was a 32-year-old HIV-
positive neutropenic woman. Ambiguous Gram staining and poor biochemical reactivity of blood culture isolates misguided early diagnosis and
therapy. Bacterial identification was based on 16S rDNA sequence analysis. A. radioresistens can be considered as a cause of opportunistic
infection in immunodeficient patients.
