A successful attempt at percutaneous transluminanl coronary angioplasty (PTCA) to relieve stenosis of the mid-portion of the left anterior
descending artery was achieved in a 6-year 9-month old boy who had multiple coronary aneurysms and stenosis due to Kawasaki disease. Despite
the progression of coronary stenosis he had been well except for the perfusion defect of the anterior wall of myocardium on 99mTc-MIBI SPECT
with dipyridamole infusion until PTCA was carried out after 4-year 4-months of the onset of illness. The area of stenosis was 70% before
PTCA and 20% after PTCA. No restenosis at the site of PTCA was observed on follow-up angiography at 26 months after PTCA. This successful
attempt may indicate that this procedure should be considered early in subclinical stenosis to prevent ischemic cardiac damage.
