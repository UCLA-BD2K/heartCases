Central nervous system is often involved by herpes zoster but it is very rarely seen that contralateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia developed
after herpes zoster ophthalmicus. We report a case of herpes zoster ophthalmicus followed by the delayed contralateral hemiparesis. A
33-year-old man developed acute cerebral infarction and resultant right hemiparesis 44 days after herpes zoster ophthalmicus in the left
side. Brain CT disclosed hypodense area in the left basal ganglia. Cerebral angiography revealed segmental narrowing of M1 portion of the
right middle cerebral artery.
