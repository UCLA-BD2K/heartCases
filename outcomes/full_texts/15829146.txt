Dissecting aneurysm is the condition produced by separation of the layers of the arterial wall by circulating blood. Although rare, the
coexistence of aortic dissection and aberrant right subclavian artery may be catastrophic. In this study we report the endovascular
treatment of a patient with thoracic aorta dissection associated with aberrant right subclavian artery. Aortic clamping proximal to the left
subclavian artery in a patient with an aberrant right subclavian artery slows or eliminates flow to both vertebral arteries. Endovascular
repair eliminates the complications associated with aortic clamping during surgical repair in the presence of an aberrant right subclavian
artery; therefore, it should be considered the treatment of choice in this situation.
