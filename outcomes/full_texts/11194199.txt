We report a case of Aspergillus terreus discitis which developed in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia following induction
chemotherapy. A. terreus was isolated from sputum, one month earlier, but the physician did not consider it significant at the time.
Magnetic resonance imaging study showed the involvement of L3-4, L4-5 and L5-S1 intervertebral discs. Etiology was established by means of
histology and culturing a surgical specimen of disc materials. Our patient survived after a surgical debridement and amphotericin B
administration with a total dose of 2.0 g. Discitis caused by Aspergillus terreus is a very rare event. A. terreus is one of the invasive
Aspergillus species. The pathogenetic mechanism is discussed and the literature is reviewed.
