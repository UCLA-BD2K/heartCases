Disseminated coccidioidomycosis is a systemic fungal infection that is occurring more commonly and causes high mortality in patients with
compromised host defense or debilitated. It is endemic in certain areas of North, Central, and South America. Increasingly, cases are being
recognized outside the endemic area, due to travelers who have visited an endemic area. We experienced a case of disseminated
coccidioidomycosis, as a reactivation of infection acquired earlier in a patient, who was a former resident of an endemic area.
