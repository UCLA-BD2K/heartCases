Malignant transformation of mature cystic teratoma of the ovary can develop with an incidence of 1-2%. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most
common malignant tumor arising in benign cystic teratoma. The authors have recently experienced a case of combined microcystic adnexal
carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma arising in a benign cystic teratoma of the ovary in a 72-year-old Korean woman. The right ovarian
cystic mass had been ruptured and firmly adhered with salpinx and omental fat tissue on operation. Thickened cystic wall with yellowish
white solid infiltrative lesion was noted grossly, and two different malignant tumors of microcystic adnexal carcinoma exhibiting both
eccrine and hair follicular differentiation and squamous cell carcinoma were observed microscopically. PAS and CEA positivities suggested
eccrine differentiation in areas of microcystic adnexal carcinoma.
