Carbon monoxide, a gas originating from incomplete combustion of carbon-based fuels, is an important cause of human deaths. In this paper,
we describe an unusual carbon monoxide poisoning in a dwelling without obvious sources of combustion gases, for which two adults had to be
treated in a hyperbaric chamber. Carbon monoxide readings were taken in the house and in the neighboring homes. Methane gas and nitrogen
oxide levels were also monitored in the house air. Soil samples were collected around the house and tested for hydrocarbon residues. The
investigation revealed the presence of a pocket of carbon monoxide under the foundation of the house. The first readings revealed carbon
monoxide levels of 500 ppm in the basement. The contamination lasted for a week. The investigation indicated that the probable source of
contamination was the use of explosives at a nearby rain sewer construction site. The use of explosives in a residential area can constitute
a major source of carbon monoxide for the neighboring populations. This must be investigated, and public health authorities, primary-care
physicians, governmental authorities, and users and manufacturers of explosives must be made aware of this problem.
