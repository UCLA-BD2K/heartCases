An American physician-traveler to East Africa presented with manifestations of cerebral malaria and was treated with intravenous quinidine
for chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria. He later relapsed with Plasmodium ovale infection, despite previous primaquine therapy.
Treatment of chloroquine-resistant malaria is discussed. The difficulty in diagnosing P. ovale infections and the predominance of this
malaria species over P. vivax in East Africa are reviewed.
