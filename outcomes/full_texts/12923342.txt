Pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (PEH) is a rare tumor that occurs among young women and typically presents as bilateral multiple
nodules. In the present report, we describe an uncommon case of PEH presented as a single cavitary nodule in a 33-yr-old asymptomatic man.
This is the first case of PEH presented as a single cavitary nodule in the English literature. Three years of the follow-up without
treatment was performed. Overall histologic findings were accord with conventional PEH, but some atypical features such as, increased
mitotic activity (mean; two per ten high power fields), necrosis, spindling, and pleural and vascular invasion were recognized.
Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for CD34. This report may contribute to the data on clinical findings and natural
history of this rare tumor.
