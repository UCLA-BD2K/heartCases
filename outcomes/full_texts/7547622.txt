acalculous gall bladder with an anomalous pancreatico-biliary junction (PBJ) and a type IVa choledochal cyst. Cholecystectomy and Rouxen- Y
hepatico-jejunostomy (RHJ) was performed after division of the common bile duct (CBD) and excision of the dilated segment. The details of
the case are presented and the role of an abnormal PBJ in gall bladder carcinogenesis is discussed.
