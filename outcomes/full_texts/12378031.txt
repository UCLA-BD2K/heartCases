Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is an important means for postoperative analgesia with parenteral opioid. However, postoperative nausea
and vomiting (PONV) remains a major problem with a PCA system. Droperidol is used in PCA to prevent PONV. Extrapyramidal reactions by
droperidol are, however, occasionally induced. We describe two cases of severe extrapyramidal hypertonic syndrome with an intravenous
administration of droperidol in PCA in young patients, following orthopedic surgery.
