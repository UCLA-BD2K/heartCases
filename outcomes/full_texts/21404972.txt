Squamous papillomas are common lesions of the oral mucosa with a predilection for the mucosa of the hard and soft palate. As an oral lesion,
it raises concern because of its clinical appearance, which may mimic exophytic carcinoma, verrucous carcinoma or condyloma acuminatum. Its
pathogenesis is related to human papilloma virus but there is controversy regarding its viral origin. We present a case of squamous
papilloma presenting as oral lesion along with a review of the literature.
