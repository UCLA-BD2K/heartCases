This report presents a case of calcifying fibrous pseudotumor arising in the posterior mediastinum of a 54-year-old woman. The
histopathologic features of this case were identical to that of calcifying fibrous pseudotumor first designated in 1993. It is a distinctive
benign fibrous lesion characterized by the presence of characteristics psammomatous or dystrophic calcification, abundant hyalinized
collagen and lymphoplasmacytic cell infiltrate. Immunohistochemically most of the scattered fibroblasts were positive for vimentin, but not
for CD-34 and cytokeratins, distinguishing it from solitary fibrous tumor of pleura and desmoplastic mesothelioma. The unusual site of the
posterior mediastinum and the old age characterize this case.
