We report here a case of a patient affected by endometrial cancer and treated primarily with leuprolide, the surgical approach being
unfeasible due to her compromised conditions. The therapy was continued for more than 6 years, and no progression of the disease was
observed. During this period, some histological and immunohistochemical evaluations of the tumour (morphology, grading, proliferation and
apoptotic index, E-cadherin expression) were performed. Furthermore, the expression of m-RNA for luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone
(LHRH) receptors was determined. The results showed a discrepancy between some biological parameters of the tumour and its clinical
characteristics. In fact, despite features suggestive of a progression of the cancer (such as the increase of both tumour grading and
proliferating capacity (MIB-1), and a fall in the reparative process (appearance of mutated p53, reduced expression of both bcl-2 and
c-erb-2) being detected, neither local invasion nor metastatic lesions were clinically observed. This discrepancy might be due to the
maintenance of high levels of E-cadhezin. Moreover, since this tumour was shown to express mRNA for LHRH receptors, new evidence is provided
about the favourable impact of LHRH analogue treatment in patients affected by endometrial cancer. Â© 2001 Cancer Research Campaign
