who was a poor candidate for surgery because of severe liver cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus. Two attempts to occlude the HAA by
transcatheter embolization failed because of recanalization of the aneurysm. Moreover, aneurysmal dilatation of the superior mesenteric
artery and the left renal artery developed and progressed. Both the literature and the present case show that an individual approach to
treatment of extraorganic HAA should be chosen in dependantan location and anatomy of the lesion.
