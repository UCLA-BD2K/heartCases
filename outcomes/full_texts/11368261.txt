isolated from wound infections and abscesses. Bacteremia with group F streptococcus is uncommon, and the lower gynecologic tract has not
been reported as a source. We report a case of a Bartholin's abscess leading to group F streptococcal bacteremia. Case: A 31-year-old female
noted fever and rigors 30 min after manipulation of a 3-day-old vulvar abscess. An empty Bartholin's gland abscess was found on examination,
and blood cultures grew Î²-hemolytic group F streptococci. The patient was treated with ampicillin/sulbactam, symptoms improved, and follow-
up blood cultures revealed no growth. Conclusion: Group F streptococci are known to inhabit various body sites and have a predilection for
forming abscesses; however, bacteremia is infrequent. They have occasionally been identified in true infections of the genitourinary tract
but only very rarely in Bartholin's abscesses. This case of group F streptococcal bacteremia following self-drainage of a Bartholin's
abscess constitutes the first such description in the medical literature.
