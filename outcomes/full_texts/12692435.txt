Flumazenil, an imidazobenzodiazepine, is the first benzodiazepine antagonist and is being used to reverse the adverse pharmacological
effects of benzodiazepine. There have been a few reports on the central nevous system side effects with its use. We report a patient with
generalized ballism following administration of flumazenil. The mechanism through which flumazenil induced this symptom is unknown. It is
conceivable that flumazenil may antagonize the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex and induce dopamine hypersensitivity, thus induce
dyskinesic symptoms.
