Recurrent zoster myelitis is quite rare. We present a previously healthy 27-year-old woman who developed recurrent attacks of myelopathy
shortly after the characteristic skin rashes of herpes zoster. Magnetic resonance imaging studies demonstrated each lesion in the spinal
cord at the same segments as the skin lesions. She had two attacks at opposite sites at the same spinal cord level and complete recovery
after being treated with intravenous acyclovir. We suspect that direct invasion of varicella zoster virus was the cause of recurrent
myelopathy in our patient.
