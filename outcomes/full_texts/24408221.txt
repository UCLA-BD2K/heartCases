A 44-year-old woman was diagnosed with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Her mother has the same disease. Even after
hemodialysis was started in 2003 due to end-stage renal failure, abdominal distention progressed and a protruding umbilical hernia became
prominent (Fig. 1a, b). However, the surgeons hesitated to perform hernia repair. Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) was performed to
treat massive hepatomegaly in 2005 and to treat bilateral nephromegaly in 2006 . Her abdominal distension and umbilical hernia both improved
in 2013 (Fig. 2a, b). This case emphasizes that massive polycystic liver and kidneys may contribute to umbilical hernia formation by
increasing the intra-abdominal pressure.Fig. 1 a Gross appearance of pre-TAE. b Gross appearance of post-TAE. Arrow shows protruded
