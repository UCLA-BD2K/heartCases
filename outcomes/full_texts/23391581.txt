A 75-year-old patient was admitted for worsening of dyspnoea 10 months after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (26 mm CoreValve,
Medtronicâ„¢). Echocardiography demonstrated an excellent function of the prosthetic valve. Since the patient's previous history included a
coronary artery bypass surgery too, a diagnostic coronary angiography was performed to rule out graft failure. While approximating the ostia
of the venous bypasses, the diagnostic catheter flapped through the integrity of the aortic wall. Contrast media was given carefully (Panel
A, white arrows and Supplementary material online) revealing a para-aortic cavum. Computed tomography (Panel B) and
transesophagealechocardiography (Panel C) confirmed the diagnosis of a false aneurysm. Despite the high surgical risk, surgery was
considered mandatory. The intra-operative situs is shown in Panel D demonstrating the ostium of the left coronary artery (white arrow) and
the ostium of the pseudoaneurysm (two black arrows). The regular position of the stent graft is shown in Panel A as well as the ostium of
the false aneurysm (one red arrow). Surgical replacement of the CoreValve prosthesis by a mechanical valve and a Gore-Tex conduit was
performed. This is the first report of a false aneurysm of the ascending aorta most likely due to the friction of the commissures of the
outflow part of the valve stent. Pre-procedural CABG had prevented overt rupture and, this way, had saved the patient's life. Supplementary
material is available at European Heart Journal online.
