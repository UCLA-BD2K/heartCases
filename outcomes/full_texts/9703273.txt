The paradigm that human malignancies are monoclonal has been questioned during recent years by the finding of unrelated, cytogenetically
aberrant clones in short-term cultures from certain tumour types, notably carcinomas of the breast, skin and upper aerodigestive tract. In
order to analyse whether cytogenetically unrelated clones are also unrelated at the molecular level, we analysed the X-chromosome
inactivation status in cell cultures from a cytogenetically highly polyclonal acinic cell carcinoma of the parotid gland. By using cell
cultures dominated by a single abnormal clone, obtained through in vitro culturing for 3-5 passages, we showed that the different clones
must indeed have originated from different cells.
