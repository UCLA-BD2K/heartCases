Lymphocytes from a patient who had an unusually long survival after therapy for a human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus (HTLV)-associated T
cell lymphoma were stimulated in vitro with an autologous tumor cell line, and the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) was studied.
CTL generated were directed against autologous (HTLV-associated tumor cells. These propagated CTL were OKT3+, OKT4-, and OKT8+. The
cytotoxic activity required target tumor cells that were infected with HTLV and also expressed histocompatibility antigens in common with
the patient, suggesting a major histocompatibility complex-restricted associative recognition of target antigens expressed on the tumor cell
membrane.
