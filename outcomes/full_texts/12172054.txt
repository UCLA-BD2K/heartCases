Malignant lymphoma can involve the cardiac cavity or myocardium as a mass. Clinical symptoms of its cardiac involvement are usually absent
or nonspecific, making the diagnosis of the cardiac involvement very difficult before death. We experienced a patient with secondary
myocardial non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) as a primary clinical problem. A 39-yr-old woman
visited our hospital because of dyspnea and palpitation for 7 days. Physical examination revealed rapid heart beat with variable intensity
of the first heart sound and soft mass in the lower abdomen. VT with a cycle length of 480 msec was recorded in resting 12-lead
electrocardiogram. Two well-circumscribed hypo-echogenic round masses were demonstrated in the interventricular septum and left ventricular
posterior wall. Cytological examination of aspirated pericardial fluid and percutaneous needle biopsy of the abdominal mass revealed a
diffuse large cell type non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Myocardial masses and ventricular tachycardia resolved with chemotherapy using
cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone regimen. To our best knowledge, the same case as ours has not been reported
previously.
