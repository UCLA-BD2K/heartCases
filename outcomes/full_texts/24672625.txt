Warts are tumor due to the infection with human papilloma virus HPV. We report the case of a giant wart evolving in the back of a thirty-
three year-old man, This had been present since he had 7 years-old, but had been growing rapidly for the two last years. His medical history
was devoid of recurrent infections, tumor pathologies. The exam revealed a brown tumor on the right paravertebral region that measured
25cm/7cm. It had irregular borders but well delineated. The surrounding skin was unaffected. Examination of the lymph nodes revealed
multiple bilateral adenopathies exceeding 2cm in diameter. The rest of the physical examination revealed no additional abnormalities. A
biopsy revealed papillomatosis, hyperkeratosis with parakeratosis, and the presence of koilocytes. The diagnosis was a giant wart confirmed
by PCR. Neoplastic pathology was put forward as a second option due to the large size of the lesion, the speed of development, the
peripheral adenopathies, as well as impaired overall health. These symptoms prompted the surgical excision of the tumor for a histological
analysis on multiple slices of the specimen; no neoplastic proliferation was found. The uniqueness of our observation lies in the size,
location, and length of evolution, as well as the unexplained increase in activity in the two years prior to examination. He reported having
been employed as a mason during these years and frequently worked topless in the open air carrying heavy sachets on his back. These
conditions could explain the warts increased activity related to autoinoculation. longitudinal verrucous tumor measuring 25cm x 7cm.
