We present a case of a 33 years old man who presented to the Emergency Department of our Hospital with small, red, drop-like lesions located
at his arms, legs, torso and back. He had no history of any dermatological disease, but he had a positive maternal family history for plaque
psoriasis. The patient had recently recovered from acute tonsillitis after receiving amoxicillin - clavulanic acid therapy. The diagnosis of
guttate psoriasis was clinically established, based on the typical presentation and the history of recent upper respiratory infection. He
was treated with a combination of oral and topical corticosteroids and he was advised to have frequent follow-up visits to our Dermatology
Department. Guttate psoriasis (also known as “Eruptive psoriasis”) is more common in young adults and often follows a bacterial or viral
infection, but it has also been associated with drugs, stress, skin injury and other trigger factors. Small, red, drop-like lesions of
Guttate psoriasis located at the hand (A) and the arm (B) of the patient
