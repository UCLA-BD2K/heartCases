We present dincopathologic features of three cases of biopsy-proven pancreas allograft dysfunction in Korea. All patients had advanced
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Case 1 was a 30-year-old woman who underwent a simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation.
Urinary infection developed 6 days after the operation, which remitted and reappeared, when urine amylase level was normal. Since the 55th
day after the operation, intermittent hematuria has persisted. Cytomegalovirus inclusions were detected on the urinary bladder and grafted
duodenal mucosa. The graft was removed due to perforation of the grafted duodenum and panperitonitis. Case 2 was a 27-year-old man
undergoing pancreas transplantation alone (PTA). Ten days after the transplatation, the level of 24 urine amylase decreased and the graft
was not delineated by 99mTc DTPA scintigraphy. Allograft needle biopsy revealed multiple acinar cell necrosis and mild lymphocytic
infiltration which were compatible with mild acute rejection. Case 3 was a 25-year-old man undergoing cadevaric PTA. Three months after the
transplantation, graft was removed due to gastric perforation associated with cytomegalovirus and angiodestructive fungal infection. Various
causes of pancreas allograft dysfunction can be diagnosed by needle biopsy, thus appropriate biopsy specimen should be taken using improved
biopsy technique.
