This paper presents a conceptual approach for leading various types of groups of chronically mentally ill patients. Although these groups
may have a concrete, task-oriented purpose, with skillful leadership they also function as psychotherapy groups. The developmental deficits
in ego functions, object relations, and social skills that severely impair such groups can be compensated by non-interpretative actions of
the therapists. The group leader must actively work to provide for the structure, stability, and safety of the group when group members are
unable to provide these for themselves.
