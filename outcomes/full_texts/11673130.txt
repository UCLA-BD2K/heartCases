A previously healthy woman developed hypersensitivity pneumonitis of such severity that she required chronic systemic corticosteroid therapy
for symptom control. Detailed investigation of her workplace and home environments revealed fungi in her typical suburban home, to which she
had specific serum precipitating antibodies. Efforts to remove mold from the home were unsuccessful in relieving symptoms, and moving to
another residence was the only intervention that allowed her to be withdrawn from corticosteroid therapy. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is
commonly associated with occupational or avocational exposures, such as moldy hay in farmers or bird antigen in bird breeders. We propose
that hypersensitivity pneumonitis may occur in North America, as it does in Japan, from domestic exposures alone.
