In the present study we describe the cases of two patients with cluster-like headache related to intracranial carotid artery aneurysm. One
of these patients responded to verapamil prescription with headache resolution. In both cases the surgical clipping of the aneurysm resolved
the cluster pain. These findings strongly suggest a pathophysiological link between the two conditions. The authors discuss the potential
pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cluster-like headache due to intracranial carotid artery aneurysm.
