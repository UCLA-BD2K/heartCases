The application of low-voltage direct electrical current (DEC) has been studied in animals and humans for the ablation of anal condylomata,
oesophageal cancer and Kaposi's sarcoma. Twenty milliamps of DEC passed through multiple 6 cm x 1 cm, flat-plate longitudinal electrodes
into the squamous mucosa of the oesophagus of healthy dogs for periods ranging from 10 min to 2 h resulted in denudation and necrosis of the
oesophageal mucosa at the site of application of the current. In humans, the application of DEC to two patients with benign anal condyloma
acuminata, three patients with inoperable obstructing oesophageal cancer and one patient with disseminated Kaposi sarcoma resulted in
striking necrosis of tumour tissue that was confirmed by macroscopic and microscopic studies. These initial findings imply promising
therapeutic potential for the use of DEC as a simple, effective, safe, low-cost alternative for ablation of neoplasia.
