The recently described species Candida dubliniensis has been recovered primarily from superficial oral candidiasis in HIV-infected patients.
No clinically documented invasive infections were reported until now in this patient group or in other immunocompromised patients. We report
three cases of candidemia due to this newly emerging Candida species in HIV-negative patients with chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression
and bone marrow transplantation.
