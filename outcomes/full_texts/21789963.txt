This article provides an overview of metastases to jaws (MJ), mainly concerning the differences between American and Chinese patients, and
exploring the relationship between the primary tumors' prevalence (PTP) and constituent ratio of MJ. Information concerning of 399 MJ cases
in 215 papers, including one new case in our hospital, was subjected to statistic analysis. The main clinical features of MJ, such as
constituent ratio of PTP and that of MJ, metastatic sites, treatments, and prognosis were summarized. Breast, lung, kidney, prostate and
thyroid (in descending order) were the leading primary sites of MJ. Furthermore, the constituent ratio of MJ was found to be correlated with
that of PTP in all subjects including American and Chinese subjects in our study. As to metastatic sites in the mandible, a specific “M”
shaped pattern appeared regardless of the tumor type or constituent ratios of MJ were in all subjects. Almost all subjects received
traditionally palliative treatments, and the prognosis was quite poor. The PTP had a significant impact on the constituent ratio of MJ.
However, it was the properties of the microenvironment rather than characteristics or constituent ratios of tumor cells, that decided the
metastatic sites in various tumor subjects.
