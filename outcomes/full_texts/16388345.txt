The case of a 26–year–old woman suffering from cervical trauma with disc herniation presenting with arm and neck pain is presented. She
underwent cervical discectomy with fusion because the pain did not improve with medical therapies; as the neck pain resumed after surgery, a
cervical cord neurostimulator was implanted, with improvement for cervicogenic headache. This report underlines the presence of two
pathologies and the relationship between C2 and trigeminal pathways.
