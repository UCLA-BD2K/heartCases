Methotrexate (MTX) is a folate antagonist widely used both as an anticancer drug and as an immunosupressant. Administration of an 8-day
methotrexate and folinic acid regime may be associated with pleuritic chest pain and pneumonitis. We have reviewed the toxicity seen in 168
consecutive patients treated with low-dose MTX for persistent trophoblastic disease. Twenty-five per cent of patients developed serosal
symptoms, pleurisy was the commonest complaint. The majority of patients had mild to moderate symptoms which were controlled with simple
analgesia and did not necessitate a change in treatment; 11.9% had severe symptoms which necessitated a change in treatment. One patient
developed a pericardial effusion and a second patient developed severe reversible peritoneal irritation. The possible aetiology and
pathophysiology of methotrexate-induced serosal toxicity is discussed. Â© 1999 Cancer Research Campaign
