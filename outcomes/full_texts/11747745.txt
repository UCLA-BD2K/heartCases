A new Rabies virus variant, with no close antigenic or genetic relationship to any known rabies variants found in bats or terrestrial
mammals in the Americas, was identified in association with human rabies cases reported from the state of Cear√°, Brazil, from 1991 to 1998.
The marmoset, Callithrix jacchus acchus, was determined to be the source of exposure.
