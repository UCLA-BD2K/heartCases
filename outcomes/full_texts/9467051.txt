Quantification of the biologically relevant dose is required to establish cause and effect between radiation detriment or burden and
important biological outcomes. Most epidemiologic studies of unanticipated radiation exposure fail to establish cause and effect because
researchers have not been able to construct a valid quantification of dose for the exposed population. However, no one biodosimetric
technique (biophysical or biological) meets all the requirements of an ideal dosimeter. This paper reviews how the collection of
biodosimetric data for victims of radiation accidents can be used to create a dosimetric "gold standard." Particular emphasis is placed on
the use of electron spin resonance, a standard for radiation accident dosimetry. As an example of this technique, a review will be presented
of a previously reported study of an individual exposed to a 60Co sterilization source.
