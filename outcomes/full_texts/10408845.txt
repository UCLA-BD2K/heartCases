Sarcoma botryoides of the cervix is an extremely rare tumour and seems to be associated with a better prognosis than its vaginal
counterpart. Recent studies have suggested that it is possible to limit surgery to local excision in stage I cases. We report three cases of
young subjects treated successfully with polypectomy or diathermy loop excision followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. One patient had a local
recurrence which was treated with further local excision. All subjects remain alive without evidence of recurrence and with normal menstrual
function 36, 38 and 38 months following initial diagnosis. A conservative surgical approach to early cervical sarcoma botryoides is
possible. The efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy and the regimen of choice still need to be investigated. Â© 1999 Cancer Research Campaign
