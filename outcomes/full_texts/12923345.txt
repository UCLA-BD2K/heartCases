Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) is a rare primary neoplasm that constitutes less than 1% of the malignant tumors of bone, and
involvement of the skull is very rare. We present a case of malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the skull, presenting an intraosseous lesion
in a 43-yr-old woman. She had a rapidly growing, tender mass in the right parietal region. A plain radiograph showed an osteolytic lesion of
the right parietal bone. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the lesion showed heterogeneous low signal intensity on T1-weighted images
and slightly high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. No evidence of an extraosseous extension to the adjacent dura and soft tissue was
found, and a wide excision of the parietal bone was performed. Histologically, the tumor was a typical MFH displaying pleomorphic spindle
cells in a storiform pattern. The results of immunohistochemical stainings revealed that the tumor cells were positive for vimentin,
alpha-1-antitrypsin, and p53, and negative for smooth muscle actin, S100 protein, desmin, and MyoD1. Three months later, a mainly cystic,
recurrent mass was developed at the previously operated site. Before the resection, we first performed the percutaneous aspiration cytology,
revealing diagnostic multinucleated pleomorphic cells. Thereafter, she had to receive repetitive resections of recurrent or residual
lesions, and she died of postoperative meningoencephalitis two years after the first operation.
