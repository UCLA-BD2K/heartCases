A 75-year-old woman with recurrent bladder cancer was transferred to our department for palliative treatment. Plain radiographies of the
chest and kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) [Figure 1a and b] showed lots of linear foreign materials that appeared to be uniform in size, shape,
and density. A computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated multiple fine linear metallic subcutaneous densities along
the anterior and posterior [Figure 1c] abdominal walls, which were compatible with the findings on the KUB. Further history taking revealed
that the patient had received acupuncture therapy with gold thread for more than 10 years in the course of chronic musculoskeletal pain
treatment. The linear densities correspond to implanted gold threads at the acupuncture points. Acupuncture, one of the most popular
modalities in complementary and alternative medicine, is often used for pain treatment. Practitioners insert small pieces of sterile gold
thread into the painful areas of the body in the course of acupuncture therapy. These short gold-needle fragments are left permanently in
the subcutaneous tissues of the patients and may work as continuous acupuncture stimulation. The gold threads could be visible on and
complicate imaging studies such as plain radiographs, CTs, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs), as seen in our patient. Lots of linear
metallic densities on radiographs. (a and b) Plain radiograph of chest and KUB shows numerous linear radiodense threads. (c) Computed
tomography of the abdomen and pelvis shows multiple linear metallic subcutaneous densities along the posterior abdominal wall (coronal)
