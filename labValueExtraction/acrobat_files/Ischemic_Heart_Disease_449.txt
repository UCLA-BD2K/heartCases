Coronary angiography showed no obstructive coronary artery disease, with only a 30% stenosis in his circumflex coronary artery. Initial views showed diffuse vasospasm of both the right and left coronary arteries, which resolved with administration of intracoronary nitroglycerin . Tests for serum creatine kinase and troponin T had negative results. His lipid panel results were notable for total cholesterol of 127 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 67 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). Interrogation of the ICD revealed 4 episodes of ventricular fibrillation with appropriate treatment , each preceded by chest pain. He received a diagnosis of coronary vasospasm leading to ventricular fibrillation and was treated with a statin, antiplatelet therapy, long-acting nitrate, and amlodipine besylate (dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers). He continued to have recurrent episodes of chest pain and ST-segment elevation while receiving amlodipine, so he was switched to verapamil hydrochloride (phenylalkylamine class of calcium channel blockers), after which he had no recurrence of chest pain or ST-segment elevation on ECG. He was exhorted to cease tobacco and alcohol use and discharged home.Discussion
