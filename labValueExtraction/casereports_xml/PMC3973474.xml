      <abstract>
        <p>The objective of this study was to describe the process of intensive speech therapy
for a 6-year-old child using compensatory articulations while presenting with
velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) and a history of cleft lip and palate. The
correction of VPI was temporarily done with a pharyngeal obturator since the child
presented with very little movement of the pharyngeal walls during speech,
compromising the outcome of a possible pharyngeal flap procedure (pharyngoplasty).
The program of intensive speech therapy involved 3 phases, each for duration of 2
weeks incorporating 2 daily sessions of 50 minutes of therapy. A total of 60 sessions
of intervention were done with the initial goal of eliminating the use of
compensatory articulations. Evaluation before the program indicated the use of
co-productions (coarticulations) of voiceless plosive and fricative sounds with
glottal stops (simultaneous production of 2 places of productions), along with weak
intraoral pressure and hypernasality, all compromising speech intelligibility. To
address place of articulation, strategies to increase intraoral air pressure were
used along with visual, auditory and tactile feedback, emphasizing the therapy target
and the air pressure and airflow during plosive and fricative sound productions.
After the first two phases of the program, oral place of articulation of the targets
were achieved consistently. During the third phase, velopharyngeal closure during
speech was systematically addressed using a bulb reduction program with the objective
of achieving velopharyngeal closure during speech consistently. After the intensive
speech therapy program involving the use of a pharyngeal obturator, we observed
absence of hypernasality and compensatory articulation with improved speech
intelligibility.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Among the areas of Dentistry, Odontopediatrics, Orthodontics and Maxillofacial
prosthesis are closely related with speech pathology. The prosthodontist and his
partner, the prosthetic technician, are involved with the speech pathologist,
particularly during treatment of oncologic and neurologic cases, as well as during
management of craniofacial anomalies like cleft palate. </p>
      <p>Cleft lip and palate (CLP) is a common congenital anomaly, occurring at a rate of 1:650
live births in Brazil<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.
Rehabilitation of CLP in this country usually starts with primary surgeries to correct
the cleft lip (cheiloplasty) and cleft palate (palatoplasty), performed most often
during the first months and first year of life, respectively<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. After the anatomic correction of the cleft, we may find
inadequacies, such as the velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD), a condition associated with
communication and feeding disorders.</p>
      <p>VPD is characterized by inadequate velopharyngeal functioning resulting in unwanted
communication between oral and nasal cavities during production of oral speech sounds
and during sucking and deglutition, also affecting middle ear function. Particularly in
relation to speech, signs of VPD can include hypernasality, nasal air escape, weak
intraoral air pressure during oral sound production, and use of atypical place of
production (Compensatory Articulation - CA)<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. </p>
      <p>When VPD is related to an insufficiency of tissue (for example, an absence of musculus
uvulae or a short or hypoplastic palate) or to an increase in nasopharyngeal space (for
example, a deep nasopharynx), a condition known as velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI),
the treatment requires a physical procedure (surgical or prosthetic) to establish a
physical structure which allows for adequate velopharyngeal functioning. VPD can also be
the result of velopharyngeal incompetency. In this case the physical/anatomical
structure is sufficient to allow for adequate functioning, however, the functioning does
not occur. Incompetency can be the result of neuro-sensory-motor alterations (paralysis
or paresis) or even the result of incorrect learning of velopharyngeal functioning for
speech production. Finally, VPD can be caused by an insufficiency combined with an
incompetency. </p>
      <p>Treatment of insufficiency may involve a secondary surgical procedure or a pharyngeal
obturator. The obturator is made by the dentist in partnership with the speech
pathologist and consists of a removable device with an anterior portion (acrylic plate
with clips for retention), an intermediate portion (connecting the anterior portion to
the bulb) and a pharyngeal bulb (the portion shaped to occupy the velopharyngeal
gap)<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. </p>
      <p>When functional, the bulb favors the correction of VPI related obligatory speech errors.
Sometimes physical correction alone is not enough and speech therapy is needed to
establishing adequate velopharyngeal functioning during speech production. The
combination of behavioral and prosthetic treatment allows for simultaneous correction of
the insufficiency and incompetency resulting from mislearning. It is also an excellent
alternative to optimize a future surgical correction of the insufficiency<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. That is, once velopharyngeal sufficiency
is established with the pharyngeal bulb, the speech pathologist can use behavioral
strategies along with bulb reduction to modify the pattern of functioning of the
velopharynx improving excursion of velum and pharyngeal walls affecting surgical
recomendation. This intervention requires inter and even transdisciplinary work between
areas of dentistry and speech pathology. It may be the only alternative available to
patients who have a poor prognosis for surgical correction of insufficiency due to the
presence of incompetency resulting from learned velopharyngeal inadequacy, such as
hypodynamic velopharynx.</p>

      <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
      <p>The objective this study was to describe the process of intensive speech therapy for a 6
year old child using compensatory articulations while presenting with velopharyngeal
insufficiency (VPI) and a history of cleft lip and palate.</p>
    </sec>

      <title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title>
      <sec>
        <title>Participant</title>
        <p>The subject for the speech program was a girl with a history of unilateral cleft lip
and palate who presented classic signs of VPI after primary palatal surgery. The girl
started treatment at a craniofacial center receiving a primary lip procedure at 6
months of age with Spina technique and a primary palatal procedure at 9 months of age
with Von Langenback technique. Due to a wide cleft and lack of tissue to completely
close the cleft without tension, a secondary correction was performed to repair a
palatal fistula when the child was 2 years and 3 months old.</p>
        <p>During the evaluation performed before the speech therapy the child presented with
hypernasal speech and used compensatory articulations which compromised speech
intelligibility. She was referred for speech therapy in her hometown, but no change
was observed in her speech with the local interventions. At 6 years of age, a
nasoendoscopic examination confirmed presence of VPI and learned incompetency,
revealing a large gap associated with limited movement of pharyngeal walls and
limited velar elevation characterizing a condition known as hypodynamic
velopharynx<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. With a bad
prognosis for surgical correction of the insufficiency, the combined behavioral and
prosthetic treatment was recommended for this case.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Assessment procedures</title>
        <p>Before adapting the pharyngeal obturator, experienced speech pathologists performed
an auditory-perceptual evaluation, nasometric assessment, along with nasoendoscopic
and videofluorosocopic assessment of velopharyngeal function during speech. They also
used aerodynamic assessment (PERCI) to estimate the velopharyngeal area during
production of /p/. All assessments were repeated after the 60 sessions of speech
therapy and adaptation of the pharyngeal obturator. </p>
        <p>The auditory perceptual assessment of speech was conducted during conversational
speech for identification of presence or absence of hypernasality. Articulation was
evaluated during repetition of words and phrases, with the speech pathologist
identifying presence or absence of the use of compensatory articulation and
phonological errors not expected for the child's age. Using nasometric assessment, a
speech pathologist calculated the nasalance score to quantify the relative amount of
nasal acoustic energy during oral speech production. A maximum nasalance score of 27%
was expected during production of oral speech samples in Brazilian Portuguese
language. Values above 27% were interpreted as indicative of hypernasality<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p>The pressure-flow technique (modified rhinomanometry) was performed, as recommended
by Warren and Dubois<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (1964) using
a PERCI-SARS computerized system. The minimum cross-sectional area of the velopharynx
(velopharyngeal area) was determined during the production of the plosive /p/ in the
Portuguese word "papa." Areas of 0 to 4.9 mm<sup>2</sup> were interpreted as
representative of adequate velopharyngeal closure, areas of 5 to 9.9 mm<sup>2</sup>
were interpreted as representative of borderline but adequate velopharyngeal closure,
and areas of 10 to 19.9 mm<sup>2</sup> were interpreted as representative of
borderline and inadequate velopharyngeal closure, and areas of 20 mm<sup>2</sup> or
more were interpreted as representative of inadequate velopharyngeal closure,
according to the classification described by Warren<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> (1997).</p>
        <p>Nasoendoscopic and videofluoroscopic evaluations were performed for visualization of
the velopharyngeal structures during speech production, allowing for verification of
the ability of the velum to elevate and ability of the pharyngeal wall to move
towards midline of the velopharynx. During both exams, the presence, pattern and size
of the velopharyngeal gap were observed. </p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Prosthetic treatment of VPI</title>
        <p>Once favorable dental conditions to support a speech obturator were observed, a
palatal prosthesis was constructed by a dentist following 3 phases, each
corresponding to one visit to the rehabilitation center. Phase one involved the
development of the anterior portion of the device involving an acrylic plate with
retention clips. The intermediate portion was added followed by. A speech bulb
(pharyngeal obturator) that was shaped by a dentist along with the speech pathologist
during production of oral sounds that favor adequate velopharyngeal functioning. The
bulb was molded in thermoplastic material and later acrylized and polished,
respecting the gap shape and size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figures 1</xref>
and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">2</xref>).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>The three phases for development of the prosthesis took approximately 6 months,
involving 3 visits of 4 days each to the center. Each visit was to construct the 3
portions of the device, with 2 months intervals between visits. The interval between
each phase was needed to allow for the patient's adaptation to the device, which
initially caused gagging and discomfort. Once the pharyngeal obturator was completed
and the patient used the obturator daily and consistently, the speech therapy was
initiated.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Behavioral treatment of VPD</title>
        <p>An intensive speech therapy program was conducted at the craniofacial center,
consisting of 3 phases with duration of 2 weeks each, involving speech therapy twice
daily. Sessions lasted 50 minutes and initially targeted the elimination of
compensatory articulations. </p>
        <p>The first two phases targeted adequate production of oral place of articulation of
high pressure speech sounds. Strategies involved manipulation of oral and nasal air
pressure and airflow while establishing adequate place and manner of speech sounds as
proposed by Golding-Kushner<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> (2001)
and Bzoch<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>(2004). Visual, auditory
and tactile feedback was used to contrast the target to the inadequate productions.
The target was initially established in isolation followed by syllable production.
Once the target sound was consistently produced adequately in syllables, words
combining the target sound to liquid and nasal phonemes were introduced. </p>
        <p>More than one target was introduced in the same word or phrase only after all targets
were consistently produced with correct place of production. Later phrases were
introduced and complexity was increased until targets were adequately produced during
conversational speech.</p>
        <p>The program involved orientations and training of the family and the child to monitor
and to contrast adequate (target) and inadequate (CA) productions. With this program,
all sounds trained during therapy (the new speech) were also practiced daily at home
and monitored by the family between each phase of the program. The intervals between
phases were needed, since the child could only come to the center during school
vacation for periods no longer than 2 weeks each and because no speech pathologist
was found in the child's hometown who could continue the work established during
intensive therapy. </p>
        <p>After the first 2 phases of work, we verified consistent use of oral place of
production for all targets. Therefore, the third phase was initiated addressing
velopharyngeal (VP) functioning. Perception of oral and nasal air pressure and
airflow were addressed using auditory, visual and tactile feedback involving a
plastic tube for auditory enhancement of oral and nasal air flow and "see-escape" and
nasometry for visual enhancement of oral and nasal air flow. Once velopharyngeal
closure was systematically obtained during oral samples, the contrast of oral and
nasal was introduced addressing the ability to alternate between VP closure and VP
opening. Once consistent adequate velopharyngeal functioning was established with the
use of the pharyngeal obturator, a program for bulb reduction was initiated.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Speech bulb reduction program</title>
        <p>This phase involved a partnership between the dentist and the speech pathologist. The
prosthesis of the patient was replicated and the dentist was asked to shave off about
1 mm of acrylic around the surface creating a second bulb slightly smaller than the
original. The removal of the acrylic was done using a bur and followed with finishing
and final polishing. Once the device with the reduced bulb size was finished, speech
therapy resumed, contrasting oral production with the original device to that with
the smaller bulb. Feedback of oral and nasal air pressure and airflow were provided.
Once productions were similar with both bulbs, the dentist was asked again to remove
the acrylic of the larger bulb until it was about 1 mm smaller than the reduced bulb. </p>
        <p>The reductions were repeated until the maximum displacement of velopharyngeal
structures was established and verified by the lack of ability of the child to avoid
nasal air leak. About 6 mm of acrylic was removed from the bulb surface once the
reduction program was finished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figures 3</xref>,

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The role of the primary surgeries in cases of CLP is to correct the cleft without
compromising facial growth while establishing an adequate structure to support oral
functions like feeding and speech. Literature indicates that between 5% and 50% of the
cases who receive primary palatoplasty to correct cleft palate (average of 20%) still
present VPD after primary repair due to insufficiency, incompetency or both. Correction
of VPD can involve a physical (surgery or prosthesis) and/or behavioral
treatment<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. In some cases the management of VPD with speech therapy
alone (in cases of incompetency) or with secondary surgery (in cases of insufficiency)
do not have good prognosis requiring the use of prosthetic management. The child studied
was referred for a treatment program which allowed for the simultaneous management of
the insufficiency and incompetency involving behavioral manipulation of the
velopharyngeal mechanism. </p>
      <p>According to Pinto, Dalben and Pegoraro-Krook<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>(2007), prosthetic treatment of VPI involves the use of pharyngeal
obturators (speech bulbs) and the outcome of this approach depends on the degree of
hypernasality, type of compensatory articulation used, age and dental conditions of the
candidate, along with structural and functional conditions of the palate and pharyngeal
walls. The patient described in this case report fitted the criteria for recommendation
of the combined prosthetic and behavioral treatment. In this case, the use of a surgical
procedure for velar lengthening would not resolve the insufficiency since the VP gap was
too large. The results of a pharyngeal flap procedure was obscure due to limited
movement of pharyngeal walls. The use of a pharyngeal obturator combined with a speech
therapy program was recommended to rehabilitate this patient's speech and to optimize a
later surgical treatment to correct the insufficiency. </p>
      <p>This case report shows evidence that a pharyngeal obturator can be used as a temporary,
conservative, and easily reversible treatment of VPD postponing and optimizing future
surgical treatment. The device can be easily individualized according to the anatomical
and functional needs of the patient. The functional adaptation of a pharyngeal
obturator, however, requires teamwork between the dentist and the speech pathologist as
well as the family and the patient.</p>
      <p>If, on one hand, there are many advantages for the use of a pharyngeal obturator, on the
other hand there are also disadvantages, all of which need to be considered before
recommending the procedure. The treatment itself is usually planned in 3 phases, each
requiring one visit to the craniofacial center one, for the construction of each portion
of the palatal prosthesis. The number of visits, however, can increase when there are
difficulties with the adaptation of the device. Acceptance and understanding by the
family and patient of the type of treatment and the burden it entails are essential for
its success. The device will occupy the velopharyngeal space (the gap area), leading to
discomfort and gagging at the beginning<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Different than a surgery, for which the patient is anesthetized,
with the palatal prosthesis the patient must be compliant during all phases of the
treatment, particularly during functional adaptation and shaping of the speech bulb
which requires speech production. In the present case both the patient and the family
were compliant to the treatment prescribed. Furthermore the therapy addressing the use
of adequate place of sound production involved daily practice at home, requiring the
compliance and commitment of the child and her family. Orientation and training of the
family to monitor the exercises at home were needed for teaching discrimination between
the old and the new speech. </p>
      <p>The bulb reduction program, in particular, is described in the literature as an
alternative to elicit or increase movement of the pharyngeal walls, allowing for a
reduction of the VP gap, thus optimizing a future surgical correction of a
velopharyngeal insufficiency and fostering the use of a surgical procedure which entails
a lower risk of leading to respiratory obstruction<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. For some patients,
like the one in this case report, the presence of learning errors regarding
velopharyngeal functioning can lead to unsuccessful surgical results independent of the
surgical procedure used, particularly due to velopharyngeal hypodynamism. In such cases
the behavioral therapy combined with prosthetic treatment is an excellent alternative to
establish adequate velopharyngeal function for speech.</p>

        <title>Final Consideration</title>
        <p>Patients with speech disorders associated to VPD can be successfully treated with
behavioral speech therapy combined with a prosthetic approach guided to improve
speech intelligibility and to optimize future surgical correction of VP
insufficiency.</p>
