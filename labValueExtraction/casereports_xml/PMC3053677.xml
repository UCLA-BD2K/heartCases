      <abstract>
        <p>A report of a 67-year-old man, who had been suffering from an enterocutaneous fistula after a left hemicolectomy due to colon cancer is presented. He had sudden intermittent upper abdominal pain and a high amylase level in the drainage fluid. The fistulogram showed a colocutaneous fistula with an abnormal cavity in the left upper quadrant. ERCP was performed to demonstrate the relationship between the pancreatic duct and the colocutaneous fistula connected with the abnormal cavity, and showed a pancreatico-colo fistula which was connected with the abnormal cavity. From the results of the above two studies, a diagnosis of the pancreatico-colocutaneous fistula could be drained, and a distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy and closing of the colonic opening were performed. After the operation, the patient was discharged without problem. We report herein a case of pancreaticocolocutaneous fistula which was confirmed by ERCP preoperatively and surgically treated successfully.</p>
