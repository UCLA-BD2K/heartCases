        <p>Hyperparathyroidism Jaw-Tumour Syndrome (HPT-JT) is characterized by primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), maxillary/mandible ossifying fibromas and by parathyroid carcinoma in 15% of cases. Inactivating mutations of the tumour suppressor <italic>CDC73/HRPT2</italic> gene have been found in HPT-JT patients and also as genetic determinants of sporadic parathyroid carcinoma/atypical adenomas and, rarely, typical adenomas, in familial PHPT. Here we report the genetic and molecular analysis of the <italic>CDC73/HRPT2</italic> gene in three patients affected by PHPT due to atypical and typical parathyroid adenomas, in one case belonging to familial PHPT. Flag-tagged WT and mutant <italic>CDC73/HRPT2</italic> proteins were transiently transfected in HEK293 cells and functional assays were performed in order to investigate the effect of the variants on the whole protein expression, nuclear localization and cell overgrowth induction. We identified four <italic>CDC73/HRPT2</italic> gene mutations, three germline (c.679_680delAG, p.Val85_Val86del and p.Glu81_Pro84del), one somatic (p.Arg77Pro). In three cases the mutation was located within the Nucleolar Localisation Signals (NoLS). The three NoLS variants led to instability either of the corresponding mutated protein or mRNA or both. When transfected in HEK293 cells, NoLS mutated proteins mislocalized with a predeliction for cytoplasmic or nucleo-cytoplasmic localization and, finally, they resulted in overgrowth, consistent with a dominant negative interfering effect in the presence of the endogenous protein.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hyperparathyroidism Jaw-Tumour Syndrome (HPT-JT) is characterized by primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) (due to parathyroid carcinoma in 15% of cases), maxillary and mandible ossifying fibromas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], renal and uterine tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Inactivating mutations of the <italic>CDC73</italic>/<italic>HRPT2</italic> (henceforth <italic>CDC73</italic>) gene, encoding the 531 amino acid nuclear parafibromin protein, have been found in HPT-JT patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], while biallelic inactivation of this gene may be seen in sporadic parathyroid carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], consistent with a tumour suppressor function. <italic>CDC73</italic> gene inactivating mutations are also associated with other neoplasia such as clear cell, papillary, chromophobe renal cell carcinomas, oncocytomas, Wilms tumour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and more rarely biliary duct carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Parafibromin is a component of the PAF1 transcription complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] associating with RNA polymerase II to regulate several processes, from initiation of transcription to mRNA maturation, by associating with mRNA processing and polyadenylation factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Like its Drosophila homologue, Hyrax, human parafibromin interacts physically with the &#x3B2;-catenin protein via its conserved N-terminal sequence, suggesting a role in the regulation of WNT pathway targeted genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Being the parafibromin mainly a nuclear protein, it possesses different nuclear and nucleolar localisation signals (NLS and NoLS, respectively) that have been functionally investigated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p>
      <p>Inactivation of <italic>CDC73</italic> gene occurs frequently by frameshift or non-sense mutations while missense mutations are rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Among the naturally missense mutations, so far, only two variants were identified in the three NoLS: the p.Arg91Pro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and the p.Leu95Pro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], located within or close to the NoLS 76-92, respectively. Only p.Leu95Pro has been functionally characterized, showing that the mutated protein localizes to the nucleus, but fails to localize to the nucleoli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>Here we report the identification and the functional characterization of three different <italic>CDC73</italic> mutations located within NoLS 76-92, found in three subjects affected by PHPT due to parathyroid atypical adenoma or typical adenoma, the latter belonging to familial PHPT. These variants gave us the opportunity to explore the outcome of naturally-occurring missense mutations of the NoLS sequence about the parafibromin protein expression, function and localization.</p>

        <title>Case I</title>
        <p>At the age of 12 years (in 2001) the patient was referred to the Orthopedic Clinic (Town) due to persistent pain in the left ankle following a trauma. Conventional x-ray of the left lower extremity revealed a lesion in the distal tibia which was diagnosed as a &#x201C;non-ossifying fibroma&#x201D;. Two years later, the patient underwent distal supracondylar osteotomy at the Dept of Orthopedics of the Innsbruck Medical University, Austria, because of valgus deformity of the left femur. Postoperative course was complicated by polydipsia and vomiting and laboratory measurements revealed marked hypercalcemia and elevated parathyroid hormone. Clinical chemistry profile showed: albumin adjusted serum Ca 17.2 mg/dL (normal range 8.4-10.2), PTH: 571.8 pg/mL (10-72); calcitonin, gastrin and urinary catecholamines were normal. Unilateral exploration of the neck with resection of an adenoma of the left inferior parathyroid gland was performed. The pathological diagnosis was of parathyroid adenoma (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0082292-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>NoLS mutations: 3-D prediction</title>
        <p>Comparison of mutants with wild-type using a 3-D modelling approach offered further insight. In the WT protein, the NLS 125-139 sequence appears to be protruding, thus more likely available for binding with other recognition proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082292-g008">Figure 8a</xref>). By contrast, in the model of the R77P and delVV mutants, the NLS 125-139 sequence was invaginated into the inner of the protein. This is compatible with a steric hindrance mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082292-g008">Figure 8b and 8c</xref>). In the delENIP mutant model, the protein is strongly misfolded, both at the level of the NLS 125-139 sequence itself and because of the formation of two novel antiparallel &#x3B2; sheet fragments in the N-terminal tail (Aa 15-27, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082292-g008">Figure 8d</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The tumor suppressor <italic>CDC73</italic> gene has been identified as the main genetic determinant of the HPT-JT syndrome and parathyroid carcinoma. So far, more than 120 different coding inactivating mutations and different genomic deletions have been detected in this gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The vast majority of coding alterations are frameshift and nonsense, predicting a truncated protein. Only a few missense mutations (11 out of 124) have been reported and, among those, only two - p.Arg91Pro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and p.Leu95Pro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] - were associated with NoLS motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>We identified 4 <italic>CDC73</italic> gene mutations in 3 subjects affected by PHPT: 3 were germline, 1 was somatic. Three mutations were novel and fell into the NoLS and here we report their functional characterization.</p>
      <p>The three NoLS variants, one missense (R77P) and two in-frame deletions (delVV and delENIP), are expected to leave the primary peptide sequence unaltered and in turn retain expression of the protein, unlike nonsense and frameshift mutations. However, immunoblot detection showed that these variants affect the protein expression with a reduction of up to 85%. Secondly, we looked for possible disruption in the steady-state level of the mutated protein due to the identified NoLS variants, as reported for other tumor suppressor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The CHX assay demonstrated that the three NoLS mutations are short-lived compared to wild-type, and thus highly instable. After 48 h they were degraded by about 20% (for the R77P), 40% for the delENIP, and up to the 80% for delVV (with respect to the WT). This is consistent with the notion that an early proteolytic event is involved. </p>
      <p>Since we observed that proteasome inhibitor MG132 treatment was able to partially recover the CDC73 mutated protein (up to 80% with respect to untreated cells), we then sought if a concurrent pre-translational degradation process was also active. The RTqPCR assay, performed in presence of cycloheximide, offered a different picture. Two variants (delVV and delENIP) caused a strong reduction of the expression of corresponding mRNA (up to 54%) that was restored in presence of the translation inhibitor, suggesting that the increased instability of the mutated mRNAs might contribute to the whole loss of mutated protein products. With regard to the R77P variant, the mutated transcript was more expressed (up to 50%) than the WT: these contrary results, which in keeping with an earlier report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] deserve further study. </p>
      <p>In keeping with the tumor suppressor gene hypothesis, parafibromin mutations have been reported to induce cell growth and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We then verified if the NoLS variants acted in the same way. The MTT assay showed that the mutations affect the cell proliferation even in presence of the endogenous protein, while, as expected, the WT form showed a slower proliferation. These findings confirm previous observations about a possible dominant-negative interfering effect of the mutated parafibromin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>Bipartite nuclear/nucleolar localisation signals usually consist of two clusters of 2&#x2013;3 positively charged basic residues separated by a 9&#x2013;12 intermediate region containing proline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the parafibromin three bipartite NoLSs have been identified and characterized, the NoLS1 encompassing residues from 76 to 92 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Among these 17 aminoacids, the basic residues (Arg76-77 and Arg88-Lys92) have been proved to be essential for the function of the signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The NoLS 76-92 seems not to play a pivotal role in trafficking the protein into the nucleus, rather than into the nucleolus, thus the different classification in NoLS and NLS - Nuclear Localisation Signals, NLS1 125-139 and NLS2 393-409 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Moreover in absence of alterations of the primary NLS (125-139), mutations of NoLS 76-92 would not impair the nuclear localization of the parafibromin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p>
      <p>At the variance with these previous results but in keeping with others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], we observed that, of our three NoLS proteins, two (R77P and delVV) showed almost negligible nuclear expression. In the third case (delENIP) the protein localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Due to the low number of naturally occurring NoLS mutations so far identified and/or functional studies reported, we can not exclude that a role of other co-factors in this mis-localization. As suggested by the 3-D modelling approach, the NoLS mutations could induce a critical protein misfolding with a consequently inaccessibility of NLS 125-139 and the likely final impairing of binding with other co-factors (such as chaperonins and importins) assigned to the correct trafficking of nuclear proteins. In line with this hypothesis we predicted, in the same way, the NLS and NoLS conformation when the previously identified L95P mutation was introduced: the leucine-to-proline change seems to alter the folding of the protein, but in keeping with the reported nuclear localization of the mutated parafibromin, it seems not to influence the conformation nor the accessibility of the NLS sequence which remains at the outer surface of the protein structure.</p>
      <p>The loss of function associated with <italic>CDC73</italic> gene mutations is often coupled to the inability of parafibromin to bind the PAF1 complex and the RNA polymerase II. The binding between mutated parafibromin with these complexes and/or their co-factors, such as Leo1 and CTR9 (Paf1/RNA polymerase II complex component) has been investigated in other cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, the <italic>CDC73</italic> protein binding domain interacting with the PAFI complex is located at residues 226-413 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], far from the mutation sites reported here and it is unlikely that any variant at the positions 77-84 could interfere with a protein domain located more than 150 residues downstream. Thus in our cases we presumed that this binding domain was not influenced by the NoLS mutation. However as reported above, our NoLS mutated proteins were almost totally degraded and if not degraded, they mislocalized in 2 cases out of 3 (R77P and delVV) while the PAFI and their co-factors are nuclear, thus with no supposed interaction. In the third case (delENIP) the protein localized partially into the nucleus and we can not exclude that a correct interaction with the above mentioned complexes could occur (as already reported) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Nevertheless we believe that the main effect of these mutations resides in the high instability and, consequently, in the strong reduced expression of the mutated proteins.</p>
      <p>The different sensitization at the proteasome degradation pathway of missense mutations has been reported for other tumor suppressor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that proteolytic degradation is a relatively common mechanism for loss of function of tumor suppressor genes, at the same time giving rise to the possibility of new therapeutic interventions as proposed for other diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p>
      <p>In conclusion our work shed light on the outcome of novel mutations of the NoLS 76-92 of CDC73 gene. We found that the mutated proteins were highly instable and subjected to a critical transcriptional and translational degradation processes. Particularly the possibility that a pre-translational degradation may be responsible of loss of function of these mutated proteins will require further investigation. Moreover protein misfolding of the NoLS sequence might cause a dramatic displacement of the primary NLS 125-139, thus leading to a cytoplasmic mislocalisation of residual mutated protein product.</p>
