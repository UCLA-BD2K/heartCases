  <body>
    <p><bold>Clinical data</bold>: The patient reports that a heart murmur had been heard at
childhood; however, the diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta was made 1 month ago by
echocardiogram and CT scan, performed due to recent complaints of tired legs. She performed
physical activities on a regular basis and did not report headache. She was not receiving
any specific medication.</p>
    <p><bold>Physical examination</bold>: Normal breathing; acyanotic; brisk pulses in upper
limbs, absent in lower limbs. Weight: 58 kg; height: 166 cm; blood pressure (BP) in right
arm equal to that in left arm = 140/80 mmHg, BP in legs: 80 mmHg; heart rate (HR): 78 bpm;
oxygen saturation: 96%. Aorta clearly palpable on the suprasternal notch. Thrill and grade
1/4 mild systolic murmur on the suprasternal notch.</p>
    <p>The apical impulse was not palpable in the precordium, and there were no systolic impulses
on the left sternal border. Normal heart sounds; grade 1/4 systolic murmur in the aortic
area and back, both on the right and left sides. Liver not palpable.</p>

      <title>Laboratory tests</title>
      <p><bold>Electrocardiogram</bold> showed normal sinus rhythm with no signs of chamber
overload. The Sokolow index was 34 mm and there was no ventricular repolarization
abnormalities. PA: +60&#xBA;; QRSA: +70&#xBA;; TA: +40&#xBA;.</p>
      <p><bold>Chest radiograph</bold> showed normal cardiac silhouette (cardiothoracic ratio of
0.47). The pulmonary vascular network was normal and the arch of the pulmonary artery
was concave. The right upper arch was elongated, suggesting dilatation of the ascending
aorta (AscAo). The posterior aortic arch was somewhat prominent and the descending aorta
(DescAo) was dilated. Hyperdensity was observed in some ribs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="abc-104-03-0e19-g01"/>
      </fig>
      <p><bold>Echocardiogram</bold> showed bicuspid aortic valve with maximum and mean pressure
gradients of 31 and 17 mmHg, respectively. The AscAo was dilated (44 mm), the aortic
arch had 37 mm and the isthmic region was narrowed, with a pressure gradient of 47 mmHg.
The size of the cardiac chambers was normal, with no myocardial hypertrophy
(septum/posterior wall = 10 mm). Left ventricular function was normal (70%).</p>
      <p><bold>CT angiography of the aorta </bold>showed dilated AscAo (42&#xA0;mm), aortic crossing
(22 mm) and clear 8-mm diameter narrowing in the beginning of the DescAo, being 20 mm
diameter at the level of the diaphragm. There was marked collateral circulation.</p>
      <p><bold>Cardiac catheterization</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>).
Pressure levels were as follows: left ventricle (LV) = 160/12; AscAo = 140/82; and
DescAo = 100/80 mmHg. Angiography showed clear narrowing in the aortic isthmus and
dilatation of the AscAo and DescAo.</p>

      <p><bold>Clinical diagnosis:</bold> Severe coarctation of the aorta in the isthmic region
and mild aortic valve stenosis in a bicuspid valve with marked ascending aorta
dilatation, in natural course.</p>
      <p><bold>Clinical reasoning: </bold>The clinical elements of coarctation of the aorta are
clear and easy to identify, and are mainly represented by contrasting pulses and BP
between the upper and lower limbs. Noteworthy, despite the long-standing heart disease
with pressure overload, no myocardial hypertrophy or signs of electric overload are
observed, and the symptoms are recent and mild. This results from the development of an
efficient collateral circulation. Chest radiograph with normal cardiac silhouette
expresses preserved ventricular function, and AscAo dilatation suggests the possibility
of DescAo obstruction, in addition to the aortic valve stenosis.</p>
      <p><bold>Differential diagnosis:</bold> Aortic obstruction in adulthood generally results
from previous aortitis, as occurs in Takayasu and Kawasaki diseases; connective tissue
diseases; and infectious diseases, such as syphilis.</p>
      <p><bold>Management:</bold> In view of the long-standing systolic impact, even without
myocardial hypertrophy and with increased pressures in the proximal aorta circuit,
operation is mandatory aiming at relieving the arterial obstruction, which would imply a
greater possibility of development of myocardial fibrosis, heart failure, arrhythmias
and earlier death. Dilatation of the isthmic region was chosen using therapeutic cardiac
catheterization from the right femoral artery with placement of a 40 x 20-mm stent just
past the origin of the left subclavian artery. BP levels immediately increased to 200
mmHg and decreased in the sequence. Adequate enlargement of the region was achieved
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure&#xA0;2</xref>) with equalization of pressures
between limbs. Severe chest pain extending to the back persisted for 12&#xA0;hours,
accompanied by BP elevation to 150/100&#xA0;mmHg; both were relieved by dolantine and
beta&#x2011;blockers. BP decreased to normal levels of 125/80 mmHg in upper and lower limbs.
The systolic murmur of aortic valve stenosis remained unchanged.</p>
      <p><bold>Commentaries: </bold>Obstructive congenital anomaly usually manifests early in
life by means of a heart murmur. In sudden obstruction during the neonatal period, as
occurs in coarctation of the aorta, classic signs of congestive heart failure appear and
require immediate surgical intervention. Cardiac compensation with maintained antegrade
flow is achieved by the myocardial hypertrophy and development of collateral
circulation. In the present case, the favorable course up to the fourth decade of life,
with more recent manifestation of symptoms, resulted from an efficient collateral
circulation. Even when it causes less impact, this obstructive anomaly should be treated
earlier to prevent an unfavorable outcome in relation to the development of myocardial
fibrosis, arrhythmias and heart failure. In the course of bicuspid aortic valve,
unfavorable elements such as AscAo dilatation with deficiency of the parietal
muscle<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> arise, and this should
be invariably treated surgically in due time.</p>
