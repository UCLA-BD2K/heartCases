      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Free perforation of the colon is one of the most serious abdominal emergencies, often
warranting prompt exploratory laparotomy. We report a case of laparoscopic repair of
a postoperative colorectal anastomotic leak. Laparoscopic repair of colonic
perforations associated with colonoscopy has been well reported in the literature.
We propose, however, that this practice is also a safe and appealing choice for the
correction of a wider range of anomalies in carefully selected patients with colonic
perforation.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>An 86-year-old man with a history of hypertension and idiopathic thrombocytopenia
purpura (ITP) presented to the emergency department with approximately 12 hours of
lower abdominal discomfort and bloating. The patient denied nausea or vomiting,
fever, or chills, but had a loose nonbloody bowel movement earlier that day. On
examination, his abdomen was distended, tympanitic, and nontender with hypoactive
bowel sounds. Hemoccult was negative. He had reported similar complaints a month
earlier from a sigmoid volvulus that had been decompressed colonoscopically without
surgical intervention.</p>
      <p>CT examination revealed a dilated colon and small bowel with a transition point in
the area of the mid-sigmoid colon consistent with recurrent sigmoid volvulus.
Intraoperative findings during laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy were notable for a
large dilated redundant sigmoid colon. Given this redundancy, minimal mobilization
was required. Once this was completed, the sigmoid colon was delivered through a
small LLQ incision and was resected in the usual fashion. A colorectal anastomosis
was made with a laparoscopic circular stapler in an end-to-end fashion. Pathology
revealed a benign colon with neuromuscular hypertrophy. The patient was doing well
postoperatively and tolerating a regular diet by postoperative day 3. On the
following postoperative day, however, he complained of labored breathing. His
abdomen was distended, but nontender; his incisions were clean and intact. An
obstruction series revealed markedly dilated loops of small bowel with elevated
hemidiaphragms. CT of the abdomen and pelvis with Gastrografin revealed large
amounts of free intraperitoneal air without contrast extravasation <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>)</bold>.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="jls0041128060001"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Two hours after initial decompensation, the patient continued to deteriorate
clinically, with increased abdominal distension and labored breathing requiring
intubation. During an emergent diagnostic laparoscopy, a small hole was found at his
colorectal anastomosis with a small to moderate amount of seropurulent fluid. No
inflammatory changes were detected elsewhere in the abdomen. The anastomotic leak
was oversewn laparoscopically, protected with an omental patch, and a diverting loop
ileostomy was created through a separate right lower quadrant incision. Preoperative
stoma siting was not performed, given the emergent nature of the procedure.</p>
      <p>The patient did well postoperatively and was discharged to a skilled nursing
facility, tolerating a regular diet on postoperative day 7. The patient was
instructed to resume his home medications, continue oral antibiotics for the next 7
days, and follow-up in our office 3 weeks after discharge. He continues to follow-up
at regular 6-month intervals. The patient has done well in his postoperative
follow-up without any further complications of his initial or subsequent
procedures.</p>

    <sec sec-type="discussion">
      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Over the past 15 years, laparoscopy has become increasingly popular in the management
of abdominal emergencies. It offers high diagnostic yields, equal outcomes, and more
aesthetically pleasing results compared with open approaches, culminating in high
patient satisfaction. The vast majority of these procedures involve operative
treatment of peritonitis secondary to biliary, appendiceal, and pelvic
disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In the data supporting laparoscopic repair of colon perforations, most reports
describe its use in diverticular disease and iatrogenic injury secondary to
colonoscopy. In 2 large retrospective case control studies, Agresta et al describe
21 of 36 cases of colonoscopic perforations that were repaired laparoscopically, 16
of which were secondary to diverticular, and 3 to iatrogenic,
perforations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup> Its use in these conditions has
increased secondary to the minimal abdominal soilage (from contained abscesses in
diverticular disease, and bowel preparation in colonoscopy), as well as early
recognition of disease (from direct visualization of the peritoneal cavity by
colonoscopy and early availability of CT scan).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In the case described herein, a compromised anastomotic staple line was oversewn
laparoscopically and reinforced with an omental patch. The patient's injury was
identified 3 days after the initial operation, but the defect was small and only
minimal fecal soilage of the abdomen had occurred. Patient disease, size of
perforation, medical comorbidities, as well as delay to diagnosis are all factors
that contributed to the ability to care for these patients with a minimally invasive
approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup> Although rapid
diagnosis is essential to avoid resection and colostomy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup> if the presumed injury (or the injury observed
during diagnostic laparoscopy) is small, and intraabdominal contamination is
minimal, this technique can be expanded to abdominal emergencies where immediate
recognition of injury or pathology did not occur.</p>
      <p>The advantages of laparoscopy are well described. It allows for smaller wound sizes
that are less likely to develop hernias or infection, which effectively eliminate
the risk of dehiscence or evisceration. Minimal manipulation of abdominal contents
allows for faster return of bowel function. Reduced postoperative pain also
decreases the interval to ambulation, overall hospital stay, and reduces the number
of restrictions imposed on the patient at discharge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup> The diagnostic yield of the laparoscope is also
invaluable at very little risk to the patient, always leaving the option of
conversion to laparotomy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup> especially in cases of extensive
peritoneal irritation, massive fecal soilage, or complex colonic injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In an increasingly aging population, the draw towards minimally invasive techniques
as an alternative to classic open procedures is apparent. In a recent retrospective
study at our institution, all colectomies in patients over 80 years old in a 5-year
period were examined. Of the 289 nonemergent operations included in the study, 150
were done laparoscopically. This group had an overall lower mortality (8.4%
vs. 2%, p=.0132), lower incidence of postoperative ileus (22%
vs. 10%, p = 0.0112), shorter hospital stay (11.15 days vs. 7.11 days,
p=.0001), and lower incidence of nursing home discharge (49% vs.
22%, p&lt; .0001).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref></sup> The
advantages outlined above could play a decisive role when formulating a treatment
plan for an elderly patient with potentially devastating intraabdominal
pathology.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="conclusions">
      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>Our case demonstrates that diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopy is a safe and
appealing choice for not only the correction of postcolonoscopic perforation, but
also for a carefully selected group of other patients with free colonic perforation,
even if these patients present later in the course of their disease. It also
suggests a minimally invasive approach may be advantageous in the care of an
increasingly aging population, as in our case of an 86-year-old individual.</p>
