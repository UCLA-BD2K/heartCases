      <title>1. CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 32-year-old Caucasian woman with BMI 46 presented to &#x201C;A&amp;E&#x201D; with
dysuria, urinary frequency, and incontinence, along with bilateral loin
tenderness and vomiting. Her initial observations were as follows: pulse 135,
BP 151/114, and temp. 36.6. Urine dipstick revealed 3+ protein, blood,
leucocytes, and ketones. Liver and renal function tests, uric acid, amylase,
random blood sugar, and clotting screen were within normal range; Hb 10.0,
white cell count of 26.2 with Neutrophils at 23.32, platelets 454, and
C<italic>&#xDF;</italic>reactive protein &gt;180&#x2009;mg/L. Haematology report also showed microcytic
hypochromic blood picture. Midstream urine was sent for culture and sensitivity.
The immediate impression was that of acute pyelonephritis and treatment
commenced with IV Cefuroxime and surgical review requested. On abdominal
examination, a large, mobile, nontender mass was palpated with positive
urine pregnancy test.</p>
      <p>Subsequently, transabdominal scan revealed a single live term fetus with
cephalic presentation, reduced liquor (amniotic fluid index of 5), effective foetal
weight of 3.9&#x2009;kg,
and with right lateral placenta. She was then transferred to delivery suite.
This was her first pregnancy and both partners were unaware of the ongoing
pregnancy until diagnosed. She gave vague history of constant vaginal
discharge. Until then, she was on continuous contraceptive pills. Past medical
and surgical history suggested nothing significant, and there was no ongoing
psychiatric illness. Interestingly, she presented to general practitioner (GP)
at least twice with complaints of backache and urinary symptoms prior to
delivery. Although GP recommended
treatment for UTI with trimethoprim, she did not take them due to those
medications causing sickness.</p>
      <p>Upon admission to delivery suite, her observations were pulse 127, BP
160/102, and temp. 37.6 with 3 in 10 uterine contractions. Also noted were 2+
generalised oedema, 3+ proteinuria, and normal reflexes. Cardiotocograph
reading showed baseline tachycardia at 170, variability &lt;5, no accelerations,
and variable decelerations. Vaginal examination revealed cervix 5&#x2009;cm dilated,
1+ caput, vertex &#x2212;2 station, and malodorous vaginal discharge on rupture of
membranes. She underwent emergency caesarean section under GA for fetal
distress, severe chorioamnionitis, and moderate preecclampsia. There was delay
in starting the caesarean due to difficulty in securing the IV access, three
failed attempts at spinal, failed catheterisation as pus pouring from the
vagina, and due to body habitus.</p>
      <p>A live male baby weighing 4400&#x2009;grams was delivered and handed over to
paediatrician. Intraoperative findings revealed offensive liquor in the form of
frank pus draining from the uterus, J-shaped uterine incision due to difficulty
in delivering the shoulders, pus draining from foetal nose and mouth, normal
looking bilateral tubes and ovaries, and a corrugated catheter drain left in
the peritoneal cavity due to peritoneal contamination of uterine contents.
Vagina was swabbed and Foleys catheter was inserted into bladder. Estimated blood loss
was at 700&#x2009;mL.</p>
      <p>Placental and cervical swabs were taken for culture and sensitivity, and
placenta was sent for histology. Postoperatively IV Augmentin continued for 48&#x2009;hours
and then oral for 21&#x2009;days, Labetalol 200&#x2009;mg orally twice daily for 2&#x2009;weeks,
iron supplements for next 3&#x2009;months, subcutaneous Tinzaparin 4500 IU for 5&#x2009;days,
and leg stockings until she mobilised. She also received 3&#x2009;units of blood transfusion
in view of her Hb 6.1&#x2009;gm/dL. All her observations including haematological and
biochemical parameters improved over 72&#x2009;hours. Drain removed on Day six. She
was rubella immune and negative for Hepatitis B, Syphilis, and HIV 1 and 2. No
pathogenic organisms isolated from urine specimen, placental, and cervical
swabs. Placental tissue on culture exhibited scanty growth of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> sensitive to Ceftazidime, Ciprofloxacin, Gentamicin, Imipenem, and Tazocin. She
recuperated uneventfully and discharged home on Day 16.</p>
      <p>The APGAR scores for the baby at 1, 5, 10, and 20&#x2009;minutes were 2, 3, 5,
and 7, respectively. Baby was in poor condition at birth and had to be
resuscitated and admitted to Special Care Baby Unit. Arterial and venous blood
gas pH values were 7.217 and 7.130, respectively. Similarly arterial and venous
base deficits were &#x2212;8.9 and &#x2212;7.9&#x2009;mmol/L. Baby developed septicaemia due to <italic>Staphylococcus
epidermis</italic> and were treated with antibiotics for seven days. There were
developmental delays and a diagnosis of Grade 3 hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy
was made. Baby was discharged home on Day 22 after establishing bottle feeds.</p>

      <title>2. DISCUSSION</title>
      <p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is primarily a nocosomial pathogen, Gram-negative, aerobic,
rod-shaped bacterium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Among several commensal flora in the vagina, <italic>Pseudomonas
aeruginosa</italic> accounts for nearly 2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Chorioamnionitis due to <italic>Pseudomonas
aeruginosa</italic> is rare and its importance is due to its virulence, with high
neonatal morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].
<italic>Pseudomonas chorioamnionitis</italic> are mostly reported among women with PPROM and in their babies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. One of the risk factors identified in literature is prolonged antibiotic
therapy in these women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In the case presented, reported infection
might have been either community-acquired or opportunistic, due to altered
local vaginal flora or generalised immune suppression with haematogenous
dissemination. Chorioamnionitis per se could be due to prolonged rupture of
membranes or consequent upon urinary tract infection although infection with
intact membranes cannot be ruled out due to its high virulence. She gave no
history suggestive of prolonged antibiotic therapy. Low socioeconomic status, poor
maternal nutrition, and the fact no antenatal care may all have predisposed to
this highly virulent pathogenic chorioamnionitis. Gestational diabetes is not
ruled out. Consequently, poor outcome of the baby at delivery is the result of
severe chorioamnionitis leading to unsafe intrauterine milieu. The <italic>Staphylococcus
epidermis</italic> sepsis in the neonate could have been acquired following
delivery, especially with interventions such as mechanical ventilation and
intubation. Our patient was at risk of septicaemia, shock, disseminated
intravascular coagulopathy, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan
failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Despite the low incidence of maternal morbidity, these women should be
regarded as high-risk labor due to increased perinatal morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Negative placental swabs may be due to IV Cefuroxime commenced earlier in
A&amp;E for UTI to which the organism was susceptible as revealed in the
placental tissue culture. The reason for starting and continuing Augmentin was
due to departmental protocol and for its broad-spectrum activity, as well as
improvement in patients&#x2019; clinical condition.</p>
      <p>This case by definition is a true denial of pregnancy. In other words,
unconscious denial of pregnancy whereby pregnancy is denied at all levels&#x2014;physiological, psychological, and social [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The
prevalence of this kind of pregnancy is 1 out of every 2455 births, wherein the
fetus was born without any preceding subjective awareness of pregnancy on the
part of the woman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p>
      <p>During postnatal period, appropriate counseling had been given with regard to parenting skills and referral made to social services. A named midwife and health visitor had been appointed to provide any assistance that this woman and her baby may require. Recent evidence suggests that psychiatric consultation was rare for women who had denied or concealed their pregnancies, and yet they would often subsequently take responsibility for their infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p>
      <p>It is important to
provide multidisciplinary consultant-led care when the patient is in the
hospital and liaise with other professionals, such as social services,
community midwife, and health care visitors to provide high quality of care to
these patients.</p>
      <p>It is difficult to understand what led to
total ignorance or insensible to pregnancy changes until full term and
delivery. Probably social, psychological, physical factors, or all of them had a role to
play. Educating
the community especially morbidly obese women if they put on excessive weight
or with irregular periods should seek doctor's advice and exclude pregnancy.
For the primary care provider it is of great importance to exclude pregnancy in
any reproductive woman presenting with abdominal complaints.</p>
      <p>This case also brings to clinicians notice that Pseudomonas may have
been acquired in the community and affect term pregnancies with intact or
prolonged rupture of membranes.</p>
