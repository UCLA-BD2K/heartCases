        <p>Myopic strabismus fixus is characterized by severe ocular
motility restriction with the development of progressive
esotropia and hypotropia. Management of severe cases with
strongly positive forced duction test can be challenging. We
describe a longstanding case of myopic strabismus fixus, which
was managed by bilateral medial rectus disinsertion and scleral
fixation laterally to the periosteum.</p>

      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>A 76-year-old myope presented to us with complaints of
defective vision and turning in of the eyes since the last 10 years.
The patient reported that the right cornea had not been visible
for the past eight years due to a considerable convergent
deviation. His left eye had also started to turn inwards over
the past two years. As a result his vision was hindered thus
interfering with daily activities.</p>
      <p>On examination, the best corrected visual acuity in the
right eye was perception of light with accurate projection and
in the left eye, counting fingers at 1.5 meters with accurate
projection. His glasses had a prescription of -6.5 diopter
sphere with -1.50 diopter cylinder at 175 degrees in the right
eye and -21.00 diopters in the left eye. Refraction was not
possible due to the dense cataract in both eyes. Axial lengths
were 32.70 mm in the left eye and 27.80 mm in the right eye.
The right eye was severely esotropic with some hypotropia
(which could not be measured as the eye could not take up
fixation) and only the edge of the cornea could be visualized.
The left eye showed esotropia of more than 90 prism diopters
[<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Ocular motility examination showed limitation
of ocular movements in all directions of gaze, with minimal
residual adduction. There was mild bilateral aponeurotic ptosis.
Anterior segment examination revealed dense nuclear cataract
in both eyes. Fundus could not be visualized in the right eye
due to the severe esotropia and in the left eye, media was
hazy and the retina tessellated with a posterior staphyloma.
Ultrasound B scan showed increased axial length and posterior
staphyloma in both eyes. Imaging was not performed due to
cost considerations.</p>
      <p>During surgery, severe restriction of ocular movements
was noted in both eyes on forced duction testing, with only
minimal adduction possible. Hooking of the medial rectus
was difficult. The medial rectus muscle was disinserted at its
insertion in both eyes. However, there was a large residual
esotropia and forced duction testing did not reveal any
remarkable improvement in the restriction after disinsertion.
A conjunctival incision was made over the lateral rectus
insertion. The conjunctiva was retracted laterally using a
retractor. 6-0 prolene suture was then passed through the
sclera just anterior to the lateral rectus insertion and then
through the periosteum on the inner aspect of the lateral
orbital wall, 2 mm inside the orbital rim. The suture was
tugged to confirm passage through the periosteum and the
conjunctiva was closed with 8-0 vicryl interrupted sutures
[<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. The eyes were left in a position of 8-10 prism
diopters of abduction.</p>
      <p>At six months of follow-up, there was residual esotropia
of 20 prism diopters in the right eye with 25 prism diopters of
hypotropia, however, the left eye was in the primary position
with central fixation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. Ocular motility examination
revealed limitation in all directions with minimal adduction.
He had undergone cataract surgery in the left eye with a best
corrected visual acuity of 20/60.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Acquired strabismus fixus was described by Villaseca<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> and
Martinez,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> who ascribed this to contracture of the medial rectus
following lateral rectus paralysis. Acquired strabismus fixus
has also been reported to be associated with amyloidosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> and
high myopia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></p>
      <p>Restrictive ocular motility problems have been known to
occur in high myopes. The currently accepted theory was
given by Yokoyama, who suggested that the enlarged globe
herniates superotemporally through the muscle cone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> On
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the superior rectus is seen
to be nasally deviated and the lateral rectus muscle inferiorly
deviated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> Krzizok <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> noted a
change in the muscle path of the lateral rectus muscle on MRI. They noticed an inferior
displacement of the lateral rectus muscle.</p>
      <p>Several surgical procedures have been attempted to treat
convergent strabismus fixus in high myopes. Hayashi <italic>et al</italic>.,
found medial rectus recession-lateral rectus resection to be
effective only in small deviations and performed transposition
of the superior rectus and inferior rectus along with medial
rectus recession in cases with severe limitation of abduction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
Krzizok <italic>et al</italic>., fixed the lateral rectus muscle with a posterior
fixation suture in the physiological meridian to the sclera.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
In order to compensate for the inferolateral displacement of
the lateral rectus muscle, Yokoyama <italic>et al</italic>., performed a loop
myopexy of the lateral and superior rectus muscles. Marked
improvement in eye movement was noted. This is probably the
best procedure as it addresses the problem of deviant muscle
paths.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> Wong <italic>et al</italic>. performed loop myopexy of the lateral and
superior rectus muscle with a silicon 240 band and tightening
with a sleeve with a satisfactory result.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Good outcome was
noted with a partial Jensen&#x2032;s procedure to appose the adjacent
halves of the lateral and superior rectus muscles by Larsen <italic>et
al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> Periosteal fixation of the sclera has been performed for third
nerve palsy with satisfactory results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> In addition periosteal flaps
have been used as globe tethers in severe paretic strabismus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></p>
      <p>Our patient had longstanding strabismus fixus with severe
esotropia. The eyes were not aligned, even after medial rectus
disinsertion and considerable resistance was felt on forced
duction testing. Considering the resistance and the chance
of recurrence, we went ahead with scleral fixation of the
eyeball to the periosteum near the lateral orbital rim. Marked
fibrosis possibly occurs in longstanding cases and procedures
like transpositions or recession-resection may not be useful.
This might also be the cause for the persistent restriction
to abduction after medial rectus disinsertion. The right eye
which was more severely afflicted initially was noted to have
a residual esotropia and hypotropia. However, the left eye
could be restored to the primary position. It is interesting
that the less myopic right eye was the severely esotropic eye;
the exact cause for this is unclear, but it could be related to
more severe fibrosis associated with this eye. Imaging would
have been useful to delineate the paths of the muscles. Loop
myopexy addresses the basic problem, however, as the medial
rectus was very tight on forced duction testing, our choice of
surgical procedure was disinsertion and periosteal fixation. To
conclude, scleral fixation can be considered as a surgical option
in patients with gross restriction on forced duction testing in
severe myopic strabismus fixus.</p>

left eye showed esotropia of more than 90 prism diopters. In addition
there was mild bilateral aponeurotic ptosis</p>
