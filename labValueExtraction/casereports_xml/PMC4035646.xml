Additional surgery was deemed necessary, and he was referred to our department. Preoperative computed tomography showed no liver or lung metastasis. The preoperative diagnosis was cStage IA (pT1b1, cN0, cH0, cP0, and cM0). Standard LADG with LND (D1+No.7, 8a, 9) was performed successfully. Histological examination disclosed stage IB (pT1b1, pN1, sH0, sP0, and sM0). The patient was discharged on postoperative day 14 after an uneventful postoperative course. Eighteen months after the operation, he is doing well without recurrent gastric cancer.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Situs inversus totalis (SIT) is a rare congenital anomaly with an incidence of only approximately 1 in 5,000 to 20,000 and denotes complete right-left inversion of thoracic and abdominal viscera.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Although laparoscopic experience in such patients often has been reported on, most reported cases are of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Reports of advanced laparoscopic surgeries are increasing in accord with progress in laparoscopic procedures. However, reports of laparoscopic surgery for malignancy in patients with SIT are very few, and only 4 such laparoscopic surgeries with lymphadenectomy have been reported in the English literature.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">&#x2013;</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Of these, only 2 were of laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG).<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Here, we present the third case.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 42-y-old man with SIT visited the Department of Internal Medicine in our hospital with the previous diagnosis of early gastric cancer found by upper endoscopy (EGD). EGD performed at our hospital showed an irregularly shaped, slightly depressed lesion on the posterior wall of the antrum <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, B)</bold>, and the patient underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C)</bold>. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen revealed a 0-IIc lesion that was a submucosal moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, ly (+), v (&#x2013;), UL (&#x2013;), HM0, VM0, R0, according to the Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Because &#x201C;ly(+)&#x201D; is a risk factor for lymph node metastasis, additional surgery was recommended according to the Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment Guidelines.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Thereafter, he visited our department, where he underwent a preoperative physical examination and laboratory tests, the results of which were normal.</p>

      <p>Chest radiography showed dextrocardia from the frontal view <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>)</bold>. Upper gastrointestinal imaging (UGI) revealed a scar from past ESD at the greater curvature <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>)</bold>. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed that all organs inside the abdomen were inversely positioned <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A)</bold>. Although the left hepatic artery was branched from the supramesenteric artery, courses of other blood vessels were normal <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B)</bold>. Chest and abdominal CT did not reveal any metastases, including those to the liver or lung. Based on findings of the histopathological examination, UGI, and CT, a 0-IIc lesion on the posterior wall of the antrum, post-ESD, invasion depth sm, pT1b1, cN0, cH0, cP0, cM0, stage IA was diagnosed according to the Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma. LADG with standard lymph node dissection (LND) (D1+No. 7, 8a, 9) was performed in accord with the Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment Guidelines.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>

      <p>After general anesthesia was induced, the patient was placed in a supine position. First, a 12-mm trocar was placed, using Hasson's technique, in the umbilical site, and carbon dioxide was injected into the peritoneal cavity at 10 mm Hg. A laparoscope was inserted into the abdomen through the 12-mm trocar. An additional 5 ports were placed in the epigastric, left and right hypochondriac, and lateral abdominal regions <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>)</bold>. The surgeon was positioned on the left side of the patient for dissection of lymph node nos. 4sb, 5, 7, 8a, and 9 and was positioned on the right side for the dissection of lymph node no. 6. The positions of both the surgeon and assistant were opposite to their usual positions.</p>

      <p>First, the great omentum was dissected. The spleen was confirmed, and the right gastroepiploic vessels were clipped and incised. Consecutively, the area of lymph node no. 6 (infrapyloric lymph node) was dissected, and the duodenum was transected with a linear stapling device using a disposable gastrointestinal (GI) cartridge (Echelon 60; Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) intraperitoneally. Areas of no. 5 (suprapyloric lymph node), no. 8a (lymph node along the common hepatic artery), no. 9 (lymph node around the celiac artery), no. 7 (lymph node along the left gastric artery), no. 1 (right pericardial lymph node), and no. 3 (lymph node along the lesser curvature) lymph nodes were dissected safely and completely in accord with Gastric Cancer Treatment Guidelines <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>)</bold>. Then, the extraperitoneal procedure was performed. After inflation was stopped, the incision of the epigastric region, where the trocar was inserted, was extended vertically to 5cm. Billroth I reconstruction was performed using a circular stapler (ECS29; Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Somerville, NJ). Operating time was 313 min, and blood loss was 90 mL.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Situs inversus (SI) is a rare congenital anomaly in which the organs are transposed from their normal site to the opposite side of the body. SIT denotes complete inversion of thoracic and abdominal viscera.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">&#x2013;</xref><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Apart from a genetic predisposition, no causes have been established. SI itself has no pathophysiologic significance,<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> although cardiovascular malformations (8%) and bronchiectasis (10%) are often present.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> With SIT, abnormal vascularization of the arteries and veins are common; therefore, preoperative confirmation of any abnormal vascularization is very important, because abnormal vascularization involves the risk of misidentifying anatomy and unanticipated injury of important vessels in the LND. Particularly with laparoscopic surgery, it is essential to determine the presence of vascular anomalies by preoperative CT or angiography, because with laparoscopic surgery, we cannot confirm directly the location of vessels by palpation.</p>
      <p>In the report of Iwamura et al.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> several cases having the combination of SIT and a malignant tumor, such as cancer of the lung, stomach, liver, colon, and rectum, were described. Only 2 cases of laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer complicated by SIT have been reported in the English literature.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Surgical procedures, especially laparoscopic procedures, are considered more difficult in patients with SIT than in other patients because of the mirror-image anatomy. Thus, because laparoscopic surgery on patients with SIT presents technical challenges for the surgeon, it remains relatively rare. However, in our case, we encountered few technical difficulties in the laparoscopic procedure, because we had acquired images of the anatomy and paid attention to the fundamentals of laparoscopic procedures, such as the careful handling of devices and keeping the operating field dry. Accurate preoperative anatomic assessment and careful preoperative planning of laparoscopic procedures (e.g., positions of surgeon, assistants, and trocar sites as well as instrumentation) are needed to ensure a safe, smooth procedure.</p>
      <p>In the case of laparoscopic surgery, a principal advantage is that the operating field is magnified, which is especially helpful, for example, for visualizing vessels and nerves. Even in advanced surgery with radical lymphadenectomy in a patient with SIT, an accurate recognition of the patient's anatomy and careful adherence to the fundamentals of laparoscopic procedures can enable a safe operation without the distraction of a mirror-image anatomy. Laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer with SIT thus should be considered a feasible, safe, and curative procedure that surgeons should not hesitate to perform.</p>
