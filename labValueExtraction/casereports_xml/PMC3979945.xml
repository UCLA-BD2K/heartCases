        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>A 9-month-old steer was autopsied due to recurrent ruminal tympany. A
macroscopic examination found an enlarged caudal mediastinal lymph node, and a section of
the lymph node revealed necrosis with marked calcification, similar to tuberculous
lymphadenitis. Histopathologically, the lesion consisted of multiple coagulative necrotic
foci and fibrosis with macrophage, lymphocyte, eosinophil and multinucleated giant cell
infiltration. Non-uniform width hyphae were detected in the necrotic area and within the
cytoplasm of the multinucleated giant cells, and they were found to be
anti-<italic>Rhizopus arrhizus</italic> antibody positive in an immunohistochemical
examination. Therefore, the steer was diagnosed with necrotic caudal mediastinal
lymphadenitis due to zygomycetes infection, and inhibition of eructation by the enlarged
lymph node was the likely cause of the ruminal tympany.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Zygomycosis is an opportunistic fungal infection caused by the fungi that used to belong to
the class Zygomycetes, which includes <italic>Mucor</italic>, <italic>Rhizopus</italic> and
<italic>Absidia</italic>. Recently, based on the results of molecular phylogenetic analysis,
Zygomycota have been reclassified into a new division, Glomeromycota, and four subdivisions of
<italic>incertae sedis</italic>, Mucoromycotina, Entomophthoromycota, Kickxellomycotina and
Zoopagomycotina [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although the term &#x201C;zygomycosis&#x201D; is
commonly used for mucormycosis, zygomycosis was originally the name for two diseases,
mucormycosis and entomophthoramycosis [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The term
&#x201C;zygomycosis&#x201D; is preferred to mucormycosis when the diagnosis is made on tissue sections
without culture confirmation, and the clinicopathology of mucormycosis and
entomophthoramycosis overlap [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
    <p>The pathogens are ubiquitous within the environment of cattle and can be isolated from air
[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, zygomycetes, such as <italic>Mucor
pusillus</italic> and <italic>Lichtheimia corymbifera,</italic> are members of normal rumen
flora [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].
Infection can occur with a disruption of the normal balance between animals and agents [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which has been associated with several factors, such as
ruminal acidosis and broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs, that affect the normal flora in the
forestomachs [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
    <p>The main portal of entry for zygomycetes is the gastrointestinal mucosa in cattle [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which results in alimentary mycosis and systemic
mycosis. Zygomycotic lymphadenitis has been observed as a lesion of alimentary and systematic
mycosis or detected incidentally in slaughtered cattle with no clinical signs [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The lesions have consisted of necrotizing granulomatous
inflammation [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and shown tuberculosis-like
lymphadenitis. Although similar lesions have been reported mainly in mesenteric lymph nodes of
slaughtered cattle [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], zygomycotic mediastinal
lymphadenitis is rare in cattle, and there have been no reports of a clinical case of
zygomycotic lymphadenitis in young cattle in Japan. Here, we report an additional case of a
young beef steer with solitary caudal mediastinal lymphadenitis due to a zygomycetes infection
that could result in ruminal tympany.</p>
    <p>A 9-month-old Japanese black steer was submitted for examination to diagnose the cause of
recurrent ruminal tympany. The steer had developed subacute ruminal tympany at the age of
seven months and thereafter had several reoccurrences of severe ruminal tympany for 2 months.
There were no abnormal findings using esophagography. After X-ray fluoroscopy, the problem was
suspected to be a ruminal foreign body. The steer underwent a rumenotomy, and a mass of rope
was removed; however, the cattle showed no improvement of its condition.</p>
    <p>On gross pathological examination, an elongated mass (20 &#xD7; 5 &#xD7; 5 cm) was observed between the
thoracic aorta and the esophagus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1a</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Caudal mediastinal lymph node. (a) Enlarged caudal mediastinal lymph node (arrow)
between the thoracic aorta (TA) and esophagus (E). (b) Cross section of the caudal
mediastinal lymph node. Note the grayish white necrosis and yellow-white coarse
calcification in the central area. A pale pink, solid area was found in the peripheral
area of the cross section of the nodule (white arrowheads). Bar=1 cm. (c) Granulomatous
lesions consisted of severe multinucleated giant cell infiltration and fibrous

adjacent tissues. It consisted of large and small nodules, and grayish white necrosis and
yellow-white coarse calcification were observed in the central area of cross sections of both
nodules, which resembled tuberculous lymphadenitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.
1b</xref>). A pale pink, solid area was found in a peripheral area of a cross section of a
nodule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1b</xref>, white arrowheads). The other
mediastinal lymph nodes showed only mild enlargement. Also, there were no significant findings
in other organs, except for an ulcerating lesion about 2 cm in diameter in the abomasum, mild
thickening of the small intestine, mild enlargement of the mesenteric lymph node and a
yellow-green fibrin clot formation in the anterior part of the thoracic cavity. The fibrin
clot was likely the result of stimulation by catheter insertion into the rumen to remove the
gas.</p>
    <p>The major organs, including the mediastinal lymph nodes, were collected, fixed in 15%
formalin, embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 4 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>m. Sections were routinely
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Grocott&#x2019;s methenamine
silver and Ziehl-Neelsen methods. Immunohistochemistry was performed on the sections of the
caudal mediastinal lymph node with a mouse anti-<italic>Rhizopus arrhizus</italic> monoclonal
antibody (MCA2577, AbD Serotec, Oxford, U.K.) as the primary antibody and a secondary antibody
conjugated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled polymer (EnVision+ kit, Dako, Denmark A/S). The
chromogen was developed with 3,3&#x2032;-diaminobenzidine (DAB; ImmPACT DAB<sup>&#xAE;</sup>, Vector
Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, U.S.A.).</p>
    <p>To discover the point of entry of the fungi, the mediastinal lymph node, abomasum and small
intestine were analyzed by PCR. Briefly, the fungal-specific DNA was extracted from the
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue using a commercial kit (QIAamp<sup>&#xAE;</sup> DNA FFPE
Tissue Kit; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and amplified with the previously described fungal
primers TW13 (5&#x2032;- GGT CCG TGT TTC AAG ACG- 3&#x2032;) and Ctb6 (5&#x2032;-GCA TAT CAA TAA GCG GAG G-3&#x2032;)
[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The
PCR mixture (25 <italic>&#xB5;l</italic> total volume) contained 2.5 <italic>&#xB5;l</italic> of 10&#xD7; PCR
Buffer with 7.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.7 U of polymerase (Expand High Fidelity PCR System;
Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan) and 200 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>M concentrations of each
deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP Mixture; Takara Bio, Tokyo, Japan) and 800 nM of each
primer and 1 <italic>&#xB5;l</italic> of DNA extract as a template. Amplification was performed
under the following conditions: one cycle of 95&#xB0;C for 10 min; 35 cycles at 94&#xB0;C for 30 sec,
55&#xB0;C for 30 sec and 72&#xB0;C for 2 min; and a final extension at 72&#xB0;C for 7 min followed by a hold
at 4&#xB0;C (iCycler; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, U.S.A.). The PCR product was electrophoresed with 1.5%
agarose gel, and the size of the amplification product was determined. Additionally, to
identify the fungal species in the lymph node, the fungal DNA sequence was analyzed. Amplicons
from the lymph node were purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) and sequenced
with the same primer used for amplification (ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer; Applied Biosystems,
Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.). The obtained sequences were identified using BLAST (Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool) on the National Center for Biotechnology Information website
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).</p>
    <p>A histopathological examination showed that a large portion of both nodules was occupied by
an extensive necrotic lesion with severe fibrosis and calcification; both lesions were
considered to be necrotizing granulomatous lesions. A lymph node structure with follicular
hypertrophy was found in the peripheral part of the mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1b and 1c</xref>, white arrowheads); the mass was found to have been the caudal
mediastinal lymph node (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1c</xref>). However, the
original structure of the lymph node was almost entirely lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1c</xref>). A severe infiltration of macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma
cells, neutrophils, eosinophils and multinucleated giant cells of a foreign body type was
around the necrotic foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1d</xref>). Furthermore, the
necrotic foci with inflammatory cell infiltration were surrounded by severe fibrosis.
Eosinophils and multinucleated giant cells dominated in the periphery of the granuloma. Poorly
septate hyphae with a non-uniform width and irregular and wide-angle branching were detected
in the necrotic foci and within the cytoplasm of the multinucleated giant cells. Only a few
hyphae were surrounded by Splendore-Hoeppli material, and no sporulation or conidiation was
observed. No obvious blood vessel invasion was found in the lymph node. The hyphae showed a
positive periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.
1e</xref>) and were stained with Grocott&#x2019;s methenamine silver stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1f</xref>). Furthermore, they were anti-<italic>Rhizopus
arrhizus</italic> monoclonal antibody positive in immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1f</xref>, inset). No acid-fast organisms were seen in the affected lymph
node stained with Ziehl-Neelsen stain. Although follicular hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the
medullary cord were observed in the other mediastinal lymph node, no necrotic foci and no
hyphae were found. Only focal lymphocyte infiltration was found in the proper gastric region
of the abomasum and mild macrophage and eosinophil infiltration was observed in the small
intestine submucosa. However, no hyphae were detected in either of the tissues
histopathologically. In a molecular biological analysis, approximately 600- to 700-base pair
PCR products were amplified from samples of the mediastinal lymph node and abomasum as well as
a previous report [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but were not amplified from
samples of the small intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>PCR detection of fugal DNA in paraffin-embedded tissues with primers TW13 and Ctb6.
Lane M, molecular weight marker; lanes 1, caudal mediastinal lymph node, lane 2,
abomasum; lane 3, small intestine.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-123-g002"/></fig>). However, a full-length sequence was not obtained, and no fungal species with high
homology to the sequence of the product were found. Thus, the steer was diagnosed
histopathologically as having necrotic lymphadenitis with foreign body giant cell infiltration
due to zygomycetes infection, and it is likely that inhibition of eructation by the enlarged
caudal mediastinal lymph node resulted in recurrent ruminal tympany.</p>
    <p>Zygomycetes tend to invade blood vessels, and the infection tends to spread in necrotic or
granulomatous lesions systemically [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition to
the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract could be a main portal of entry for
zygomycetes in cattle subjected to inhalation of spores from moldy feedstuffs [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Zygomycotic lymphadenitis has been found in domestic
animals including cattle and pigs [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In several
earlier studies in cattle, most of the lesions were detected in the mesenteric lymph nodes,
and mediastinal lymphadenitis merely accounted for 7 of 94 [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and 4 of 194 [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] cattle and 9 of 105
[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] lymph nodes with granulomatous mycotic lesions.
These cases were detected in slaughtered cattle, and no detailed information, including age,
clinical condition or pathological findings in other organs, was described. In the present
case, the lesion was confined to the mediastinal lymph node and could have resulted in
clinical ruminal tympany. The caudal mediastinal lymph nodes drain lymph from the pleura, the
lungs, the esophagus, the pericardium, the mediastinum, the diaphragm, the peritoneum, the
liver and the spleen [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and thus, both intrathoracic
and intra-abdominal organs could be the portal of entry of fungi in the lymph node. Meanwhile,
zygomycetes tend to be confined to the lymphatic system in healthy young cattle; granulomatous
lesions have been found only in mediastinal and bronchial lymph nodes in calves aged 4 to 6
months [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Hence, respiratory organs may be the main
portals of entry of fungi in young cattle. In the present case, although no hyphae were
observed in the tissue section of abomasum and the small intestine, fungal DNA was detected in
the affected lymph node and abomasum but not in the small intestine. Therefore, the
possibility of prior infection in the abomasum cannot completely be rejected, even though
hyphae were not seen in the tissue sections. Though, since zygomycetes are members of the
normal rumen flora [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], fungi attached to the abomasal
mucosa may be detected.</p>
    <p>Many cases of zygomycotic lymphadenitis produce no clinical symptoms, and the lesions are
detected incidentally in many cases at slaughter [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In
the present case, the enlarged mediastinal lymph node likely resulted in chronic ruminal
tympany, which suggests that the present case was a rare pathological condition. The
enlargement of the caudal mediastinal lymph node has been reported to be one of the important
causes of chronic ruminal tympany, because the enlarged lymph node may press on the esophagus
or interfere with vagal control of gastric function [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].

</italic>spp.<italic>,</italic> could cause enlargement of the mediastinal lymph node [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although antibiotics, such as penicillin-streptomycin
mixtures, are prescribed for the treatment of unexplained chronic ruminal tympany, these
pathogens do not always respond to treatment [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In
the present case, penicillin was administered after the rumenotomy; however, ruminal tympany
persisted, despite the treatment. Therefore, the response to antibiotic treatment cannot
assist in the diagnosis of unexplained chronic ruminal tympany, so mycotic infection in the
mediastinal lymph node should be considered as a differential diagnosis of chronic ruminal
tympany that is unresponsive to antibiotic treatment.</p>
    <p>Histopathologically, the lesions of mycotic lymphadenitis have been characterized as
amorphous necrosis with calcification, fibrosis and infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages,
lymphocytes and multinucleated giant cells [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The lymphadenitis in the present case was a
necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, and the histopathological features of the lesion were
similar to those in the earlier studies. Additionally, multinucleated giant cell and
eosinophil infiltration was observed dominantly. When filamentous fungi are observed in tissue
sections, a major differentiation must be made among the zygomycetes and other filamentous
fungi, such as <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. and <italic>Candida</italic> spp. [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While zygomycetes produce wide and aseptate hyphae
with wide-angle branching, <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp and <italic>Candida</italic> spp.
present consistently thin hyphae or pseudohyphae that branch at acute angles. Additionally,
sporulation and blastoconidia may be seen in tissues infected with
<italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. and <italic>Candida</italic> spp., respectively [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the present case, the fungal hyphae presented the
morphological features of zygomycetes, such as poor septate, non-uniform width and wide-angle
branching hyphae. In differentiation of mucomycosis and entomophthoramycosis, blood vessel
invasion, thrombosis, tissue necrosis, acute inflammation and dissemination are
characteristically seen in mucomycosis, while these features are not typically observed in
entomophthoramycosis; furthermore, chronic inflammation is generally seen, and phagocytized
hyphae or hyphae surrounded by Splendrore-Hoeppli material can be seen in entomophthoramycosis
[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although the two diseases, mucomycosis and
entomophthoramycosis, present different clinical manifestations in human infections, it is
difficult to differentiate the 2 orders of fungi based on histopathological examination or
epidemiologic background [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the present case, the
histopathological findings included features of both mucormycosis and entomophthoramycosis.
Additionally, the fungal species was not identified, so we used the term &#x201C;zygomycetes&#x201D; in the
diagnosis. In the present case, no fungal species with high homology to the sequence of the
sample were found. Possible causes include a defect in primer or template due to extraction
from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, because a full-length sequence was not
obtained.</p>
    <p>Although the portal of entry of the pathogen was not identified, we showed a case of
tuberculous-like lymphadenitis due to zygomycetes infection in the caudal mediastinal lymph
node of a steer. The clinical and pathological findings in the present case suggest that
zygomycetes infection in the caudal mediastinal lymphadenitis should be considered as a
possible cause of recurrent ruminal tympany.</p>
