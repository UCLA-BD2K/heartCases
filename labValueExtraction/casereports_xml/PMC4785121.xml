  <body>
    <p><italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> is a Gram-negative bacillus and an important zoonotic agent.
Yersiniosis, which is caused by <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic>, occurs in a wide variety of animals and
humans and has a global distribution [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Infection with <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> typically occurs via the oral route and
manifests clinically as enteritis, mesenteric lymphadenitis and, in some cases, septicemia [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Yersiniosis can cause significant mass mortality among zoo animals. Nonhuman primates are
highly susceptible to <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic>, and numerous cases have been reported [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although rodents and birds, especially free-living species, are considered
an important reservoir for <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic>, few cases of yersiniosis have been reported in
these species [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this study,
we report four cases of fatal yersiniosis caused by <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> infection in
captive toucans and a Japanese squirrel.</p>
    <p>In May 2003, a captive female sub-adult Keel-billed toucan (<italic>Ramphastos sulfuratus</italic>) (No. 1) died
suddenly for no apparent reason in a zoological garden in Japan. One week later, another male adult Keel-billed
toucan (No. 2) housed in the same cage exhibited a moribund state and died. In January 2005, a captive female
adult Chestnut-mandibled toucan (<italic>Ramphastos swainsonii</italic>) (No. 3) at another zoological garden
exhibited a moribund state and died. Three months after the death of No. 3, a 2-year-old female Japanese squirrel
(<italic>Sciurus lis</italic>) (No. 4) died of diarrhea in the same zoological garden. All toucans were housed
for a long time in the same outdoor cages and showed good general condition. The Japanese squirrel died under
quarantine in an isolated cage 8 days after it was transported from another zoological garden. The dead squirrel
had low body weight (150 g) compared to other similar-aged squirrels (approximately 220 g). Complete necropsies
were performed on the four animals, and their visceral organs were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin for
histological and immunohistochemical analyses. The tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at
approximately 4 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>m for hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Gram staining. Immunohistochemical analysis
was performed using a commercial rabbit anti-<italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> sera set (O1, O2, O3, O4, O5
and O6) (Denka-Seiken Co., Tokyo, Japan). Bacterial examinations of the livers from No. 1 and No. 2, a cloacal
swab from No. 3 and liver, spleen and intestines from No. 4 were performed as previously described [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
    <p>At necropsy, all three toucans and the Japanese squirrel had enlarged livers and spleens with multifocal fine
white nodules. Many organs, including the spleen, liver and kidneys, were friable, and systemic venous congestion
was observed in the three toucans. There were several fine white nodules in the kidney and fibrin deposition on
the surface of the heart in No. 2. The colon and rectal contents of the Japanese squirrel had high moisture
levels. Microscopically, the nodules in the liver and spleen in the three toucans were areas of focal necrosis
containing large clusters of Gram negative bacilli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>The liver of No. 2. Note the areas of focal necrosis containing central bacterial clusters (arrows).
Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stain.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-78-297-g001"/></fig>). The hepatic sinusoids in the three toucans were filled with numerous bacterial clusters. The intestine,
especially the ileum, showed moderate to severe necrotic enteritis with clusters of Gram negative bacilli
accompanied by lymphocytic infiltration. Additionally, Gram negative bacilli were seen in the heart, lung and
kidney of all the toucans and the cerebrum, thyroid gland, testis and ovary of No. 1 and No. 2. Areas of
hemosiderosis were scattered moderately in the hepatocytes and around the necrotic lesions of the spleen and
intestines of No. 2. In the Japanese squirrel, necrotic lesions, including clusters of Gram negative bacilli in
the liver, spleen, tonsillae and intestine, were observed, similar to those in the toucans. However, compared to
the toucans, the squirrel showed greater neutrophilic infiltration and nuclear debris and smaller bacterial
clusters in the liver and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>The liver of No. 4. Focal necrosis with neutrophilic infiltration. Note the greater neutrophilic

intestine and <italic>Eimeria</italic> sp. infection in the intestinal epithelium of the colon and rectum. The
Gram negative bacilli seen in various tissues showed strong immunolabeling for <italic>Y.

No. 1 and No. 2, <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> 2b was isolated from the cloacal swab of No. 3, and
<italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> 1b was isolated from the liver, spleen and intestine of No. 4.</p>
    <p>All three toucans and the Japanese squirrel had enlarged, friable livers and spleens with multifocal white
nodules. Microscopically, these lesions contained numerous bacterial clusters composed of Gram-negative bacilli
with necrotic lesions. These lesions are typical of yersiniosis caused by <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic>
and have been previously reported in various animal species [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The Gram negative bacilli in the lesions showed strong immunolabeling for
<italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> O4 in No. 1 and No. 2, <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> O2 in No. 3
and <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> O1 in No. 4, and <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> serotypes 4b,
2b or 1b were isolated from the lesions, respectively. On the basis of these findings, it was concluded that the
cause of death was yersiniosis induced by <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> serotype 4b in No. 1 and No. 2,
<italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> serotype 2b in No. 3 and <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> serotype
1b in No. 4. Although the lesions did not differ by bacterial serotype or species in the avian cases, those in the
Japanese squirrel showed greater neutrophilic infiltration and nuclear debris and smaller bacterial clusters.</p>
    <p><italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> has often been isolated from healthy birds and rodents, and free-living
birds and rodents are considered important carriers [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although sporadic cases of fatal yersiniosis have occurred in captive or
wild birds in Europe and the United States [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], cases of avian yersiniosis are extremely rare in Japan, and there are only few reports of
isolation from healthy wild birds [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In Europe and the United States, serotypes 1, 2 or 3 are generally isolated from birds, whereas
serotype 4b is unknown in these countries [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. On the other hand, serotype 4b is a common serotype among humans and other animals in Japan [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The serotype 4b in pathological lesions of No. 1 and No. 2 was not very
different from serotype 2b in lesions of No. 3 in this report or from other serotypes observed in cases of avian
yersiniosis in previous studies. [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, in contrast to the birds in
previous reports, No. 1 and No. 2 with serotype 4b in this report showed bacterial colonies in multiple organs,
including the cerebrum, thyroid gland, testis and ovary. Generally, stress factors, such as cold environment, poor
feeding, immunosuppressive conditions and transport, are contributing factors to precipitating yersiniosis [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the present cases, all three toucans had good nutritive conditions and
died suddenly without any symptoms. The bacterial clusters in these animals were much larger with minimal
inflammatory cellular reaction compared with those observed in mammalian yersiniosis. These findings suggest that
death occurs suddenly with no clinical signs because of rapid bacterial growth before an inflammatory response can
occur. The findings also suggest that toucans have a high sensitivity to <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic>.
Free-living carrier mice were considered as the common source of infection, since the birds died within 1 week of
each other, were housed in the same outdoor cage and showed presence of the same serotype 4b. Similarly, toucan
No. 3 was considered to have acquired the infection from free-living carrier mice via the oral route, because
necrotic lesions with bacilli were observed mainly in the intestine, liver and spleen. On the other hand, Japanese
squirrel No. 4 was highly suspected of having carried <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> before
transportation. Nematode and coccidial infections are believed to be caused by inadequate development (low body
weight), and transportation stress may be strongly associated with the occurrence of yersiniosis. The presence of
nematodes and <italic>Eimeria</italic> sp. in the intestine could have increased the severity of <italic>Y.
pseudotuberculosis</italic> infection in the Japanese squirrel.</p>
    <p>In human patients, a relationship between yersiniosis and iron-overload states, such as hemochromatosis, has been
suggested [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Similar correlations have been reported in the domestic
chicken under experimental conditions [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Yersiniosis occurs less
frequently in avian than in mammalian species, but toucans are highly susceptible to hemochromatosis [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and this may suggest greater susceptibility to <italic>Y.
pseudotuberculosis</italic>. Additionally, correlations between bacterial serotype and pathogenicity are still
unclear in avian species. Further investigations are needed to establish these correlations.</p>
    <p>In this report, we describe four cases of fatal yersiniosis caused by <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> in
three captive toucans (Ramphastidae) and a Japanese squirrel (<italic>Sciurus lis</italic>). To our knowledge,
this is the first report of fatal yersiniosis caused by <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> in a Japanese
squirrel and/or its closely related species in the world as well as in toucans (Ramphastidae) in Japan. Since
sudden death in avian and rodent species may be caused by several important zoonotic diseases, differential
diagnosis using immunohistochemical and bacterial examinations is useful to establish an accurate diagnosis. This
report could provide important information regarding sudden death in captive avian and rodent species.</p>
