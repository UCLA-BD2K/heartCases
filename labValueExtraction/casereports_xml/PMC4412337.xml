        <p>We have shown how the analysis of the angiotomography reconstruction through OsiriX
program has assisted in endovascular perioperative programming. We presented its
application in situations when an unexpected existence of metallic overlapping
artifact (orthopedic osteosynthesis) compromised the adequate visualization of the
arterial lesion during the procedure. Through manipulation upon OsiriX software, with
assistance of preview under virtual fluoroscopy, it was possible to obtain the angles
that would avoid this juxtaposition. These angles were reproduced in the C-arm,
allowing visualization of the occluded segment, reducing the need for repeated image
acquisitions and contrast overload, allowing the continuation of the procedure.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Prior to computed tomography (CT) scans with multichannel detector technology
(implemented only from 1998 - when the first 4-channel equipment became available), the
assessment of peripheral arterial disease by CT scan could only be performed only in a
small segment of vascular system<sup>[<xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. The introduction of multi-slice CT
scans (from 16 channels), allowed the acquisition of larger anatomic volumes<sup>[<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>, making it an accurate method for the
study of peripheral arteries<sup>[<xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.
Although digital subtraction angiography is considered the gold standard for peripheral
arterial assessment, this has been replaced by CT due to the increasing number of
detectors and collimators increasingly thin<sup>[<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. When compared to the first, CT angiography is less invasive,
less expensive and exposes patients to lower doses of radiation<sup>[<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p>
      <p>However, the study of CT angiography generates a massive number of digital data and
unwieldy, which interpretation and discrimination of changes are best evaluated when
post processed in software, such as multi-planar reconstruction, volume rendering and
maximum intensity projection<sup>[<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p>
      <p>We have shown how the analysis of tomographic reconstruction of fine sections through
the OsiriX program has aided in perioperative programming of endovascular abdominal
aneurysms, in prediction of the intra-luminal placement of angiographic catheters and in
correction of angular positioning of the fluoroscopy unit<sup>[<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p>
      <p>We also reported how concepts of angulation and Virtual Fluoroscopy used on OsiriX (from
multichannel CT angiography) are used to obtain the best intraoperative angle of visual
exposure of peripheral artery, in situations where the existence of artifacts (like
metallic orthopedic fixation) compromises its proper visualization during endovascular
procedures.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>Female patient, 24 years old, assisted at the Outpatient Clinic for High Complexity
Endovascular Surgery at University of Campinas, with history of motorcycle trauma (fall)
for 6 months, causing injury with fracture of clavicle, 3rd and 4th left ribs. She
underwent on occasion to an orthopedic surgery (with placement of implantable system for
osteosynthesis - fixation with plate and pins) with no major complications. For 3
months, she developed pain, paresthesia, coldness of the limb and progressive strength
loss, with recent recrudescence. Physical examination presented a preserved sensibility,
decreased motor function and slowed perfusion. The values of segmentar pressures
registered in the left arm through a continuous wave doppler assessment were reduced,
with a brachy-brachial index of 0,55 (N.V.: 0,9-1,1), reinforcing the hypothesis of an
arterial involvement of this territory.</p>
      <p>She underwent CT angiography exam of the supra-aortic trunks and left upper limb. It was
identified an image of interrupted contrast, suggestive of occlusion of left subclavian
artery (near the metallic prosthesis) with refilling in its distal part. The axial
sections had impairment of appropriate visualization of the artery due to streak
artifacts produced by the osteosynthesis, reason why it was opted for the intraoperative
arteriography, for purposes of establishing an exclusive endovascular treatment
(recanalization and covered stent implantation).</p>
      <p>During surgical procedure, there was difficulty in the correct visualization of the
lesion (ie., unfilled portion of the artery by intravascular contrast) due to the
overlapping of radiopaque metallic rod included in the angiographic image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1A</xref>). After some attempts to capture new images
posterior to the angular repositioning of the fluoroscopy unit, it was decided to resort
to auxiliary study of CT in OsiriX software. At first, the manipulation of the axial
images was performed, marking the proximal and distal portions of the subclavian artery
with the <italic>point</italic> tool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1B</xref>).
A three-dimensional volume reconstruction under virtual fluoroscopy was obtained, where
it was able to identify an overlap of this demarcation by the orthopedic prosthesis
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

      <p>By rotational manipulation of three-dimensional image, it was possible to obtain an
angle that would avoid this juxtaposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure
2A</xref>). The angles were reproduced in the C-arm, allowing visualization of the
exposed occluded segment, allowing the rest of the procedure to follow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, we proceeded to the artery
recanalization with coated stent (Gore Viabahn 7x50) which was performed without any
complications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

      <title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Until recently, digital subtraction arteriography was the modality of choice for
evaluating patients with suspected vascular injury. However, due to the wide access of
multichannel exams, it has rapidly replaced the conventional angiography in the
diagnosis of vascular trauma<sup>[<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p>
      <p>In a meta-analysis by Jens et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>
sensitivity and specificity for vascular injury (when compared to subtraction
arteriography or surgery) was 99.2% and 96.2% respectively. This justifies why all
service centers should have a trauma tomography as an accurate method for diagnosis of
vascular injury in extremity trauma, by reserving the conventional angiography for
interventional or when the first is inconclusive.</p>
      <p>Vascular abnormalities in the upper limbs are found less frequently than those affecting
the lower extremities. Arterial imaging studies of the upper limbs is usually performed
in trauma victims with ischemic symptoms of upper extremities, prep planning of complex
vascular reconstructions and dialysis access as well as follow up of endovascular or
surgical procedures<sup>[<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p>
      <p>Despite the many advantages, CT angiography also has its limitations. It can be
ineffective in the diagnosis if the contrast reaches the studied segment too soon or too
late at the period of image acquisition by the device. Another scenario in the diagnosis
of arterial lesions after trauma is the presence of artifacts caused by metallic
fragments on the periphery of the vessel, such as projectiles from firearms. These
streaks make it impossible to analyze the correct image<sup>[<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p>
      <p>Anyway, it is important to remember that in any tomographic analysis is necessary to
review the images of axial views to confirm the findings presented in reconstructions
and define the possible presence of these or other artifacts that simulate
disease<sup>[<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p>
      <p>In our case the analysis of the image in axial views showed these streaks artifacts,
compromising the injury extension evaluation, even after adjusted values of windowing
(brightness and contrast). Therefore it was decided to supplement with subtraction
arteriography intraoperatively. Thus, it would be possible to estimate, based on the gap
of intravascular contrast fill of the left subclavian artery, the extent of the lesion,
the size and required length of the stent(covered stent graft).</p>
      <p>However when facing the radiopaque image produced by the orthopedic fixation of the
clavicle, it prevented the perfect view of the angiographic image due to its overlapping
and radiopacity. To continue with the procedure without visualization of the arterial
segment with intravascular contrast refill would increase risk of false paths, extensive
dissections and the failure of the intervention.</p>
      <p>We used the angiotomography previously performed in attempt to simulate the optimum
viewing angle of the occluded segment to be recanalyzed. The OsiriX point tool marks
permanently a voxel from a three-dimensional image - which is defined as the
representation of a pixel (the smallest point of a digital image) in a volumetric grid
originated from a series of pictures - and is reproduced in a
three-dimensional-by-volume reconstruction. Doing so, it's possible to obtain any
information of spatial positioning of this mark, such as the path of the occluded
subclavian artery in this case. Thus, when marking with points the trajectory of the
artery, it was possible to visualize it in any sort of reconstruction, axial,
three-dimensional-by-volume or multiplanar. Through rotational manipulation of the
three-dimensional-by-volume image, we could illustrate the studied artery avoiding
overlapping the osteosynthesis plaque. The angles obtained automatically from the
software were reproduced in the fluoroscopy unit, allowing the correct visualization of
the angiographic image. Thereafter, it was possible to reduce the need for repeated
angiographic takes in attempt to obtain the best exposure of the artery, avoiding
iodinated contrast overload. Therefore we proceeded to the recanalization of the
thrombosed segment with placement of a covered stent with therapeutic success (which can
be observed by control angiography). The patient's clinical improvement was evident,
verified with the complete resolution of the symptoms.</p>
      <p>The use of OsiriX as a complementary tool allows doctors to assist in the preparation of
surgeries (as endovascular) extending it beyond the field of diagnostic radiology. These
tasks can be easily incorporated into the armamentarium of the surgeon to avoid pitfalls
and unforeseen situations that are identified intraoperatively, increasing the operatory
risk and oftentimes leading to intervention failure.</p>
