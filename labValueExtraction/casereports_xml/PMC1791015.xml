      <abstract>
        <p><italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>, commonly known as Group B streptococcus (GBS), was originally discovered as a cause of bovine mastitis. GBS colonizes the genital tract of up to 40% of women and has become a major pathogen in neonatal meningitis. GBS endocarditis is thought to be an uncommon manifestation of this infection and carries a higher mortality compared to other streptococcal pathogens. Studies have shown that endocarditis after abortion has an incidence of about one per million. However, this figure was published prior to routine use of echocardiography for diagnosis. The American Heart Association has recently declared transesophageal echocardiography the gold standard for endocarditis diagnosis. This case report illustrates that, given the potentially devastating consequences of endocarditis, there is a need for updated studies to adequately assess the true incidence of this infection. Pending the outcome of these studies, routine GBS screening and prophylactic antibiotics prior to abortion should be recommended.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p><italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>, commonly known as Group B
streptococcus (GBS), is a gram-positive coccus and only member of
Lancefield group B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Originally discovered as a cause of bovine mastitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], it is now a major pathogen in neonatal meningitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and locally invasive as well as serious systemic infections in patients with chronic diseases. GBS
endocarditis is thought to be an uncommon manifestation of this
infection and is known to carry a higher mortality compared to
other streptococcal pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>We report a case of a previously healthy young woman, who
developed GBS tricuspid valve endocarditis after an elective
termination of pregnancy. This case exemplifies the need for
strict preoperative antibiotic use for abortions during the second
trimester and beyond. It also illuminates our reliance on outdated
case reports that have historically stated that the rate of
endocarditis after abortion is not high enough to warrant
preoperative antibiotics prior to the second trimester. We feel it
is time to revisit the issue of whether all women should be
screened for GBS infection and if positive receive appropriate
antibiotics prior to abortions.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 22-year-old female with two prior full-term deliveries underwent
an elective abortion at 15 weeks gestation at a clinic, 8 weeks
prior to admission at our medical center. The procedure was
uncomplicated; the patient does not remember receiving antibiotics
or being tested for GBS. Her past medical history was
noncontributory although she reports a negative HIV test one month
prior to admission. She denies using illicit drugs, any injection
therapy, or any recent tattoos.</p>
      <p>One week after the abortion, she developed low-grade fever and
malaise and returned for a repeat cervical dilation and uterine
evacuation. Genital cultures grew GBS, <italic>Candida albicans</italic>,
and oxacillin-sensitive <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. She was
discharged with 7 days of amoxicillin.</p>
      <p>Two weeks later, she presented to another hospital complaining of
fever, chills, productive cough, dyspnea, and diffuse chest pain
of 5 days duration. She was febrile with enlarged tonsils, no
evidence of cardiac abnormalities, rales in bilateral lung bases,
and a benign abdomen. A sterile speculum exam revealed
yellow-green discharge from the cervix; cultures were sent. She
was admitted and treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and
metronidazole. CT showed diffuse, patchy infiltrates in the lower
lobes with cavitations and no evidence of a pulmonary embolism.
Blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci in chains presumed to be
<italic>S pneumonia</italic> and nafcillin was added. She left against
medical advice and two weeks later presented to our Emergency
Department (ED) with worsening fevers, chills, SOB, productive
cough, and pleuritic chest pain. In the ED, she was again treated
with cefotaxime and azithromycin for presumed community acquired
pneumonia and intravenous heparin for possible PE.</p>
      <p>On exam she was febrile, hypotensive, tachycardic, and tachypneic.
Oxygen saturation was 87% on room air. She had pale
conjunctivae and dry mucous membranes. Lung exam revealed diffuse
rhonchi and decreased breath sounds on the right. On
cardiovascular exam, her neck showed cannon <italic>v</italic> waves along with a
3/6 holosystolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternal
border. Abdominal and extremity exams were benign. There were no
signs of Osler's nodes or Janeway lesions.</p>
      <p>Her CBC revealed a WBC of 19.3, hemoglobin of 9.6, and platelets
of 81 000. D-dimer was 4540 ng/mL; beta hCG was negative. Chest
radiograph showed bilateral, fluffy, lower lobe infiltrates with
peripheral cavitations. Ultrasound of the lower extremities for
deep vein thromboses was negative. EKG revealed sinus tachycardia
and right ventricular conduction delay (RSR'). CT of the chest,
abdomen, and pelvis revealed large, bilateral, peripheral lower
lobe cavitary lesions.</p>
      <p>She was admitted to the ICU and treated with penicillin G,
gentamicin, and clindamycin. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures of 55 mmHg,
right atrial and right ventricular dilation, and large tricuspid
valve vegetation with severe tricuspid regurgitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).
Left ventricular ejection fraction was
56%.</p>
      <p>Blood cultures were reported positive in 12 hours with GBS,
sensitive to penicillin (MIC 0.12) and cefotaxime (MIC 0.12).
Clindamycin was stopped.</p>
      <p>Throughout her stay, the patient was persistently febrile. Repeat
CT of the chest, 2 weeks after admission, showed improving
pulmonary infiltrates; multiple, bilateral cavitary lesions
increased in size; cardiomegaly with a very large right atrium and
suprahepatic inferior vena cava, along with a severely enlarged
liver suggesting right heart failure.</p>
      <p>She was treated with 3 weeks of gentamicin and discharged on
continued intravenous penicillin G for a total of 6 weeks of
therapy. Although her echocardiograms and CT scans showed evidence
of right heart failure, she had no clinical evidence of this; it
was decided to monitor the patient closely and forgo surgery. The
patient missed two followup appointments after her discharge.</p>
      <p>She appeared in the ED a few months later complaining of chest
pain and dyspnea on exertion. CT scan of chest showed left
descending pulmonary artery aneurysm without clot or dissection
but clear evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Echocardiogram in
the ED revealed normal LV motion and ejection fraction, complete
resolution of the vegetation, pulmonary artery peak systolic
pressure of 41 mmHg, a thickened tricuspid valve with severe
regurgitation, and septal flattening consistent with right
ventricular volume overload. The cardiologist evaluated the
patient and recommended her to followup for a possible tricuspid
valve replacement. However, the patient was again lost to followup.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Studies have reported rates of GBS colonization in pregnant women
of 4.6% to 40.6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Fifty percent of
colonized mothers transmit GBS to their newborns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. For this reason penicillin is routinely recommended during delivery
for women colonized with GBS. The incidence of maternal
complications from GBS colonization is less well described. In
general it has been reported to cause benign infections such as
urinary tract infections. Previously reported serious maternal
complications due to GBS include chorioamnionitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and endometritis, which occur more after cesarean sections than
vaginal deliveries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>According to a 1973 often-cited article, the incidence of GBS
endocarditis following obstetric or gynecological procedures is
low, ranging from 0.03 to 0.14 per 1 000 deliveries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].
Seaworth and Durack's 1986 article provides us with the most up to
date estimation of the incidence of infective endocarditis after
abortion: about one per million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The pathogenesis of GBS endocarditis is presumed to be bacteremia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] following manipulation of the genital tract colonized with GBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In one small study of only 20 patients, bacteremia following routine dilation and curettage occurred in 5% (1 out of 20 patients);
the bacterium isolated was <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. There is a paucity of current studies examining this topic. In the nearly twenty years since Seaworth and Durack's 1986
article, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has proven itself
to be superior to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). One of the
early studies examining TEE versus TTE was in 1991. It was felt
that TEE represented &#x201C;a significant advance over transthoracic
echocardiography,&#x201D; as TEE had twice the sensitivity of TTE
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The 2005 American Heart Association Guidelines on endocarditis state that &#x201C;[TEE] is the preferred imaging technique
for the diagnosis &#x2026; of infective endocarditis (IE) in
adults with either high risk for IE or moderate-to-high clinical
suspicion of IE of in patients in whom imaging by [TTE] is
difficult&#x201D; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. There is a great chance that Seaworth and Durack&#x2014;relying upon what would today be considered incomplete, if not outdated, standards&#x2014;missed cases of endocarditis that
could today be diagnosed with TEE. It is also important to note
that their data looked at cases from 1940 through 1983 and that
echocardiography was not in their diagnostic criteria. They also
relied upon published case reports in their estimation of the
incidence of endocarditis after abortion being about 1 in 1
million. Because the women undergoing abortions are usually
younger and have a high potential to be lost to follow up, this is
an important issue to revisit.</p>
      <p>Mortality from endocarditis still ranges from 20% to 25%,
down from the 35% to 40% reported from the 1960s. The
decrease is likely due to earlier detection and improved medical
and surgical therapies. However, the numerous potential serious
complications of infective endocarditis serve as an important
reminder of the significant morbidity associated with this
infection. Septic emboli cause the majority of these
complications, including but not limited to septic pulmonary
emboli, cerebral vascular accidents, renal failure, and myocardial
infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Other complications include congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, abscess formation&#x2014;both in the heart and as
a consequence of septic emboli elsewhere, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, and meningitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="further questions">
      <title>FURTHER QUESTIONS</title>
      <p>Given the morbidity and mortality related to endocarditis and the
relatively easy and cheap preoperative regimen, should all women
be screened for GBS and, if positive, given antibiotics prior to
all elective abortions? Certainly, all women at risk&#x2014;those with
prosthetic heart valves, known MVP, or other risk factors&#x2014;should
be tested for GBS and given endocarditis prophylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, what to do with women colonized with GBS and undergoing
abortions (especially first trimester) has not been discussed
since the advent of new technology. Current treatment guidelines
are based upon old literature that must be updated. Information
regarding rates of bacteremia after abortion, rates of
endocarditis after women colonized with GBS undergo abortion, and
better morbidity and mortality data must be sought before the
current guidelines can be safely relied upon. Prospective studies
are warranted in order to have a more accurate estimate of the
rate of endocarditis after abortion, utilizing the new guidelines
of endocarditis diagnosis.</p>
