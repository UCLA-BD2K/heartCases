      <abstract>
        <p>High frequencies of cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors (CTLp) recognizing HIV-1 laboratory  strain gene products have been detected in adults within weeks of primary infection. In contrast, HIV-1&#x2013;specific CTLp are uncommonly detected in infants younger than 6 mo. To address the hypothesis that the use of target cells expressing laboratory strain <italic>env</italic> gene products  might limit the detection of HIV-1 env-specific CTLp in early infancy, recombinant vaccinia  vectors (vv) expressing HIV-1 <italic>env</italic> genes from early isolates of four vertically infected infants  were generated. The frequencies of CTLp recognizing target cells infected with vv-expressing  <italic>env</italic> gene products from early isolates and HIV-1 IIIB were serially measured using limiting dilution followed by in vitro stimulation with mAb to CD3. In one infant, the detection of early  isolate env-specific CTLp preceded the detection of IIIB-specific CTLp. CTLp recognizing  HIV-1 IIIB and infant isolate <italic>env</italic> were detected by 6 mo of age in two infants. In a fourth infant, HIV-1 IIIB <italic>env</italic> and early isolate <italic>env</italic>-specific CTLp were simultaneously detected at 12 mo of  age. These results provide evidence that young infants can generate HIV-1&#x2013;specific CTL responses and provide support for the concept of neonatal vaccination to prevent HIV-1 transmission. However, the early predominance of type-specific CTL detected in some young infants suggests that the use of vaccines based on laboratory strains of HIV-1 may not protect  against vertical infection.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The vertical transmission of HIV-1 from an infected  woman to her infant is the predominant mode of pediatric infection. Prospective studies estimate the rate of  vertical transmission to be 14&#x2013;40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Vertical HIV-1 transmission can occur in utero, during delivery (intrapartum), or  after birth through breastfeeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In nonbreastfed populations, 45&#x2013;70% of vertical infections occur in the intrapartum period. In developing countries, where breastfeeding is  necessary and encouraged, up to 75% of infants may be infected at or after delivery.</p>
    <p>In recent years, the incidence of vertical HIV-1 transmission has sharply increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) resulting in an urgent need  to develop effective strategies to prevent vertical HIV-1  infection. Although the administration of zidovudine to  mother&#x2013;infant pairs has been shown to reduce significantly  the risk of vertical HIV-1 transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), the cost and intensity of the regimen render it impractical for use in developing nations, where most pediatric infections occur.  Additionally, perinatal antiretroviral therapy would not prevent the vertical transmission of HIV-1 through breastfeeding beyond the neonatal period. A safe and effective active/ passive vaccine regimen, begun at birth, therefore would  be a more attractive strategy. Better understanding of the  pathogenesis of vertical HIV-1 infection and the capability  of the young human infant to generate HIV-1&#x2013;specific immune responses is crucial for the development of a vaccine  to prevent vertical HIV-1 infection.</p>
    <p>We and others have previously reported that HIV-1&#x2013;specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors (CTLp)<sup>1</sup> are uncommonly detected in early infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Viral genotype/ phenotype, early viral load, host genotype, timing of infection, and history of prior infections appear to be important  factors in the generation of virus-specific CTL responses.  Two lines of evidence suggested to us that the use of labstrain vaccinia vectors (vv) to detect HIV-1&#x2013;specific CTL  might underestimate the CTL repertoire in early infancy.  First, analysis of vertically transmitted HIV-1 env sequences  suggests that limited viral genotypes are transmitted or amplified after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Second, Selin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) have reported higher frequencies of lymphocytic choriomeningitis  (LCMV)&#x2013;specific CTLp in animals who have experienced  prior heterologous viral infections than in immunologically  naive animals. Therefore, we hypothesized that type-specific responses might predominate in early infancy and that  the use of target cells expressing laboratory isolate gene products might limit the detection of HIV-1 env-specific CTLp  in early infancy.</p>
    <p>To address this hypothesis, HIV-1 <italic>env</italic> genes from early  isolates of four vertically infected infants were PCR amplified, cloned, and used to generate recombinant vv. CTLp  frequencies recognizing target cells infected with vv-expressing env gene products from early isolates and HIV-1 IIIB  were serially measured from early to late infancy using limiting dilution followed by in vitro stimulation with mAb to  CD3; split-well analysis allowed the evaluation of crossreactivity of detected CTLp. In one infant, the detection of  CTLp recognizing target cells expressing early isolate <italic>env</italic>  preceded the detection of CTLp recognizing target cells  expressing IIIB env. These type-specific CTLp detected in  early infancy were later replaced by cross-reactive groupspecific CTL. Cross-reactive <italic>env</italic>-specific CTLp recognizing  HIV-1 IIIB and infant isolate <italic>env</italic> were detected by 6 mo of  age in two infants. In a fourth infant, CTLp recognizing  target cells infected with HIV-1 IIIB <italic>env</italic> and early isolate  <italic>env</italic> were simultaneously detected at 12 mo of age. Implications for neonatal HIV-1 vaccine development are discussed.</p>

        <p>Four infants with defined timing of infection and  previously characterized CTL responses to HIV-1 IIIB env (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>)  were chosen for these studies. HIV-1 culture and DNA PCR  were positive in blood specimens obtained at birth and in all subsequent specimens from two infants (VI-05 and VI-06), suggesting in utero infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). HIV-1 culture and DNA PCR were  negative on specimens obtained from two other infants (VI-08  and VI-11) at birth but were positive by 1 mo of age, suggesting  late in utero or intrapartum infection. None of the infants were  on antiretroviral therapy at the time that isolates were obtained  for use in the preparation of vv constructs.</p>
        <p>HIV-1 IIIB <italic>env</italic>-specific CTLp were previously detected in  blood samples obtained during early infancy from only 1 (VI-06)  of the 4 infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). HIV-1 CTLp were detected in cord blood  and subsequent specimens from VI-06. HIV-1 gag-specific CTLp  were detected as early as 3 mo of age in VI-11; <italic>env</italic>-specific CTLp  were not detected through 12 mo of age. In VI-05 and VI-08,  HIV-1 <italic>env</italic>-specific CTLp were not detected until 10&#x2013;11 mo of  age. Human Studies Committee approval and individual informed consent from the guardian of each infant were obtained  before we conducted these studies. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> summarizes sequential  measures of peripheral blood HIV-1 load and CD4 counts of each  infant studied as well as the ages at which <italic>env</italic> genes were amplified from infant viral isolates for cloning and insertion into vv. </p>

        <p>The entire 2.6kb coding region of env was PCR amplified from proviral DNA  at each of two early timepoints (first and 3&#x2013;6-mo isolates) from  each patient; the PCR product was gel purified with Eluquick  (Schleicher &amp; Schuell, Keene, NH) and ligated to the plasmid  vector pCR3 (InVitrogen, San Diego, CA). After ligation, the  reaction mixture was introduced into TOP10F&#x2032; cells by CaCl<sub>2</sub>  transformation. Cells were plated on LB&#x2013;carbenicillin agar plates  and incubated overnight at 37&#xB0;C; selected colonies were then expanded in 3-ml cultures containing LB&#x2013;ampicillin overnight at  37&#xB0;C. Clones with inserts of appropriate size, as judged by restriction enzyme digestion, were sequenced at the SP6 or T7 promoter sites within pCR3 adjacent to the insert to determine orientation using the Sequenase Version 2.0 sequencing kit (United  States Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH). Clones were then grouped  according to digestion patterns obtained with StuI, AvaI, BamHI,  KpnI BglI, and HindIII and a predominant clone was selected  from each timepoint for subcloning (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). </p>
        <p>The predominant clone from each timepoint was digested  with BamHI and XhoI and ligated into the BamHI&#x2013;XhoI site of  pAbT4587A (created by the addition of an XhoI site within the  pAbT4587 vector provided by Therion Biologics, Cambridge,  MA).

To minimize potential variability in assay conditions  and to allow comparison of results between the timepoints studied for each infant, all limiting dilution cultures for each infant  were set up and all CTLp assays were performed at the same time  and with the same reagents.

Examination of sequences through the V3  loops suggested relative homogeneity of first isolates (data  not shown). Divergence in nucleotide sequence between  HIV-1 IIIB and individual infant isolate env was then estimated using heteroduplex tracking assays and sequencing.

Sequence comparisons of a 946-bp region spanning V1 to V3 indicate  that IIIB and MN env differ from each other by 8.3%,  whereas IIIB and p08-6-20D differ by &#x223C;10%. Therefore,  the degree of heterogeneity between individual infant isolate and IIIB env sequences is between 8&#x2013;10%. </p>

        <title>The Generation of Recombinant vv from Early Infant Viral  Isolates.</title>
        <p>The entire 2.6-kb coding region of env was amplified from proviral DNA at two early timepoints (and first  3&#x2013;6-mo isolates) from each infant, ligated into pCR3 (InVitrogen), and digested with StuI, AvaI, BamHI, KpnI,  BglI, and HindIII. One to four distinct patterns of restriction digests were obtained from each set of clones derived  from virus from each patient at a single timepoint and were  designated as groups A, B, C, and D. The group containing  the largest number of clones was considered to be the predominant group and one clone was then chosen from each  predominant group for subcloning (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The instability of the <italic>env</italic> gene from the viral isolate of patient VI-06 at  6 mo of age in pAbT4587A prevented its subcloning.  Therefore, only one <italic>env</italic> subclone, from 1 d of age, was derived from virus of infant VI-06.</p>
        <p>The gel isolation of multiple <italic>env</italic> genes for subcloning  could potentially result in contamination of one <italic>env</italic> gene  with another. Heteroduplex analysis was employed to ascertain whether the subcloned <italic>envs</italic> were identical to the  original clone from which they were derived. Absence of  contaminating <italic>env</italic> sequences was shown by the lack of heteroduplex formation between cloned env fragments and  their identical subclone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In addition, env coding sequences from pNL4-3, a molecular clone used frequently  in our laboratory, were also used to form heteroduplexes  with the env clones derived from infant viral isolates to ensure that none contained the pNL4-3 env sequence. The  formation of heteroduplexes of varying mobility between  pNL4-3 and the cloned env fragments further verified lack  of contamination and demonstrated that each of the env  clones was unique. </p>

        <p>HIV-1 env-specific CTLp detected in VI-11 in early infancy exclusively recognized early infant isolate env, whereas  HIV-1&#x2013;specific CTLp detected in later infancy were primarily cross-reactive. In VI-06 and VI-08, cross-reactive  CTLp recognizing early infant isolate and IIIB env were  detected as early as 6 and 4 mo of age, respectively. At 6  mo of age, only CTLp recognizing target cells infected with  vv expressing the 20-d isolate were detected in VI-08, while  cross-reactive CTLp were detected again at 19 mo. Since  virus-independent in vitro stimulation was used to expand  CTLp, the CTLp frequencies detected are likely reflective  of the CTLp frequencies in vivo. However, at the relatively  low CTLp frequencies detected at 6 mo, sampling error  might explain the sole detection of type-specific CTLp.</p>

        <title>HIV-1-specific CTLp Activity Detected in Early Infancy Is  CD8 T Cell Mediated.</title>
        <p>HIV-1 env-specific cytolysis may be  CD8 T cell mediated and HLA class I&#x2013;restricted or NK  cell&#x2013;mediated cytolysis through ADCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Unfortunately, the limited PBMC repository available from early  infancy precluded the use of CD4, CD8, or NK-depleted  PBMC populations in the limiting dilution assays. To determine the phenotype of the effector cells in the limiting  dilution assays, we performed limiting dilution assays in  which a bispecific (anti-CD3, CD8) mAb was used instead  of mAb to CD3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Use of this antibody led to the depletion of CD8 T cells from the LDA wells (&lt;1% CD8 T cells  compared with 45% CD8 T cells in the wells treated with  mAb to CD3 alone) and a 55&#x2013;90% reduction in env-specific CTLp frequency compared with wells treated with mAb  to CD3 alone. These studies suggest that the env-specific  CTLp detected in the assays were mediated by CD8 T cells.</p>

        <title>Detection of HIV-1 Env-specific CTLp in Early Vertical Infection, Viral Load, and Clinical Disease Progression.</title>
        <p>In three infants,  HIV-1&#x2013;specific CTL recognizing early infant isolate gene  products were detected before 6 mo of age. Infant VI-11,  in whom HIV-1 gag- and early isolate env-specific CTL  were detected by 3 mo of age, has remained only mildly  symptomatic without evidence of immune suppression  (CDC A1; reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) at 3 yr of age. However, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), infant VI-06 experienced a rapid increase in viral load and a rapid decline in peripheral blood  CD4 T cell numbers after birth despite the detection of  HIV-1 gag- and env-specific CTL in cord blood and 3-wk  specimens. While env-specific CTLp were detected in infant VI-08 by 4 mo of age, this infant developed HIV-1  encephalopathy and severe CD4 depletion (CDC C3) by 3  yr of age. The early detection of HIV-1 env-specific CTLp  in the latter two infants suggest that HIV-1&#x2013;specific CTL  alone may not protect against CD4 depletion or disease progression.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In assays using target cells expressing laboratory strain HIV-1  gene products, HIV-1&#x2013;specific CTLp have been uncommonly detected in early infancy. This study addressed the  hypothesis that type-specific responses might predominate  in early infancy and that the use of target cells expressing  laboratory isolate gene products might limit the detection  of HIV-1&#x2013;specific CTL in early infancy. To address this  hypothesis, HIV-1 <italic>env</italic> genes from early isolates of four vertically infected infants were PCR amplified, cloned, and  used to generate recombinant vv. The frequencies of CTLp  recognizing target cells infected with vv-expressing <italic>env</italic>  gene products from early isolates and HIV-1 IIIB were serially measured from early to late infancy using limiting dilution followed by in vitro stimulation with mAb to CD3.  HIV-1&#x2013;specific CTLp were detected before 6 mo of age in  three infants. In one infant, the detection of CTLp recognizing target cells expressing early isolate <italic>env</italic> preceded the  detection of CTLp recognizing target cells expressing IIIB  env; these type-specific CTLp detected in early infancy  were later replaced by cross-reactive group-specific CTL. In  two other infants, early group-specific responses were detected. In a fourth infant, CTLp recognizing target cells infected with HIV-1 IIIB env and early isolate env were simultaneously detected at 12 mo of age. These results reconfirm  that young infants can generate HIV-1&#x2013;specific CTL responses and provide support for the concept of perinatal  vaccination to prevent HIV-1 transmission.</p>
      <p>The generation of vv-expressing infecting strain gene products was central to our studies. To minimize the chance of  amplifying defective HIV-1 env sequences, we chose to  use <italic>env</italic> genes amplified from cultured virus to construct the  env-expressing recombinant vv. Whereas several studies have  demonstrated the outgrowth of variant strains of limited diversity in viral coculture that did not predominate in vivo  at the timepoint at which the culture was established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), several lines of evidence suggest that the isolates used  were representative of the in vivo population of viruses.  First, studies that have compared the selection of variants in  culture to those present in vivo have maintained these viral  cultures up to at least 28 d. The <italic>env</italic> genes used to generate  recombinant vv in our studies were amplified from minimally passaged virus cultured for less than 1 wk. Second,  the absence of anti-retroviral therapy in these patients at  each of the timepoints from which the env vaccinia recombinants were generated supports the notion that these variants were not suppressed in vivo and expanded in vitro in  the absence of drug. Third, the ability of CTL precursors  from these patients to recognize env protein products from  the env sequences derived from cultured virus suggests that  these sequences were present in vivo.</p>
      <p>Minimal diversity in env sequences of HIV-1 strains isolated from adults and infants early in primary infection has  been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Although HIV-1&#x2013;specific CTL  expand in response to a homogeneous population of variants in both populations of infected individuals, group-specific CTL appear to be detected more commonly in adult  primary infection than in vertical primary infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Therefore, the type specificity of early infant CTL responses is not likely due to a homogeneous starting population of virus.</p>
      <p>Adults possess memory CTL that may cross-react with  HIV-1 proteins and expand in response to HIV-1 infection  in concert with antigen-naive CTL precursors. CTL expansion upon acute HIV-1 infection in adults may be similar to that observed by Selin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) in mice. They observed that acute Pichinde virus infection in LCMV  immune mice resulted in expansion of CTL that were  cross-reactive with both LCMV and Pichinde virus. Crossreactive memory CTL originally expanded in response to a  previous non&#x2013;HIV-1 antigenic encounter may possess  TCRs with lower affinity for HIV-1 antigen. A lower affinity interaction may allow for a greater degree of promiscuity in recognition of epitopes of HIV-1 gene products on  various HIV-1 strains. The group-specific CTL responses  detected in infected adults during or shortly after seroconversion may be due in part to the contribution of this expanded non&#x2013;HIV-1&#x2013;specific memory pool of CTL.</p>
      <p>In contrast, HIV-1 infection occurs in infants whose immune systems have not been primed by previous antigenic  exposure. Therefore, potentially cross-reactive memory  CTL may not exist. Diversification of the viral variant population over time may eventually result in the expansion of  CTLp populations recognizing a greater number of viral  epitopes with the concomitant ability to recognize these  epitopes on more than one strain of HIV-1.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, type-specific responses detected in some  young HIV-1 vertically infected infants may be due to partial tolerance. Vertical HIV-1 infection occurs at a time  when the cellular immune system is being vigorously edited on the basis of its ability to discriminate between self  and nonself. HIV-1 antigen may be viewed as self-antigen  during this process and HIV-1&#x2013;reactive CTL may be deleted or anergized. The ability of HIV-1 to infect and replicate within professional antigen presenting cells such as  macrophages and its presence on dendritic cells may allow  for activation of a small population of HIV-1&#x2013;reactive CTL  that escape tolerance induction. This partial break in tolerance may originally be directed at a limited array of viral  epitopes, resulting in a type-specific CTL response. Recognition of these initial epitopes by CTL may lead to an expansion of CTL responsiveness in which a progressively  greater number of viral epitopes may be recognized. Expansion in epitope recognition may subsequently result from  the phenomenon of epitope spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) in concert with  a diversification of HIV-1 variants toward viral gene products whose sequences bear less resemblance to the original  tolerizing variants. The group-specific CTL responses detected by 12 mo of age may evolve in this manner.</p>
      <p>In summary, our studies indicate that young infants are  capable of generating virus-specific CTL in response to viral  infection and some support the development of a neonatal  HIV-1 vaccine. However, the detection of type-specific  immunity in some young infants suggests that a vaccine  based upon laboratory strains of HIV-1 may not be protective. For optimal efficacy, it will likely be necessary to use  gene products from viral strains isolated from patients in  targeted geographical regions as immunogens.</p>
