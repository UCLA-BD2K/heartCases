No property was determined when chronic diseases of our patient, drugs used and history of surgery was questioned. It was learned that the purpose of slimming diet rich in fiber has been made for 10 days. Increase in bowel sounds on auscultation in the upper quadrant of the abdomen, while there was a decrease in the lower quadrant. The patient's vital signs were normal with normal laboratory values. Nasogastric tube was inserted in patients with vomiting, abdominal distension and constipation. There were air and liquid levels in the intestine in her direct abdominal radiographs, there was severely distended stomach and the gastric lumen had been filling with opacities (A).
