      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Leptospirosis, a zoonotic infection and dengue, an arthropod born viral infection, are endemic in countries with humid subtropical or tropical climates and have epidemic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Both these infections have emerged as major public health problem in Sri Lanka in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Recently, Sri Lanka has experienced a string of widespread dengue epidemics annually which has now become a hyperendemic with frequent reports of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>The incidence of both these diseases peaks during monsoons and both diseases present with similar clinical manifestations making differentiation of leptospirosis from dengue difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

      <title>Case presentation</title>
      <p>A 52&#xA0;year old previously healthy Sri Lankan male was admitted to our facility with a history of fever for 4&#xA0;days associated with headache, abdominal pain, generalized myalgia and reduced urine output. On admission he was febrile, rational and nonicteric, with a blood pressure of 90/60&#xA0;mmHg, pulse of 118 beats/min, breathing frequency of 22/min and oxygen saturation of 97&#xA0;% on room air. The liver was tender and palpable 3&#xA0;cm below the right costal margin. He did not have clinical evidence of pneumonitis, pleural effusion, ascites. Laboratory investigations on admission showed thrombocytopenia with normal white cell count and increased levels of blood urea, serum creatinine, liver transaminases, prothombin time, creatinine phosphokinase and trophonin I. Both IgG and IgM dengue antibody tests were positive indicating recent dengue infection. Serological tests for leptospirosis (microscopic agglutination test) was negative. The investigation results are summarized in Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Despite adequate fluid resuscitation, the patient remained hypotensive and he was started on inotropes and vasopressors. He was started on ceftriaxone and transferred to an intensive care unit where haemodialysis was started due to worsening acidaemia and fluid overload. On the second day, he developed haemoptysis and chest X ray showed evidence of diffuse bilateral alveolar haemorrhages. Arterial blood gas analysis showed type 1 respiratory failure. As the patient was in severe respiratory distress, he was placed on mechanical ventilation. Later his condition was further complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation. Leptospirosis serology was repeated on day 7 and it showed a rising titre of 3,600, indicating recent leptospirosis infection. Despite aggressive management of septic shock, oliguric acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation, the patient succumbed to his illness on the eighth day of admission.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#xA0;1</label><caption><p>Laboratory investigations of case presentation</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Days from admission</th><th align="left">Day 1</th><th align="left">Day 3</th><th align="left">Day 5</th><th align="left">Day 8</th><th align="left">Reference value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Haemoglobin (g/L)</td><td align="left">11.4</td><td align="left">11.3</td><td align="left">7.3</td><td align="left">9.1</td><td char="&#x2013;" align="char">13&#x2013;16</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Haematocrit (%)</td><td align="left">32.8</td><td align="left">32.6</td><td align="left">24.6</td><td align="left">28.3</td><td char="&#x2013;" align="char">40&#x2013;50</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Platelets (&#xD7;10<sup>9</sup>/L)</td><td align="left">23</td><td align="left">9</td><td align="left">36</td><td align="left">121</td><td char="&#x2013;" align="char">150&#x2013;450</td></tr><tr><td align="left">White blood cells (&#xD7;10<sup>9</sup>/L)</td><td align="left">8.7</td><td align="left">16.8</td><td align="left">23.1</td><td align="left">28.6</td><td char="&#x2013;" align="char">4,000&#x2013;10,000</td></tr><tr><td align="left">CPK (u/L)</td><td align="left">1,180</td><td align="left">1,790</td><td align="left">809</td><td align="left">&#x2013;</td><td char="&#x2013;" align="char">25&#x2013;174</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Serum creatinine (&#xB5;mol/L)</td><td align="left">288</td><td align="left">405</td><td align="left">378</td><td align="left">426</td><td char="&#x2013;" align="char">0.6&#x2013;1.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Blood urea (mmol/L)</td><td align="left"/><td align="left">28.9</td><td align="left">32.8</td><td align="left">34.7</td><td char="&#x2013;" align="char">2.9&#x2013;8.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sodium (mmol/L)</td><td align="left">133</td><td align="left">137</td><td align="left">136</td><td align="left">142</td><td char="&#x2013;" align="char">135&#x2013;148</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Potassium (mmol/L)</td><td align="left">4.3</td><td align="left">3.9</td><td align="left">4.8</td><td align="left">5.4</td><td char="&#x2013;" align="char">3.5&#x2013;5.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">AST (u/L)</td><td align="left">48</td><td align="left">151</td><td align="left">109</td><td align="left">126</td><td char="&#x2013;" align="char">10&#x2013;35</td></tr><tr><td align="left">ALT (u/L)</td><td align="left">49</td><td align="left">74</td><td align="left">88</td><td align="left">92</td><td char="&#x2013;" align="char">10&#x2013;40</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Serum bilirubin (&#xB5;mol/L)</td><td align="left">84</td><td align="left">230</td><td align="left">690</td><td align="left">837</td><td char="&#x2013;" align="char">5.1&#x2013;22</td></tr><tr><td align="left">INR</td><td align="left">1.26</td><td align="left">1.8</td><td align="left">2.1</td><td align="left">3.2</td><td char="&#x2013;" align="char">1&#x2013;1.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">APTT</td><td align="left">58</td><td align="left">69</td><td align="left">87.9</td><td align="left">116</td><td char="&#x2013;" align="char">28&#x2013;42</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Leptospirosis and dengue are increasingly being recognized as a cause of acute febrile illness in tropics and subtropics, putting almost half of the world&#x2019;s population at risk. Sri Lanka, with a population of 25 million, represents an endemic region for both leptospirosis and dengue infections due to the geographic and climatic aspects of the country and the socioeconomic characteristics of its population.</p>
      <p>Dengue fever is currently the most important mosquito-borne viral infection of public health significance in Sri Lanka, with thousands of patients acquiring the infection each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Dengue fever is caused by any of the four dengue virus serotypes (DEN 1&#x2013;4) which are closely related. Dengue virus serotypes 2 and 3 were the predominant circulating serotypes in Sri Lanka until 2009. However, since 2010, dengue serotype 1 has become the predominant serotype in Sri Lanka accounting for more than 95&#xA0;% of dengue infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease which is endemic in Sri Lanka. The reported annual incidence of leptospirosis in Sri Lanka is 5.4 cases/100,000 persons, the sixth highest incidence worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, incidence rates are imprecise estimates because leptospirosis is easily confused with undifferentiated fever of other causes, and few cases are laboratory confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There have been a tremendous increase in the number of cases reported in the recent years, with 7,421 cases (incidence rate 36.7/100,000 population) and 207 deaths (case fatality ate 2.8&#xA0;%) reported in 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>Cases of dengue and leptospirosis were seen throughout the year with incidence of both disease peak during the monsoon leading to concurrent epidemics. The clinical manifestations of leptospirosis and dengue range from a mild self-limiting febrile illness to a severe and potentially fatal illness characterized by thrombocytopenia, bleeding, hepatitis with cholestatic jaundice, myositis and renal failure. The vast overlapping spectrum of symptomatic manifestations of dengue and leptospirosis makes the clinical diagnosis challenging for treating physicians when acute co-infection is present.</p>
      <p>An Indian study revealed that 1.7&#xA0;% of patients presented with acute febrile illness have co-infection with leptospirosis and dengue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As Sri Lanka and India share common geographic, climatic and socio-demographic characteristics, a similar incidence of co-infection with leptospirosis and dengue can be expected in Sri Lanka as well. The fact that the co-infection with leptospirosis and dengue has not been previously reported in Sri Lanka is most probably due to under-diagnosis and under-reporting rather than the rarity of its occurrence.</p>
      <p>Even though co-infection with leptospirosis and dengue carries a high mortality rate, early administration of appropriate antibiotics is important as it has been shown to reduce the duration and severity of leptospirosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, clinicians in areas where both leptospirosis and dengue are endemic should include both infections in the differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with acute febrile illness and should consider the possibility of co-infection.</p>
