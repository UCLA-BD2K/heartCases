      <p>Coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) is defined as the dilation of the coronary artery measuring 1.5 times the diameter of a normal adjacent segment and &#x201C;Giant&#x201D; CAA has a diameter &gt;2&#x200A;cm.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The causative factors for giant CAA include atherosclerosis, Takayasu arteritis, congenital disorders, and Kawasaki disease.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Coronary artery fistula (CAF) is abnormal communication between epicardial coronary arteries and cardiac chambers or vessels around the heart.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> CAA formation occurs in about 15% to 19% of patients with CAF,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and giant CAA can be found in 5.9% of patients with CAF.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Anomaly of the anterior descending coronary artery arising from the right coronary artery (RCA) is rare in a heart without a congenital defect. It occurs frequently in patients with Tetralogy of Fallot and a similar appearance is present in L-loop (corrected) transposition of the great arteries, owing to inversion of the coronary arteries.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> We present a patient with giant CAA that has a fistulous connection to the right ventricle (RV) in whom the anterior descending coronary artery arose from a dominant RCA, a complicated case with untreated Kawasaki disease.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 36-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a 20-year history of progressively chest distress on exertion. This symptom relieved after oxygen inhalation. She did not have any cardiovascular risk factors, but had a history of acute febrile illness at 5 years of age who was diagnosed as having Kawasaki disease but without timely treatment. Physical examination revealed a grade 3/6 systolic murmur heard in the second and third intercostal space at left sternum. Blood pressure was 109/60&#x200A;mmHg in the left arm, and 125/67&#x200A;mmHg in the right arm. Laboratory tests revealed elevated levels of prothrombin time, fibrinogen, D-dimer, troponin, myoglobin, and creatine kinase. Electrocardiogram and chest X-ray were within normal limits.</p>
      <p>Transthoracic echocardiography showed dilation of the left main coronary artery to 1.0&#x200A;cm, a cystic lesion localized in the apex of interventricular septum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A) in which there was a hyperechoic mass (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>b) and a dilated, tortuous vessel, which was considered as the anterior descending coronary artery connected with the cystic lesion. Doppler color flow imaging showed a diastolic flow in the previous abnormal vessel with peak velocity achieved 2.85&#x200A;m/s (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C).</p>

      <p>Multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) both revealed a saccular aneurysm locating in interventricular septum in which there was a fixed density/signal lesion that was not enhanced by the contrast media, and the enlarged, tortuous left main coronary artery supplied this aneurysm.

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Kawasaki disease is an acute systemic inflammatory disorder with coronary artery aneurysm or ectasia as its main complication. The most commonly affected part is in the proximal end of the main blood vessel and the left anterior descending part.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The aneurismal sac may be saccular or fusiform, and the former is more easily to rupture, thrombosis or fistula formation.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> CAF can be associated with giant CAA and the RCA is more commonly affected. The drainage is carried out for low-pressure chambers, most commonly the RV.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The clinical manifestations of CAF depend on the magnitude of the blood flow through the fistula and its location. Most CAFs are asymptomatic, but some patients present with palpitations, exertional dyspnea, angina, or myocardial infarction, all of which may be attributable to a coronary &#x201C;steal phenomenon&#x201D; and myocardial ischemia.</p>
      <p>Anomaly of the anterior descending coronary artery arising from the RCA in patients without congenital heart defect has been rarely reported. Its incidence was reported to be 0.03% among 126,595 cases.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In case reports of patients in whom the anterior descending coronary artery takes origin from the RCA, the RCA usually is the &#x201C;dominant&#x201D; vessel. And a report<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> described a patient in whom the anterior descending coronary artery arose from a small, nondominant RCA.</p>
      <p>Without doubt, it is reasonable to speculate that the patient developed a giant CAA in left main coronary artery owing to the delayed treatment of Kawasaki disease in the childhood. The CAF was secondary to the giant CAA, which leads to the occurrence of symptoms for the transient myocardial ischemia from the &#x201C;coronary steal&#x201D; effect in adulthood. In this case, Kawasaki disease mainly affected the left main coronary artery and the RCA was relatively normal. We speculate that the occurrence of the anomaly of the anterior descending coronary artery arising from the RCA is good for the improvement of myocardial blood supply.</p>
      <p>Presently, no treatment guidelines or follow-up recommendations exist for this rarity because the patient had missed the best diagnosis and therapy period. It is recommended that hemodynamically significant fistula and large, saccular, rapidly growing or symptom-causing aneurysms and very large or need surgical treatment.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Surgical treatment was selected to release her symptom. And she was in a healthy status during the 12-month follow-up.</p>
      <p>We report a giant CAA, which has a fistulous connection to RV associated with anomalous origin of the anterior descending coronary artery from the RCA, in a 67-year-old woman who suffered with a 20-year history of progressive chest distress on exertion and a history of untreated Kawasaki disease in the childhood. To the best of our knowledge with literature review, this is the first reported complicated case diagnosed with multiple imaging approaches. Surgical removal of the CAA and closure of the CAF were successfully performed, and the patient had an uneventful recovery and no serious complications.</p>
