          <title>Background: </title>
          <p>Delaitre and Maignien performed the first successful laparoscopic splenectomy in
1991. After that, laparoscopic splenectomy has become one of the most frequently
performed laparoscopic solid organ procedures. </p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Aim: </title>
          <p>To demonstrate the surgical techique of laparoscopic splenetomy with reduced
portals. </p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods: </title>
          <p>A reduce port laparoscopic splenectomy was performed by using a 10 mm and two 5 mm
trocars. To entered the abdomen a trans-umbilical open technique was done and a 10
mm trocar was placed. A subcostal 5 mm trocar was placed under direct vision at
the level of the anterior axillary line and another 5 mm port was inserted at the
mid-epigastric region. Once it was completely dissected and freed from all of its
attachments the hilum, splenic artery and vein, was clipped with hem-o-lock and
divided with scissors. Then an endobag was used to retrieve the spleen after being
morcellated trough the umbilical incision.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title> Results: </title>
          <p>This technique was used in a 15 years old female with epigastric and left upper
quadrant pain. An abdominal ultrasound demonstrated a giant cyst located in the
spleen. Laboratory tests findings were normal. The CT scan was also done, and
showed a giant cyst, which squeeze the stomach. The patient tolerated well the
procedure, with an unremarkable postoperative. She was discharge home 72 h after
the surgery. </p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion: </title>
          <p>The use of reduce port minimizes abdominal trauma and has the hypothetical
advantages of shorter postoperative stay, greater pain control, and better
cosmesis. Laparoscopic splenectomy for giant cysts by using reduce port trocars is
safe and feasible and less invasive.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Splenectomy was initially described for hereditary spherocytosis by Sutherland and
Burghard in 1910 and for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura by Kaznelson in 1916<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. It has been well recognized as an effective cure
for hematologic disorders, better than medical treatment. The first successful
laparoscopic splenectomy was performed by Delaitre and Maignien in 1991<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. After that, laparoscopic splenectomy has
become one of the most frequently performed laparoscopic solid organ procedures.</p>
      <p>Laparoscopic splenectomy is emerging as the gold standard for the management of various
hematologic disorders. Minimally invasive surgery has earned boundless acceptance. The
enthusiasm to limit the trauma of large incisions has been the incentive of the
development of minimally invasive surgery during the past century. Numerous technology
and equipment in laparoscopy have been emerging. It started gradually reducing and
repositioning trocars during laparoscopic surgery. It began with repositioning the
subxiphoid trocar into the umbilicus. Less trocars equals less abdominal trauma. In
small spleens a single port laparoscopic surgery can be performed. In large spleens,
less trocars can be used. </p>
      <p>The aim of this artcile is to details the splenectomy procedure using only three
trochars.</p>

      <title>METHOD</title>
      <sec>
        <title>Surgical technique</title>
        <p>The patient is placed in lateral decubitus, to enter the abdomen using a
trans-umbilical open technique and a 12 mm trocar is placed. Through it a 10 mm
30<sup>o</sup> scope is inserted. A subcostal 5 mm trocar is placed under direct
vision at the level of the anterior axillary line and another 5 mm port is inserted
at the midepigastric region. Using a 5 mm harmonic scalpel (Harmonic Ace, Ethicon)
and 5 mm instruments, access is gained to the lesser sac by dividing the
gastrosplenic ligament and short vessels until the upper pole of the spleen. The
splenic flexure of the colon is mobilized to get the lower pole of the spleen freed.
The posterior splenorenal ligament is then freed. </p>
        <p>Once the spleen is completely dissected free from all of its hilum attachments,
splenic artery and vein are clipped with hemolocks and divided with scissors. It is
suggested clipping the artery first and then the vein, this can reduce the size of
the spleen in an important percentage. This is specially useful when dealing with
great size spleen. Then an endobag is used to retrieve the spleen after being
morcellated through the umbilical incision. A drain, exteriorized through the lateral
5 mm trocar is used routinely. </p>
      </sec>

    <sec>
      <title>RESULT</title>
      <p>This technique was used in a 15 years old female refered due to epigastric and left
upper quadrant pain. An abdominal ultrasound was performed in order to find gallblader
stones, but a giant cyst located in the spleen was found. Laboratory tests were normal.
The CT scan showed a giant cyst which squeeze the stomach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). The patient was scheduled for surgery, and a laparoscopic
approach was performed.</p>

</p>
      <p>Lateral positioning was used and with open technique the abdomen was entered. A 10 mm
trocar was inserted at the umbilicus and two more trocars were placed in the left upper
quadrant. Once the abdomen was entered a gian cyst located in the spleen was observed
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>). The ligaments were divided with
electronic shears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3</xref> A) and the splenic
vein and artery were ligated by using hemolocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The first successful laparoscopic splenectomy was performed by Delaitre and Maignien in
1991<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. After that, laparoscopic splenectomy has
become one of the most frequently performed laparoscopic solid organ procedures.</p>
      <p>Regarding the surgical technique, the lateral positioning is the preferred approach for
laparoscopic splenectomy because the gravity effect pulls down the colon, stomach and
omentum and allows better visualization of the spleen. Three left subcostal ports are
usually adequate for normal-sized spleens. In the presence of splenomegaly, ports are
optimally positioned 4 cm below the inferior tip of the spleen, parallel to the left
costal margin, but within reach of the diaphragm. If the spleen is extremely large, the
trocars may have to be placed substantially more inferiorly than normal, creating the
need for an additional port posteriorly. This port allows for lateral retraction of the
spleen and can facilitate access to the diaphragmatic attachments. Additional ports are
placed under laparoscopic guidance. Visualization and efficiency are optimized by
exchanging the camera between the medial and lateral ports, while the surgeon operates
with both hands<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.</p>
      <p>Supermassive spleens are most effectively managed with a hand-assisted approach. This
approach utilizes similar patient positioning but uses a hand-assisted device to
facilitate insertion of the surgeon's nondominant hand into the abdominal cavity while
maintaining pneumoperitoneum. This technique allows for improved tissue handling and
atraumatic manipulation of the enlarged spleen. For patients with supermassive spleens,
lateral positioning is altered slightly. In these cases, the patient is placed supine
with the left side elevated at 45&#xB0;. This allows the surgeon to take advantage of gravity
while also providing comfortable access through the hand-assist incision.</p>
      <p>Depending upon the hand dominance of the surgeon, the hand-assist device can be placed
in either a midline (right-hand dominant) or a subcostal position (left-hand dominant)
through a 7 to 8 cm incision which is located 2 to 4 cm caudal to the inferior pole of
the enlarged spleen. In both situations, the surgeon stands on the right side of the
patient. The nondominant hand is inserted through the hand-assist device and provides
medial retraction and rotation of the spleen. The hilar pedicle is transected with an
endoscopic gastrointestinal anastomotic stapler utilizing a vascular cartridge. The
spleen is placed into an appropriately-sized impermeable retrieval bag. This bag must be
strong enough to avoid rupture during morcellation and extraction of the specimen.
Placing the spleen into the retrieval bag can be one of the most time-consuming and
challenging aspects of the operation but it's necessary in order to avoid possible
splenosis which is unwanted in many hematologic disease. The patient is placed into
Trendelenburg's position and the spleen is gradually directed into the bag. After the
spleen is within the retrieval bag, the opening of the bag is delivered through the
largest port site or the hand-assist incision and the spleen is morcellated with ringed
forceps.</p>
      <p>The most common hematologic disorder that requires splenectomy is the idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura where surgery is indicated in patients with refractory
symptomatic thrombocytopenia after 4 to 6 weeks of medical therapy, patients requiring
toxic doses of steroids to achieve remission, and patients who relapse following an
initial response to steroid therapy. Hereditary spherocytosis (hereditary hemolytic
anemia), is curable in approximately 90% of patients after splenectomy. Surgery is
indicated for all patients with hereditary spherocytosis and splenomegaly, for patients
with symptoms of severe hemolytic anemia or mild hemolytic anemia and concomitant
gallstones, and for patients with cholelithiasis in siblings<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.</p>
      <p>Other indications for splenectomy are HIV-related, thrombocytopenic purpura systemic,
lupus erythematosus-related, thrombocytopenic purpura, thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemias, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Hairy cell leukemia<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.</p>
      <p>The contraindications to laparoscopic splenectomy can be divided into: absolute
contraindications like, severe cardiopulmonary disease or cirrhosis with portal
hypertension. And relative contraindication are previous abdominal surgery (open Hasson
technique is mandatory) and some authors include massive splenectomy<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>.</p>
      <p>Laparoscopic splenectomy is emerging as the gold standard for the management of various
hematologic disorders. Since the first laparoscopic splenectomies were performed in
adults (1991) and children (1993), laparoscopic splenectomy has become the gold standard
for the elective removal of normal sized spleens. It clearly has been shown to have less
morbidity and postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay, earlier return of bowel
function, and superior cosmesis compared with open splenectomy<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. </p>
      <p>Although laparoscopic splenectomy is superior to open splenectomy for normal sized
spleens, splenomegaly has been considered a contraindication to the laparoscopic
approach because of difficulties with bleeding and removal from the abdomen. Over the
last years, however, several authors have reported laparoscopic removal of enlarged
spleens. With the development of hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery, the retraction of
massive spleens was technically feasible. Recent studies, have shown that, aside from
operative time, there is no difference in transfusions, length of stay, morbidity, or
conversion rate with laparoscopic splenectomy for large spleens compared with normal
sized spleens.</p>
      <p>Laparoscopic techniques, surgical skills, and instrumentation have improved, so are
safety and efficacy even in the presence of splenomegaly.</p>
      <p>Authors like Kent W. Kercher et al.<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, made a
study on 177 patients who underwent laparoscopic splenectomy where forty-nine patients
(28%) were identified as having massive splenomegaly. They defined massive splenomegaly
as a craniocaudal length &#x2265;17 cm or a weight &#x2265;600 g. Spleens greater than 22 cm in
craniocaudal length, 19 cm in width, or a weight greater than 1600 g were defined as
"supermassive." And in children, splenic size greater than four times normal for age was
defined as massive. They recommend that most surgeons acquire their initial laparoscopic
experience with normal-sized spleens prior to attempting laparoscopic splenectomy of
splenomegaly. And the author conclude that laparoscopic splenectomy has become the gold
standard for elective splenectomy in patients with normal-sized spleens and laparoscopic
splenectomy in the setting of massive splenomegaly is safe and effective providing
distinct advantages over the open operation. In the presence of supermassive
splenomegaly, the use of hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery maintains the benefits of a
minimally invasive approach<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.</p>
      <p>Other authors like Arin K. Greene <sup>7</sup>, have used the Lahey bag to remove a
massive spleen. The author describe that this technique facilitate the removal of
massively enlarged spleens laparoscopically (&gt;1,000 g), because a large abdominal
incision to remove the spleen is not required. The spleen is broken up while in the
Lahey bag so the risk of splenosis is eliminated.</p>
      <p>Because of suitable single port laparoscopy equipment is not available to may centers
due to cost, Colon et al.<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> developed a technique
where additional instrumentation was kept to a minimum. Boone et al.<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> demonstrate in their series that single port
splenectomy is safe and feasible in an unselected patient population, their patient
population included patients with prior surgery, obese patients, medical comorbidities,
splenomegaly, and severe thrombocytopenia. In their study they also compared it to
standard laparoscopic splenectomy. The results showed no statistically significance in
morbidity and mortality between both groups. Analysis of postoperative pain medication
requirement revealed that the single incision patients required fewer narcotics, but
this did not reach statistical significance either. Single port splenectomy was
associates with a significantly lower open conversion, shorter operative time, and
similar median estimated blood loss. Overall, the study demonstrated that it is at least
equivalent to standard laparoscopic splenectomy. They enounced that single port
splenectomy is an appropriate procedure that can be done safely and may lead to higher
patient satisfaction compared to laparoscopic splenectomy. Also, they stated, while
articulating instruments and laparoscopes may offer technical advantages, they are not
completely necessary for performing single port splenectomy. It is a safe and feasible
technique to perform splenectomy for small spleens, but in giant and massive spleens,
the reduce port laparoscopic surgery technique is a better choice.</p>
      <p> Laparoscopic splenectomy has become the gold standard for normal size spleens. Massive
splenomegaly is not a contraindication for laparoscopic surgery moreover with the
develop of the hand assisted technique that is feasible and safe. Morbidity and
mortality are equivalent when coparing with regular laparoscopic splenectomy.</p>

      <p>The use of reduce port minimizes abdominal trauma and has the hypothetical advantages of
shorter postoperative stay, greater pain control, and better cosmesis. Laparoscopic
splenectomy for giant cysts by using reduce port trocars is safe and feasible and less
invasive.</p>
