          <p>Awareness, prompt diagnosis and effective treatment of compartment syndrome
caused by a rare bleeding disorder, which is usually acquired by the
elderly, is essential and may spare a patient from surgery or even limb
loss, if early administration of recombinant factor VIIa is effective. The
course of disease in a patient with operative management of spontaneous
bleeding, compartment syndrome and acquired hemophilia A may be prolonged.
However, an interdisciplinary approach with meticulous surgical treatment
and bleeding management with recombinant factor VIIa as well as inhibitor
eradication by immunosuppressive treatment can be successful and
expensive.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Spontaneous bleeding and compartment syndrome due to acquired hemophilia A, which is
defined by factor VIII deficiency caused by an inhibitory antibody to factor VIII,
is extremely rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This is in contrast to the more well-known and rather common compartment
syndrome due to traumatic etiologies, of which the majority may be attributed to
fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Only a few case reports have focused on compartment syndrome in the
realm of acquired hemophilia A in the adult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and pediatric population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], respectively. Almost all of these case reports addressed problems in the
upper extremities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] or described conservative treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. There is a lack of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] on operative management of compartment syndrome due to acquired
hemophilia A and none describe this entity on the lower extremities. Therefore, we
present a case of atraumatic compartment syndrome of the lower leg due to acquired
hemophilia A, in an elderly Caucasian man who was treated surgically with a long and
complicated postoperative course.</p>

      <title>Case presentation</title>
      <p>An 83-year-old Caucasian man of European descent presented to a community hospital
with a 2-day history of increasing pain and swelling in his left lower leg without a
previous history of trauma. His relevant past medical history included fasciotomy of
an atraumatic compartment syndrome of his left thigh 2&#xA0;months ago, traumatic
hemarthrosis of his right knee half a year ago and a 2-year course of low-dose
steroid therapy for polymyalgia. Furthermore, he had hypertensive cardiomyopathy,
permanent atrial fibrillation, benign prostate hyperplasia, presbyacusis, and a
history of surgery for patellar tendon rupture 1&#xA0;year ago. Aside from
prednisolone 5mg/day, he took nebivolol 2.5mg/day, torasemide 10mg/day and
tamsulosin 0.4mg/day. Warfarin had been stopped 2&#xA0;months ago after his
compartment syndrome of the thigh.</p>
      <p>During physical examination, he had pain at rest, to palpation and with passive
stretching of the foot (Numeric Rating Scale 4 to 5) at his left lower leg. Marked
swelling with emerging tension blisters was found at his proximal anterior tibia.
His peripheral pulses were palpable and his neurologic status was intact. There were
no systemic signs of disease. Ultrasound revealed a hematoma, 6&#xD7;3&#xD7;2cm, in
the anterior tibial compartment, but no evidence of vessel pathology or deep vein
thrombosis. Compartment pressure of the anterior tibial compartment was measured
with the help of a pressure monitoring device and was markedly elevated. Laboratory
findings included an elevated C-reactive protein of 94mg/L (normal &lt;5mg/L),
decreased hemoglobin of 86g/L (normal 125 to 172g/L), decreased hematocrit of
0.28L/L (normal 0.37 to 0.49L/L) and prothrombin time (PT) of 87% (normal 70 to
100%). Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT; normal 24 to 36&#xA0;seconds)
was not measured because it was falsely not deemed relevant or simply forgotten at
that time.</p>
      <p>The diagnosis of compartment syndrome was made and the patient underwent immediate
lateral fasciotomy with a limited incision of approximately 5cm of the anterior
tibial compartment by a rather small skin incision and subcutaneous fascia release
as described by Mubarak and Owen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] (Table&#xA0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> outlines the course of disease). The
anterior tibialis muscles protruded instantly and were still vital. The wound was
left open and covered with dressings. Two days later, secondary hemorrhage and foot
drop (M3, active movement against gravity) developed. Thus, he was taken to the
operating room again and a hematoma within the anterior tibial compartment was
evacuated. Postoperatively, his foot drop mildly improved. Again, 2&#xA0;days later,
another secondary hematoma occurred and he was transferred to a larger regional
hospital in order to treat his condition, with its peculiar laboratory findings and
uncontrollable bleeding, in the realm of an interdisciplinary approach. The lateral
fasciotomy wound was lengthened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, his aPTT was measured and found to be elevated, which
prompted further hematologic evaluation. On the fifth postoperative day, diagnosis
of acquired hemophilia A was finally made by a hematology consultant. Due to massive
unstoppable bleeding of approximately 0.5L/hour accompanied by a fall in hematocrit
from 29% to 19.5%, despite the administration of four units of red blood cells,
recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) was used as a single bleeding control agent and
corticosteroids (1mg/kg body weight) were increased for inhibitor eradication. Of
note, no other blood products or factor replacements were administered. In our
hospital, we also do not administer factor VIII inhibitor bypass activity (FEIBA)
routinely in acquired hemophilia A, but reserve this treatment for refractory
hereditary cases. With this drug therapy in place and the assumption that his
uncontrolled bleeding had been controlled, vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy was
instigated. VAC therapy represents the regional standard therapy for most open
wounds and even though it may monitor the amount of bleeding, it does not provide
visual control. However, secondary hemorrhage occurred again and the patient was
transferred to a university hospital.</p>

      <p>In order to halt the uncontrollable bleeding, the wound was covered with a special
dressing with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) foam, a jetting hose through which the wound
was kept moist and a big bulky absorbable dressing (Figures&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>a, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>b). On day 15, implementation of VAC therapy
failed again and uncontrollable bleeding led to further therapy with the special
dressing mentioned above (Figures&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>a and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). By this time, the patient had received at least seven units of red
blood cells and almost 20 administrations of NovoSeven&#xAE; (rFVIIa), usually in
the dose of 7mg each. No other blood products were used except for 1g of tranexamic
acid intraoperatively on his arrival at the university hospital. At that point his
factor VIII was still 3%. For the next 2&#xA0;weeks, dressing changes were
undertaken at regular intervals of approximately 3&#xA0;days. Administration of
rFVIIa at regular intervals, at least once a day just shortly before dressing
changes was continued. His factor VIII started to rise slowly, beginning on day 17
with 9%. After 4&#xA0;weeks, his factor VIII had risen to 41% and VAC therapy could
be applied again in order to condition the wound for definite closure
(Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>b). After another VAC change, and rise of
factor VIII to 88%, a split-thickness skin graft was carried out 1.5&#xA0;months
after the first fasciotomy. At this time, rFVIIa support was no longer necessary.
After leaving a VAC on top of the split-thickness skin graft for 5&#xA0;days, mild
delayed wound healing was observed in the anterior middle and posterior distal parts
of the wound (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>a). This was treated with
AQUACEL&#xAE;&#x2009;(primary wound dressing) and Mepitel&#xAE; (wound contact
layer), (wound contact layer), while the rest of the wound was dressed with dry
padding. In the meantime, factor VIII had increased &gt;100% and corticosteroid
therapy could be reduced in a stepwise fashion approximately twice a month. After
discharging the patient into a rehabilitation clinic 2&#xA0;months postoperatively,
he was frequently seen in our out-patient clinic (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>b). After 3.5&#xA0;months, small parts of the wound had still not
healed (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>c), and a split-thickness skin graft was
carried out for a second time (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>a to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>c) Afterward, wound healing went slowly, but finally succeeded
approximately 5&#xA0;months after his initial presentation while his factor VIII
remained normal and prednisone was stopped 5&#xA0;months after diagnosis
(Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). He had 5 out of 5 muscle strength
globally, but needed to ambulate with crutches after being confined to bed rest for
a long time.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, the patient was hospitalized again after 4.5&#xA0;months. This time,
he had developed a spontaneous hematoma in his left iliopsoas muscle. It was not due
to a relapse of acquired anti-factor VIII deficiency, but rivaroxaban, which had
been administered for intermittent atrial fibrillation. From that point, oral
anticoagulants were stopped and he only received low-molecular-weight heparins daily
while immobilized. Unfortunately, he developed cholangitis, which was suspected due
to icterus and increased cholestasis/liver parameters followed by an ultrasound and
a computed tomography scan of the abdomen as well as a magnetic resonance
cholangiopancreatography and finally confirmed by a liver biopsy. He is scheduled
for a rehabilitation program in order to regain normal ambulation without crutches
upon his discharge from our hospital.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Acquired hemophilia is a rare hemorrhagic disorder and occurs at a rate of
approximately one person per million each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It mainly affects the elderly without gender preference. Spontaneous
remission may occur in up to one-third of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Nonetheless, the mortality rate has been reported to be as high as 22%
in a survey by Green and Lechner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Acquired hemophilia is caused by formation of an inhibitory antibody
directed against coagulation factor VIII. Its origin is idiopathic in approximately
half of cases (46 to 65%), but may be related to other medical conditions, such as
autoimmune disorders in about 18%, malignancies (7 to 15%) or the post-partum period
(7 to 11%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It may lead to severe and potentially life-threatening bleeding once
factor VIII decreases &lt;25%. Suspicion usually arises with uncontrollable bleeding
after a surgical procedure or spontaneous bleeding in patients with no history of a
bleeding disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The diagnosis should be suspected with prolonged aPTT. A prolonged aPTT
may be attributable to several causes, such as coagulation factor deficiencies,
lupus anticoagulant or heparin therapy and differentiation is achieved by mixing
tests, where the plasma of the patient is mixed with normal plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Initially normal, but increased aPTT after 2&#xA0;hours of incubation is
suggestive of autoantibodies to factor VIII. Yet, the PT remains normal. Mixing
studies of aPTT can be performed in most laboratories and support the suspicion of
acquired hemophilia. More specifically, factor VIII can be quantified and is usually
decreased &lt;50%. Afterward, the antibody is assessed with the Bethesda assay,
which measures residual factor VIII in the plasma of the patient after incubation
with plasma from a healthy person [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Therapeutic approaches include bleeding control with a so-called
bypassing agent, either rFVIIa (NovoSeven&#xAE;) or activated prothrombin complex
(FEIBA&#xAE;) and antibody eradication with prednisone alone or in combination with
other immunosuppressives, such as cyclophosphamide or rituximab. RFVIIa activates
factor X via the extrinsic system in the absence of factor VIII. Thus, thrombin and
fibrin are activated and blood clotting follows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, rFVIIa has a short half-life of only 2&#xA0;hours and requires
frequent administrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Prednisone is the classic first-line therapy for antibody eradication
and is effective in about 30 to 75% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Cyclophosphamide has been shown to increase the overall response rate,
but is usually not used initially due to its severe side effects, particularly
infectious complications in the cohort of old to very old patients. In addition,
transfusions are necessary in almost 90% of cases.</p>
      <p>Compartment syndrome is rare with an incidence of three per 100,000 people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Men are more commonly affected. The origin is a rise in pressure inside
a muscle compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Compartment syndrome is often caused by hematoma formation due to
fractures. There are four muscle compartments in the calf. The anterior compartment
is most commonly affected, it contains the dorsiflexors of the foot and the deep
peroneal nerve; the lateral compartment contains the foot elevators, part of the
plantar flexors and the superficial fibular nerve. The posterior compartment is
subdivided into a superficial and deep compartment; it contains the plantar flexors
and the tibial nerve. Failure to recognize compartment syndrome or delay in
treatment may lead to serious disability. Compartment syndrome is a clinical
diagnosis. Progressive nerve symptoms, such as paresthesia, are the first symptoms
and usually arise within 30&#xA0;minutes. The remaining classically described
&#x201C;six Ps&#x201D; &#x2013; pain, pallor, pulselessness, pressure, poikilothermia
and paralysis &#x2013; often arise too late, because irreversible tissue damage may
begin within 3&#xA0;hours, as described in a cohort analysis of 76 patients by
Vaillancourt <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Compartment pressures can be measured non-invasively or invasively.
Pressures &gt;30mmHg have been accepted as an indication for fasciotomy in order to
avoid irreversible tissue damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Fasciotomy incisions should be large enough to sufficiently decompress
affected compartments and in the case of the calf measure about 15cm. The approach
is either through a single lateral parafibular incision or combined anterolateral
and posteromedial incisions; the latter is more common. Skin closure should not be
performed until the swelling has reached its peak. As described in a review by
Shadgan <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], there are several options, such as primary closure with skin
reapproximation, split-thickness skin grafting, dermatotraction with staples, vessel
loops and vacuum-assisted wound closure. We usually use vacuum-assisted wound
closure for wound conditioning before split-thickness skin grafting. As summarized
by Holle <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], it functions by stabilizing tissue, giving protection against
infections, improving blood circulation within tissues, and induction of wound
healing. McCallon <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] reported that vacuum-assisted wound closure was able to decrease the
volume of the wound better than normal wound dressings (28 versus 10%) and also led
to faster wound closure (23 versus 43&#xA0;days). In our case, vacuum-assisted wound
closure failed in the initial phase because of the uncontrollable bleeding, but was
effective once bleeding was controlled. As mentioned by Ojike <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], a split-thickness skin graft is usually used to cover large wounds after
compartment syndrome. Schneider <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] attributed wound healing to the equal pressure distribution on the skin
graft in 98% of a total of 100 patients, who were treated with vacuum-assisted wound
closure on top of the skin graft for a couple of days.</p>
      <p>From an economic standpoint, rFVIIa may be expensive for health care providers since
a single dose for an average adult patient costs approximately US$7000. Due to the
short half-life, there is always a need for more than one administration daily for a
course of a couple of weeks. Thus, expenses up to a hundred thousand may arise
quickly. In our case, rFVIIa was given 49 times, which added up to approximately
$340,000. However, the hospital received approximately $60,000 for the
diagnosis-related group. Thus, there is a deficit of $280,000, which has to be paid
by the treating hospital. However, these costs are comparable to other drugs for
rare diseases, such as $250,000 a year for lomitapide for homozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia or $295,000 per year for teduglutide for short bowel syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. A new drug, ibrutinib, for chronic lymphatic leukemia will also cost
$130,000 per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Therefore, it is reasonable to transfer these patients with rare and
difficult-to-treat medical conditions to hospitals with a higher level of care.
Importantly, treatment with rFVIIa needs to be performed adequately and, as in our
case, only be initiated once other factors have been substituted. It is important to
point out that the two treatment priorities of acquired hemophilia A are to arrest
the acute bleeding with rFVIIa and to eradicate the factor VIII autoantibody with
corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p>
      <p>Our case report points out several important facts. We agree with Ilyas <italic>et
al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], who mentioned that atraumatic compartment syndromes due to bleeding
disorders deserve special attention and are easily overlooked. Early suspicion,
investigation and confirmation of an acquired bleeding disorder are very important
in order to avoid invasive investigations or surgeries without adequate support of
coagulation. Usually, compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency because
irreversible tissue injury begins approximately 6&#xA0;hours after onset and may
lead to tissue necrosis, functional impairment and renal failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. It is only within this very short time window that it may be feasible to
perform serial measurements of compartment pressure and postpone surgery in patients
with elevated compartment pressures and hemophilia A because uncontrollable bleeding
may arise during surgery, especially with factor VIII levels &lt;50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. During the first 6&#xA0;hours, first-line treatment consists of bleeding
control with bypassing agents depending on the underlying acquired disorder. But if
compartment pressures remain elevated &#x2265;30mmHg and do not normalize within
2&#xA0;hours, fasciotomy is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Unfortunately, diagnosis of compartment syndrome in the absence of
trauma is commonly delayed and made after 6&#xA0;hours of onset, therefore requiring
immediate fasciotomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Once surgical management is instigated, the course of disease in a
patient with spontaneous bleeding, compartment syndrome and acquired hemophilia A
may be prolonged, complicated, costly and requires a close collaboration between
surgeons and hematologists.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Awareness, prompt diagnosis and effective treatment of compartment syndrome caused by
a rare bleeding disorder, which is usually acquired by the elderly, is essential and
may spare a patient from surgery or even limb loss, if early administration of
rFVIIa is effective. The course of disease in a patient with operative management of
spontaneous bleeding, compartment syndrome and acquired hemophilia A may be
prolonged. However, an interdisciplinary approach with meticulous surgical treatment
and bleeding management with rFVIIa, which proved to be extremely helpful in our
patient, especially pre-operatively, as well as inhibitor eradication by
immunosuppressive treatment can be successful and expensive.</p>
