        <p>Malignant tracheal tumors (primary and secondary) are rare and benign tumors of the tracheobronchial tree are also rare. Few reports have been issued on the <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) findings of tracheal tumors or benign nontumorous tracheal lesions, which have been mainly studied by computed tomography (CT).

The first case was of a 73-year-old woman with colon cancer treated by hemicolectomy and subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy. Follow-up <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT after 6 years revealed a hypermetabolic fungating mass (SUVmax: 5.8) in the distal trachea and biopsy confirmed intratracheal metastasis. The second case involved a 61-year-old man with tongue cancer who underwent mouth floor mass excision and right supraomohyoid neck dissection with submental flap reconstruction. Tracheal lesion was incidentally found during a <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT follow-up study conducted 1 year later. A benign intratracheal condition with low FDG uptake (SUVmax: 1.2) and the lesion was not visualized by neck CT 4 months later. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT uptake was helpful in differentiating benign and malignant intratracheal lesions.</p>

        <title>Case 1</title>
        <p>This case involved a 73-year-old woman with a history of colon cancer treated by hemicolectomy and subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, she had lung and soft tissue metastasis, which were treated by chemotherapy and surgery. Follow-up <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT after 6 years revealed a hypermetabolic fungating mass (SUVmax: 5.8) about 15&#x200A;mm in size in the distal trachea (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A and B). We report it as a malignant lesion that can be both primary and metastasis. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed a multinodular fungating mass in the distal trachea and carina corresponding to the abnormality noted on the <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT scan. Biopsy revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma from colon cancer. Immunohistostaining for Hematoxylin and Eosin (H &amp; E,&#x200A;&#xD7;100) and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) was negative for lung primary tumor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A and B). Cytokeratin 20 and caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX-2) for intestinal differentiation were positive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C and D). Her symptoms included dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and a cough. She was treated by radiation therapy and symptoms were improved.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>In the tracheobronchial tree, primary malignant and benign tumors, and secondary malignant tumors may occur.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Primary malignant tracheal tumors are usually arising from the respiratory epithelium and salivary glands, while most benign tumors are of mesenchymal origin.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The most common primary malignant tumor in the trachea is squamous cell carcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma is also common.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Secondary tracheal malignant tumors arise by direct tumor invasion or hematogenous metastasis, but direct invasion is most common.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Computed tomography (CT) is the standard imaging modality for the diagnosis.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The CT manifestations are similar in both primary and secondary malignant tumors and those of benign tumors are usually nonspecific. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT can provide anatomic and metabolic information regarding these tumors. Tracheal metastasis has been documented from 1890 and the most common primary neoplasms are those of the kidney, breast, colon, thyroid, or melanoma although others have been described.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Primary tumors in the tracheobronchial tree can cause respiratory symptoms, but metastases are usually asymptomatic or show nonspecific symptoms and early diagnosis is difficult.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Tracheal metastasis usually treated with tracheal resection, radiation therapy, endotracheal debridement, endobronchial stents, along with chemotherapy, and the mean overall survival is 1 to 2 years after diagnosis.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, wheezing, or stridor developed during evaluations of cancer patients, tracheal metastasis should be considered.</p>
      <p>Benign tracheal tumors are uncommon,<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and almost all benign tumors are of mesenchymal origin.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Benign tracheal lesions (tumor and nontumorous condition) by <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET study were mainly on the benign tumors and most are hamartomas and squamous cell papillomas.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Benign tumors are usually well demarcated, round, and &#x2264;2&#x200A;cm in diameter, and tend to be asymptomatic until they occlude 50% to 75% of the luminal diameter.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In general, benign tumors show faint or no 18F-FDG uptake, whereas malignant tumors generally show high 18F-FDG uptake. However, carcinoid tumors may show low FDG uptake and atypical pulmonary hamartoma may show high 18F-FDG uptake mimicking malignancy.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Other benign nontumorous intratracheal lesions have been mainly studied by CT, and to our knowledge, no reports have been issued on their <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET or PET/CT findings. A previous CT study<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> reported that adherent mucus and foreign body aspiration can appear as soft tissue nodules. Adherent mucus, which tends to exhibit low attenuation, is probably the most commonly encountered tracheobronchial tree abnormality seen on CT images. The differentiation of mucus and true tumors is usually easy, but may be difficult when mucus is thick and tenacious. Other benign nontumorous lesions, such as tracheal stenosis caused by prolonged intubation and tuberculosis or histoplasmosis, can show concentric soft tissue thickening. Sclerosing tracheitis<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> also can exhibit diffuse circumferential tracheal thickening and inflammatory pseudotumor<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> appears as a tumor-like lesion on the CT image. However, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT scan can provide anatomic and metabolic information on these benign nontumorous lesions, as occurred in our second case. In this case, the patient had no respiratory symptoms and the tracheal lesion disappeared without treatment at his 4-month follow-up by neck CT, which indicated that the lesion was not a tumor, but rather a common benign condition. These findings indicate when an intratracheal lesion shows mild or faint <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake, a CT follow-up study is a better choice than an invasive study.</p>
      <p>The author reports a rare case of intratracheal metastasis and of a benign nontumorous condition, and that these 2 cases had quite different <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake intensities. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT was helpful in differentiating benign and malignant intratracheal lesions.</p>
