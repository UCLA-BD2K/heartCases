        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>An 8-year-old neutered female Cavalier King Charles spaniel was evaluated for
progressing right forelimb lameness. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the
right-side radial nerves and the caudal brachial plexus were swollen. The histological and
molecular biological diagnosis by partial biopsy of the C8 spinal nerve was T-cell
lymphoma. Coadministration of lomustine and irradiation was started. However, this therapy
was ineffective. At necropsy, neoplastic tissues were seen extending into the subarachnoid
space of the spinal cord, liver, pancreas and kidneys as gross findings. A large mass was
also identified occupying the caudal thorax. Histologic findings included infiltration in
these organs and the mass by neoplastic lymphocytes. To date, involvement of peripheral
nerves (neurolymphomatosis) is rarely reported in veterinary species.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Lymphoma is one of the most common neoplasias in dogs [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The majority of lymphomas in dogs occur in parenchymatous organs and/or
peripheral lymph nodes with occasional primary or secondary involvement of the brain and
spinal cord [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. On the other hand, involvement of peripheral nerves (neurolymphomatosis) is
rarely reported in veterinary species. Neurolymphomatosis is a rare condition defined as
infiltration of peripheral nerves or nerve roots by neurotropic lymphoma or leukemia [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In humans, there are 4 basic clinical presentations: 1)
painful polyneuropathy or polyradiculopathy, 2) cranial neuropathy, 3) painless polyneuropathy
and 4) peripheral mononeuropathy [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Most human
neurolymphomatosis cases are diffuse large B-cell lymphomas when classified by the Revised
European- American Lymphoma or World Health Organization (WHO) system [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. We present a case of a dog with
multicentric T-cell lymphoma involving the right radius nerve and the caudal brachial
plexus.</p>
    <p>An 8-year-old, neutered, female, Cavalier King Charles spaniel was brought to the Rakuno
Gakuen University Veterinary Teaching Hospital with a 20-day history of progressive right
forelimb lameness. Neurological examination by the referring veterinarian revealed knuckling
and decreased superficial cutaneous sensation in the right forelimb. The dog had been treated
with oral prednisolone.</p>
    <p>On initial referral to our hospital (day 1), the dog&#x2019;s general physical condition was good.
The dog showed right forelimb lameness and, when standing, put a little weight on this leg
intermittently. There was marked muscle atrophy of the right triceps muscles. On flexion and
extension of the limb, the dog did not show pain related to a specific bone or joint. Physical
examination did not reveal any masses or superficial lymphadenopathy upon constitutional
palpation. The dog did not show any discomfort upon auxiliary palpation. The deficit of the
left forelimb was not detected remarkably in a neurological examination. The cutaneous trunci
reflex was present. Cranial nerve reflexes were functionally normal (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The results of neurological examination</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" align="left" colspan="1"/><th colspan="4" align="center" rowspan="1">Day 1</th><th colspan="4" align="center" rowspan="1">Day 28</th><th colspan="4" align="center" rowspan="1">Day 42</th></tr><tr><th colspan="12" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LF</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RF</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LR</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RR</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LF</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RF</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LR</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RR</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LF</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RF</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LR</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RR</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CP</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td colspan="13" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Flexor reflex</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td colspan="13" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Biceps reflex</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x2013;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x2013;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x2013;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x2013;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x2013;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x2013;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="13" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Triceps reflex</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x2013;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x2013;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x2013;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x2013;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x2013;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x2013;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="13" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cutaneous trunci reflex</td><td align="center" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Normal</td><td align="center" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Not detected on either side</td><td align="center" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Not detected on either side</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>LF: Left forelimb, RF: Right forelimb, LR: Left pelvic limb, RR: Right pelvic limb, CP:

plexus, spinal nerves and spinal roots at the C6-T2 level were suspected. As differential
diagnoses, neoplasia, intervertebral disc disease and inflammatory disease were suspected.
Serum biochemical abnormalities included high alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP, 1,273
unit/<italic>l</italic>; reference range, 11 to 140
unit/<italic>l</italic>) and high alanine aminotransferase activity (ALT, 127
unit/<italic>l</italic>; reference range, 10 to 90 unit/<italic>l</italic>). The dog&#x2019;s whole
cell blood count (CBC) and 3-view thoracic (left lateral [LL], right lateral [RL] and
ventrodorsal [VD]), spinal and right forelimb radiographs showed no significant
abnormalities.</p>
    <p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on day 14. The images were obtained using a
low-field MRI unit incorporating an open 0.2-T unit permanent magnet (Sigma Profile, GE
Healthcare, Hino, Tokyo, Japan). Images included T2-weighted (T2W), three-dimensional fast
imaging employing steady-state acquisition (3D-FIESTA) and T1-weighted (T1W) images before and
after intravenous contrast administration (0.1 mmol/kg gadodiamide, Magnevist, Berlex
Laboratories, Wayne, NJ, U.S.A.). The epidural fat was intact, and no evidence of cord
compression was observed. The right-side radial nerve (C8 and T1 spinal nerves) was thickened,
and the caudal brachial plexus was also swollen compared with the left side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>3D-FIESTA transverse magnetic resonance image of the C8 spinal nerve (A), the T1 spinal

thickened, and the caudal brachial plexus (asterisk) was swollen compared with the left
side.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-723-g001"/></fig>). On post-contrast images, lesions were uniformly and slightly hyperintense. Based on
these MRI findings, neoplasia and inflammatory disease were suspected, and histopathological
diagnosis was requested.</p>
    <p>On day 28, the dog showed non-weight-bearing lameness of both forelimbs. It also showed
discomfort on auxiliary palpation. The decrease in the left forelimb was also revealed in the
neurological examination. The cutaneous trunci reflex was not detected on either side (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These neurological results revealed that the
lesion extended at least into the spinal canal. A partial biopsy of the C8 spinal nerve was
thus performed using an approach method [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
    <p>Histologically, neoplastic lymphoid cells proliferated in the endoneurium of the 8th cervical
nerve. The cells had a single nucleus 1 to 1.5 times the diameter of a red blood cell and a
moderate amount of lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig.
2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>The right 8th cervical nerve is replaced by proliferation of neoplastic lymphoid cells.

diffusely-distributed fine chromatin pattern. One to three nucleoli were sometimes observed.
The average number of mitoses in 10 high-power fields using a 40-power objective was 11.1.
Detection of clonal antigen receptor gene rearrangement for the immunoglobulin heavy chain
(IgH) and T cell receptor gamma (TCR &#x3B3;) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) could also be
used to determine lineage of lymphoproliferation. This case had a clonal TCR &#x3B3; gene
rearrangement. Based on the histological findings and clonality assessment, the neoplastic
growth in the present case likely corresponded to T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma
according to the histological classification of hematopoietic tumors in the WHO International
Histological Classification of Tumors of Domestic Animals [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Immunohistochemical examination was performed by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase
complex method (Vectastain Elite ABC Kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, U.S.A.) using
polyclonal antibodies against human CD3 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and human CD20 (LabVision,
Fremont, CA, U.S.A.). A positive reaction for CD3 was detected in the cytoplasm of the
scattered neoplastic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Positive staining for CD3 in the lymphoid cells infiltrating in the right 8th cervical

Immunohistochemistry for human CD3 counterstained with hematoxylin.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-723-g003"/></fig>), and cells positive for CD20 were also distributed in the population, which were
considered to be nonneoplastic B lymphocytes based on the results of the clonality
assessment.</p>
    <p>On day 30, Horner&#x2019;s syndrome was noted in the right eye. However, the dog&#x2019;s general physical
condition was good. On day 32, a CBC and serum biochemistry showed no significant
abnormalities. Administration of oral lomustine (60 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, every 21 days) was
started. On day 39, although the dog&#x2019;s general physical condition was good, it was not
ambulatory. On day 42, postural responses were decreased in not only the forelimbs but also
the pelvic limbs. Orthovoltage X-ray radiation therapy (half value layer: 2.5 mmCu, 4 Gy
fractions on a Monday-Thursday basis) was started. The radiation area was a square field (15 &#xD7;
15 cm) from the C5 to T3 vertebrae, centered on the spinal canal and the caudal brachial
plexus. The lung area was covered with a 2.5-mm lead sheet. On day 45, Horner&#x2019;s syndrome was
noted in both eyes. A micturition disorder became evident, and assisted emptying of the
bladder was performed by manual expulsion. A CBC showed leukocytopenia (1,400
cells/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>; reference range, 5,700 to 16,300 cells/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>) due
to the myelosuppression effect of lomustine. Chemotherapy was halted, and only radiotherapy
was performed. On day 52, the dog developed difficulty in breathing. Respiratory excursions of
the chest were not restricted. The breath sounds were normal. On thoracic radiography, a large
mass with ventral shift of the caudal bronchus was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_004" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>(A) Thoracic radiography demonstrates a large mass with ventral shift of the caudal

precardiac space. The lung lobes show congestive edema.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-723-g004"/></fig>), while there were no abnormalities observed on abdominal radiographs. The radiotherapy
was halted. Although euthanasia was discussed, the owner did not request it.</p>
    <p>The dog died on day 53 and was submitted to pathological examinations with the agreement of
the owner. Grossly, there was a solid white mass, about 6 cm in diameter, at the anterior
mediastinum, which occupied the anterior part of the thoracic cavity and involved the trachea,
esophagus and major vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4B</xref>). The mass
extended backward along the dorsal mediastinum to the diaphragm. The spinal nerves comprising
the right brachial plexus were slightly enlarged and invaded the mass. A white soft tissue was
present within the subdural space at the roots of these spinal nerves. The lungs presented
diffuse congestive edema, and the pleural effusion was lightly sanguineous and opaque and
moderately increased. The pancreas and the both kidneys contained a white nodule about 2 cm in
diameter and multiple white nodules of up to 0.4 cm in diameter, respectively. The abdominal
fluid was mildly increased.</p>
    <p>In the 7th cervical to 1st thoracic spinal cords, the neoplastic cells proliferated in the
extradural adipose tissue and the subdural space and partially invaded the spinal parenchyma.
Additionally, the neoplastic growth was also detected in the endoneurium of the 6th cervical
to 3rd thoracic nerves and dorsal root ganglions of both sides, subarachnoid and Virchow-Robin
spaces of the whole brain, pituitary gland and trigeminal nerves. In the thoracic mass, the
adipose, muscular and peripheral nervous tissues had been destroyed and replaced by the
neoplastic growth. Neoplastic cells invaded the submucosa of the trachea and cranial vena cava
which were involved in the mass. Neoplastic cells were also present in the liver, spleen,
heart base adipose tissue, diaphragm, bone marrow of the rib and nodules in the pancreas and
kidneys.</p>
    <p>Canine neurolymphomatosis is uncommon, and only two reports have been published [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A comparison
of three cases including this case is shown in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table

The immunophenotype of the lymphoma reported by Schaffer <italic>et
al.</italic> was B-cell lymphoma. On the other hand, the present case was T-cell lymphoma.
In the case reported by Pfaff <italic>et al.</italic>, infiltration of neoplastic cells was
confirmed in lymph nodes and bone marrow. On the other hand, neoplastic cell infiltration in
bone marrow was not detected in the case reported by Schaffer <italic>et al.</italic> In the
present case, the neoplastic cell infiltration in bone marrow was confirmed. Although only a
limited amount of data was available, it was thought that the clinical stages (i.e. WHO
Clinical Staging System) of canine neurolymphomatosis were not uniform.</p>
    <p>There are two case reports regarding the presentation and antemortem diagnosis of lymphoma
involving the brachial plexus in two cats [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. One cat was treated by a forelimb amputation, resection
of the mass in the spinal nerve with hemilaminectomy and a multidrug chemotherapy protocol
involving cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone. However, the owners elected
euthanasia because the cat&#x2019;s subsequent quality of life was unacceptable, while the period
from surgical treatment to euthanasia was not described [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In humans, the most effective treatment for brachial plexus lymphoma also
appears to be poorly defined, because primary solitary peripheral nerve lymphoma is
exceedingly rare [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. On the other hand, Misdraji
<italic>et al.</italic> reported four cases of primary lymphoma of the peripheral nerve in
humans. The four patients were treated with aggressive combination chemotherapy, and all
patients experienced an initial response. External beam radiation therapy was given in three
patients. Two patients relapsed at 4 and 19 months and died of lymphoma at 6 and 43 months,
respectively. The other two patients are still alive [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Lymphoma is one of the most chemotherapy-responsive tumors diagnosed in dogs
[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the present case, postoperative metastases
to the liver, pancreas and kidneys were confirmed. Neoplastic tissues were seen extending into
the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord, and a large mass was identified within the caudal
thoracic cavity. Therefore, the lymphoma in the present case was a systemic disease. Surgical
treatment alone has only a limited role in lymphoma, because of the multifocal nature of the
disease [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The present dog was treated with
lomustine (60 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), but no clinical improvement was seen. In the aforementioned
case involving a cat, postoperative chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and
prednisolone was performed; the owners elected euthanasia, because the cat&#x2019;s quality of life
following treatment was unacceptable [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, the
effects of chemotherapy for brachial plexus lymphoma cannot be discussed, because peripheral
nervous system lymphomas have been infrequently reported. Radiotherapy has been demonstrated
to be effective for treating localized lymphoma [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].
The present dog was also treated with orthovoltage X-ray radiation therapy as a local
treatment. However, the dog died on the 11th postoperative day. Therefore, the effects of
radiotherapy for the lymphoma in the brachial plexus cannot be discussed here either.</p>
    <p>In the present case, the dog was treated with a variety of management options based on what
was available at the time of diagnosis and the owner&#x2019;s wishes. Further consideration of the
management strategy for canine neurolymphomatosis is needed.</p>
