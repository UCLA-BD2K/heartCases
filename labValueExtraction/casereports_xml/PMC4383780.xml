        <p>Infective endocarditis (IE) in dogs with cardiac shunts has not been reported previously.
However, we encountered a dog with concurrent patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and IE. The
dog was a 1-year-old, 13.9-kg female Border collie and presented with anorexia, weight
loss, pyrexia (40.4&#xB0;C) and lameness. A continuous murmur with maximal intensity over the
left heart base (Levine 5/6) was detected on auscultation. Echocardiography revealed a PDA
and severe aortic stenosis (AS) caused by aortic-valve vegetative lesions.
<italic>Corynebacterium</italic> spp. and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> were
isolated from blood cultures. The dog responded to aggressive antibiotic therapy, and the
PDA was subsequently surgically corrected. After a series of treatments, the dog showed
long-term improvement in clinical status.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Infective endocarditis (IE) is a rare cardiac disease in which bacterial or fungal infections
cause inflammation of the endocardium. Patients with structural heart disease are predisposed
to IE, and it has been reported that dogs with congenital heart disease involving subaortic
stenosis are also predisposed to the disease [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In
humans, both patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and ventricular septal defect are underlying
factors promoting IE [<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In PDA patients, infection
usually occurs on the endothelium of the ductus arteriosus, pulmonary trunk and left pulmonary
artery, which are exposed to the abnormal blood jet flow caused by the shunt [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, IE
involving not only the ductus arteriosus and pulmonary artery, but also the aortic valve is
extremely rare, even in humans [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In dogs, there is no
known case of IE associated with PDA, although device infection has been reported following
transcutaneous occlusion of PDA in dogs [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Therefore, our case of concurrent PDA and IE is
noteworthy, although no definite relationship between the 2 conditions was elucidated.
Although aortic-valve infection due to IE is associated with a poor prognosis in dogs [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], this particular patient&#x2019;s clinical status improved
after aggressive antibiotic therapy and surgical PDA correction. This novel case is presented
below.</p>
    <p>A 1-year-old intact female Border collie dog, weighing 13.9 kg, was presented to the
referring veterinarian due to a 1-month history of anorexia and vomiting, weight loss
(16.9%/month) and lameness in the right hind limb. Pyrexia on physical examination raised the
suspicion of infection. Empiric antibiotic therapy was initiated, and the clinical status of
the dog improved. However, the dog was then referred to our veterinary hospital at Azabu
University due to continued pyrexia and an existing cardiac murmur that was detected during
puppyhood.</p>
    <p>On physical examination, the patient&#x2019;s body temperature was 38.5&#xB0;C, and heart rate was 112
bpm; however, respiration was rapid (80/min) and labored. Auscultation revealed a continuous
murmur with maximal intensity over the left heart base (Levine 5/6). In addition, bounding
pulses were detected in the femoral arteries and the distal arteries of all 4 limbs, i.e., the
median arteries in the forelimbs and the saphenous arteries in the hind limbs. Thoracic
radiography revealed cardiomegaly; the vertebral heart score was 11.6 vertebrae [v] (reference
range, 9.7 &#xB1; 0.5 v [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]), the pulmonary vessels were
enlarged, and the right caudal lung lobe showed increased opacity. Pulmonary edema was
suspected, and the patient was administered furosemide (1 mg/kg, intravenously [IV]) and
pimobendan (0.36 mg/kg, per os [PO]) and placed in an oxygen cage providing a 40% inspiratory
oxygen fraction. After 2 hr, the respiration was no longer labored, and the respiratory rate
decreased to 52 breaths/min. Electrocardiography revealed a prolonged QRS duration, i.e., 80
msec, but no arrhythmia was detected during the 5-min examination.</p>
    <p>Echocardiography showed left ventricular enlargement, indicated by a normalized left
ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVDd-index) of 2.91 (reference range, 1.27&#x2013;1.85 [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). Contractile dysfunction, indicated by a normalized
left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVDs-index) of 2.13 (reference range, 0.71&#x2013;1.26 [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]) and fractional shortening (FS) of 22.63% (reference
range, &gt;25% [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]), was also observed. Color flow
Doppler showed a left-to-right PDA with a maximal flow velocity of 4.63 m/sec (reference
range, &gt;3.5 m/sec [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]), severe aortic valve
stenosis (AS) with a peak velocity of 5.01 m/sec (reference range, &lt;2 m/sec [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]) and severe aortic regurgitation (AR) extending to the
left ventricular apex. Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed fluttering vegetative lesions
on the aortic valve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Two-dimensional echocardiogram images.Right parasternal long-axis (A) and short-axis
(B) views of the aortic valve. Vegetative lesions (arrow) were most apparent in the
short-axis view, but the vibrating vegetative lesions were observed only in the
long-axis view. Aortic stenosis was caused by vegetative changes in the aortic valve.
Fluttering of the noncoronary cusp (arrowhead) was observed on M-mode imaging of the
aortic valve (C). LA, left atrium; LV, left ventricle; AO, aorta.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-331-g001"/></fig>). A complete blood count showed non-regenerative anemia, indicated by a red blood cell
count of 418.0 &#xD7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>, packed cell volume of 27.7%,
hemoglobin concentration of 9.5 g/d<italic>l</italic> and reticulocyte count of 4.3 &#xD7;
10<sup>4</sup> cells/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>; an elevated white blood cell count (25,750
cells/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>) and neutrophilia (20,460 cells/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>). Biochemical
analysis and coagulation tests including evaluation of fibrin degradation products did not
show any significant abnormalities, although the C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration was
elevated at 18.0 mg/d<italic>l </italic>(reference range, &lt;1.0 mg/d<italic>l</italic>).
Three blood culture samples were aseptically collected in resin-containing blood culturettes
from both jugular veins and the left saphenous vein at 1-hr intervals. The three
5-m<italic>l</italic> samples of blood were each used for aerobic and anaerobic cultures
(HOKENKAGAKUKENKYUUJYO Co., Ltd., Yokohama, Japan). <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> spp. were
isolated from the left jugular vein and left saphenous vein, and <italic>Bacillus
subtilis</italic> was isolated from the right jugular vein. No abnormalities were detected
on urinalysis, and no pathogens were cultured from the urine. Joint fluid from the right
stifle was examined cytologically due to joint swelling and revealed inflammation with
mononuclear cells, although the bacterial culture yielded negative results. Radiography of the
right stifle showed periarticular swelling. Factors predisposing the patients to sustained
bacteremia, e.g., diabetes mellitus, discitis, periodontal disease, pyoderma, abscess caused
by bite or scratch wounds and immune-suppressing drugs, were not detected.</p>
    <p>The dog was diagnosed with left-to-right PDA and with severe AS and AR due to aortic valve
IE. The dog was hospitalized due to congestive heart failure, and aggressive antibiotic and
heart failure therapy was initiated. Pimobendan (0.36 mg/kg, PO, q 12 hr), enalapril maleate
(0.36 mg/kg, PO, q 12 hr) and furosemide (1 mg/kg, IV, q 12 hr) were administered to treat the
heart failure. Cefazolin (22 mg/kg, IV, q 8 hr) and enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg, subcutaneously
[SC], q 24 hr), which were initially prescribed empirically at the first presentation, were
continued, because both <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> spp. and <italic>Bacillus
subtilis</italic> were sensitive to cefazolin and quinolones according to the results of
antibiotic susceptibility testing. The pathogens were also sensitive to ampicillin,
penicillin, cefotaxime, cefdinir, cefepime, imipenem, erythromycin, minocycline, amikacin,
vancomycin and gentamycin. Famotidine (0.5 mg/kg, IV, q 12 hr) was used to treat vomiting, and
heparin (100 IU/kg, SC, q 12 hr) was used to prevent disseminated intravascular clotting.
Intravenous catheters were replaced every 5 to 7 days according to the status of the catheter
insertion site.</p>
    <p>At 2 days after presentation at our institution, the patient showed significant clinical
improvement; her activity and appetite completely recovered at 3 days. At 10 days, the
furosemide was switched from parenteral to oral administration and the dose reduced (1.1
mg/kg, PO, q 24 hr), because her clinical status was excellent. At 16 days, the patient&#x2019;s body
temperature was 38.2&#xB0;C, and the anemia and neutrophilia had resolved. Blood culture of samples
from the jugular vein and left saphenous vein was repeated and yielded negative results.
Famotidine was discontinued, because the anorexia and vomiting had resolved. Echocardiography
showed that the peak velocity of the AS was 4.88 m/sec. The peak velocity and pressure half
time (PHT) of the AR were 2.85 m/sec and 111.8 msec, respectively. The low diastolic pressure
due to PDA and AR was suspected because of the low gradient pressure between the aorta and the
left ventricle in diastole, although the beam/flow angle was inadequate. At 20 days, heparin
was discontinued, because the CRP concentration had significantly decreased (2.25
mg/d<italic>l</italic>).</p>
    <p>At 21 days, the patient underwent surgical ligation of the ductus arteriosus. General
anesthesia was induced with fentanyl (10 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/kg, IV), midazolam (0.2 mg/kg,
IV) and propofol (1&#x2013;2 mg/kg, IV) and maintained with fentanyl (5 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/kg/hr,
constant-rate infusion [CRI]) and isoflurane (1.5&#x2013;2.0% in 100% oxygen). Thoracotomy was
performed via the left fourth intercostal space. For ductus arteriosus ligation, the standard
dissection technique was selected instead of the Jackson and Henderson dissection (JH) method,
because the ductus arteriosus was enlarged as a result of tubular aneurysm formation, and the
heart size was too large to allow isolation of the dorsal descending aorta. In addition, the
descending aorta was beating strongly due to the significant bounding pulse. The ductus
arteriosus was closed with 1&#x2013;0 silk and surgical silk tape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Surgeon&#x2019;s view of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) ligation. The PDA was large, because
of tubular aneurism (asterisk) formation. In addition, the vessels were strongly
beating, because of the bounding pulse due to the PDA and aortic regurgitation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-331-g002"/></fig>). The remaining thoracic musculature, subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed
routinely, and the dog recovered uneventfully from general anesthesia. Fentanyl (2
<italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/kg/hr, CRI) provided analgesia for 24 hr postoperatively. The dog
remained in an oxygen cage (40% inspired oxygen) for 2 days postoperatively due to a low
percutaneous oxygen saturation measurement of 94%. The heart failure therapy and parenteral
antibiotic therapy were continued postoperatively. Echocardiography was repeated immediately
postoperatively and showed the disappearance of the PDA; however, the AS and AR remained and
showed peak velocities of 3.96 m/sec and 6.25 m/sec, respectively. The PHT of the AR was 100.0
msec.</p>
    <p>At 33 days after presentation at our institution, echocardiography was repeated to elucidate
the cause of the persistent bounding pulses and the to-and-fro murmur on auscultation, which
had a maximal intensity over the left heart base (Levine 3/6). Echocardiography revealed a
slight residual shunt through the ductus arteriosus; furthermore, the echocardiographic
parameters had worsened from their preoperative values. The LA/Ao pre- and postoperatively
were 1.45 and 1.78, respectively; the pre- and postoperative LVDd-index and LVDs-index values
were respectively 2.91 and 3.23 and 2.13 and 2.29. However, the aortic flow velocity had
decreased to 3.66 m/sec. The vegetative lesions on the aortic valve cusps had disappeared on
2-dimensional echocardiography; however, the cusps were deformed and highly echogenic. At 34
days after presentation, the blood pressure was measured as 153 mmHg using the Doppler method.
Parenteral antibiotic therapy was discontinued, because the dog was bright and had no clinical
symptoms associated with infection, and she was discharged. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (18
mg/kg, PO, q 12 hr) was administered for 10 days after discharge from hospital. Pimobendan
(0.36 mg/kg, PO, q 12 hr), enalapril maleate (0.36 mg/kg, PO, q 12 hr) and furosemide (1.1
mg/kg, PO, as needed according to respiratory rate) were used to manage the heart failure.</p>
    <p>At 44 days after presentation at our institution, the dog returned due to swelling of the
dorsal cervical skin. However, the site of the swelling appeared to match the position where
enrofloxacin had been repeatedly administered. The dog was also coughing 3 to 4 times daily,
although her clinical status was excellent. Thoracic radiography revealed cardiomegaly
(VHS=11.9 v) and enlarged pulmonary veins without pulmonary edema. On echocardiography, the
left ventricular diameter was decreased (LVDd-index=3.11) compared to the value at 33 days,
and the left ventricular contractility had improved (LVDs-index=1.96 and FS=33.5%) compared to
the values at first presentation and at 33 days. However, the aortic flow velocity had
increased to 4.51 m/sec, perhaps because the contractility of the left ventricle improved.
Typically, a severe AS is treated with atenolol due to its negative inotropic and
anti-arrhythmic effects, but the AS was not treated in this case because the left ventricular
contractility was insufficient. AR extended to the left ventricular apex and was observed at
the same level as that before surgery. The AR peak velocity was 4.6 m/sec and the PHT 159.4
msec. There was a risk of further worsening of the AS with use of an afterload reducer, but we
elected to administer amlodipine at a low dosage (0.1 mg/kg q 24 hr) and increase it gradually
to 0.2 mg/kg q 12 hr while monitoring the blood pressure because the benefit of decreasing the
AR was deemed to outweigh the risk of AS deterioration.</p>
    <p>At 91 days after presentation, the LVDd-index and LVDs-index decreased to 2.97 and 1.85,
respectively, compared to those at 44 days after presentation. In addition, the LA/Ao
decreased from its postoperative value of 1.78 to 1.27. However, the AS peak velocity
increased further to 4.39 m/sec compared to that at 44 days after presentation. The AR peak
velocity and PHT were 4.95 m/sec and 224.08 msec, respectively. The dog was in excellent
clinical status, and the owner was satisfied with the outcome.</p>
    <p>The prevalence of IE in dogs is low at 0.09&#x2013;0.6%, but it may be underestimated, because dogs
with IE display nonspecific clinical signs, and diagnosis is difficult. IE lesions diagnosed
postmortem may not be visible on echocardiography [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. IE is associated with damaged endocardium and/or
endothelium and sustained bacteremia. Predisposing factors of IE in dogs are diabetes mellitus
[<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], discitis, pneumonia, infective arthritis,
prostatitis, periodontal disease, urinary infection, pyoderma, abscess formation at bite or
scratch wounds, congenital heart disease, central venous catheter placement and the use of
immune-suppressing drugs [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this report, the dog had PDA, which is a predisposing factor in
humans [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, there are no cases of concurrent
IE and PDA in previous reports describing PDA in 520 dogs [<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], in 170 dogs with PDA that presented at our university from 1999 to 2009
(unpublished data) or in 71 dogs with IE [<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In
veterinary medicine, only dogs with subaortic stenosis appear to be at a high risk of IE
[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The most common sites of infection are the
ductus arteriosus, pulmonary artery trunk and left pulmonary artery, which, in humans with
PDA, are exposed to abnormal jet flow due to the cardiac shunt; aortic-valve infection is
extremely rare, even in humans with PDA [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. IE may
occur at the aortic valve in dogs with subaortic stenosis, because jet flow damages the
endocardium of the aortic valve [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Reportedly,
dogs with PDA may have high aortic velocity (up to 3.75 m/s) due to volume overload [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This high
aortic velocity following volume overload in PDA may damage the aortic valve endocardium. The
dog in this report may have underlying aortic stenosis; however, the existence of congenital
aortic stenosis cannot be confirmed by antemortem diagnosis, because the pathologic changes in
the aortic valve following IE do not completely resolve with antibiotic therapy in all dogs
with IE [<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition, small vegetative lesions
that could not be visualized by echocardiography may have existed on the endothelium of the
ductus arteriosus and/or the pulmonary artery in this case. Indeed, IE lesions that were not
detected by echocardiography were later diagnosed by necropsy in dogs [<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although the left ventricular side of the aortic valve should have IE
in cases of turbulent flow at the left ventricular outflow, because the ventricular side of
the aortic valve was exposed to the jet flow in this dog, the opposite side of aortic valve
instead showed IE on echocardiography. The exact location of IE lesions is unclear without
postmortem diagnosis [<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], but a vegetative lesion
originating from the left ventricular side of the aortic valve may extend distally due to
blood flow.</p>
    <p>Sustained bacteremia following infective arthritis or urinary infection is suspected in this
case; however, bacterial cultures showed negative results for both joint fluid and urine
samples, although they might have been false-negative results due to the antibiotic therapy.
The lameness may have been due to deposition of immune complexes in response to the bacteremia
[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] as the distal artery of the lame right hind limb
was palpable, which is not observed in dogs with septic thromboembolism [<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The presence of <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> spp. may reflect
contamination in this dog, because it was isolated from only 2 of 3 blood cultures; however,
in humans, it has been reported that 80% of bacteremic episodes were detected with the first
culture, 88% with the first 2 cultures and 99% with 3 cultures when blood was sampled in
sequence [<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, it was unnecessary for all 3
samples to test positive, and <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> spp. may in fact have been the
cause of IE in this dog. <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> spp. inhabit the skin and mucous
membranes of humans and animals [<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore,
periodontal disease, pyoderma and abscess formation at bite or scratch wounds may cause IE,
although these events did not occur in the present report. <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>
was also isolated from blood culture in this dog. <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> is a soil
bacterium and is a common cause of pseudobacteremia following contamination [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], but it is
considered a rare cause of IE in humans [<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Whether
<italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> was the cause of IE is unclear in this case, but
regardless, it was sensitive to the antibiotics that were administered.</p>
    <p>A lower respiratory infection may also have been the cause of sustained bacteremia, because
the dog continued to cough after heart failure therapy was initiated. However,
<italic>Corynebacterium</italic> spp. and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> have not been
reported as pathogenic organisms in lower respiratory infections [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The origin of the sustained bacteremia could not be identified in this
dog, but it is reportedly difficult to confirm the origin of bacteremia in dogs with IE [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Immune deficiency is another potential trigger [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; however, infection did not recur in this dog after she
recovered from the IE. In dogs, <italic>Staphylococc</italic>us spp.,
<italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp., <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>,
<italic>Bartonella</italic> spp. and <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> spp. are reported
pathogens in IE [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These organisms are not isolated by blood culture in 60&#x2013;70% of dogs with IE
[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In
this case, the pathogenic organism was isolated from the blood despite antibiotic use prior to
blood culture, perhaps because resin-containing blood culturettes were used. The blood
cultures were collected from the veins only in this dog, because a large volume could be
easily withdrawn, but it is preferable to collect blood from the arteries, such as the aortic
or mitral valve, especially in dogs with pathologic lesions following left-heart IE. However,
in humans, arterial blood cultures were not associated with higher diagnostic yields than
venous blood cultures [<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. There are no established
antibiotic therapeutic protocols for IE, but intravenous antibiotic therapy for 1 to 2 weeks
followed by oral administration for 6 to 8 weeks has been empirically performed in dogs [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The dog in this report received parenteral antibiotics
for 33 days based on the antibiotic susceptibility test results, similar to the protocol in
humans with IE. However, alternative methods employing oral or subcutaneous antibiotic
administration [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] at home should be considered in cases
with financial restrictions.</p>
    <p>Ductus arteriosus closure was difficult to justify in this case, because dogs with aortic
valve infection due to IE have a very poor prognosis; the median survival time is only 3 days
[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, the decision was made to proceed with
ductus arteriosus closure in this case, because (1) the clinical status significantly improved
after aggressive antibiotic therapy, (2) humans with PDA reportedly have a high risk of IE
[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], (3) only 36% of dogs with PDA survive to 1 year
of age [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and (4) untreated PDA has a poor prognosis
in dogs [<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, the dog in this report had
no negative survival factors previously reported in dogs with IE, such as thrombocytopenia,
elevated serum creatinine concentration, renal dysfunction and thromboembolism [<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The ductus arteriosus was surgically ligated rather
than closed with a device, because ductus arteriosus-closure devices increase the risk of
infection [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, a slight residual shunt through the ductus arteriosus was observed
after surgery. It has been reported that a residual shunt occurs in 35.3% of dogs that undergo
ductus arteriosus ligation, particularly with the JH method [<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the JH method, entrapment of loose connective tissue within the medial
aspect of the ligature results in recanalization of the PDA [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In this case, the shunt flow through
the PDA initially disappeared immediately after ductus arteriosus closure, but the residual
shunt was observed 12 days postoperatively. The recanalization of the PDA was caused by the
entrapment of loose connective tissue within the medial aspect of the ligature due to the
large size of the ductus arteriosus. However, this may reflect our technical limitation,
because the standard dissection technique was utilized for PDA ligation in this case. Namely,
the PDA may not have been completely ligated in this case, because the PDA had become a large
tubular aneurysm with a bounding pulse in the ductus vessels due to the PDA and AR.</p>
    <p>The risk of IE disappears after PDA closure in humans [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and dogs with residual PDA shunts do not develop IE [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In addition, residual shunts occur in 14% of humans within 6 months
after transcutaneous occlusion of PDA. IE associated with residual PDA shunts is extremely
rare [<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; therefore, residual shunts appear not to
require additional treatment in dogs unless there are negative hemodynamic effects, which may
have been the case in this dog. The dog was doing well clinically, but the echocariographic
parameters worsened postoperatively. Potentially, the dog in this report may have developed
acute AS and AR following IE, which then decreased the left ventricular compliance. That the
improved clinical status was inversely related to the echocardiographic parameters likely
reflected the compensatory mechanisms of heart failure during treatment [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. AS remained moderate to severe after initiating treatment for PDA; it
may have improved postoperatively due to the siginificantly decreased volume overload
following ductus arteriosus occlusion [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] or improvement
of the aortic valve structure after beginning antibiotic treatment [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Severe AS is treated with
atenolol, surgical correction or baloon valvulopasty; however, in the present case, the AS was
not treated due to insufficient contractility in the left ventricle, the history of IE and the
lack of any benefit to sugical correction [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or
balloon valvuloplasty [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The AR was medically
treated with amlodipine, because the afterload reduction may reduce the AR severity [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the afterload reduction may worsen AS, though
the AS severity did not siginificantly change in this particular case after administering
amlodipine. The PDA was ligated with non-absorbable surgical braided ligature and tape,
because the braided ligatures were stronger than monofilament ligatures, a factor that appears
to be essential for ligation of the large ductus arteriosus. However, braided sutures are not
recommended for ductus arteriosus ligation, especially in dogs with IE, because the material
is more prone to infection than are monofilament sutures [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
    <p>Although reverse remodeling is usually observed in dogs that undergo PDA occlusion [<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], there was no improvement in cardiac size after
surgical correction of the PDA in the present case. Factors that may adversely affect reverse
remodeling include older age at PDA closure, myocardium failure following long-term volume
overload and residual shunt [<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, it has
been reported in humans that AR may occur after ductus arteriosus occlusion due to
disappearance of the large shunt flow and geometric changes in the aortic root [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In dogs with PDA, the increased diastolic pressure in
the aorta following ductus arteriosus closure may worsen AR [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The AR may have worsened postoperatively in this case, because the AR peak
velocity was extremely high and its PHT was short at immediately after surgery. Therefore, the
worsened AR may have hindered reverse remodeling. The left ventricular diameter gradually
decreased postoperatively, perhaps because the AR improved, indicated by the decreased peak
velocity and increased PHT of AR. However, the significant reduction in shunt flow following
ductus arteriosus closure may also be important in promoting reverse remodeling as the LA
enlargement was completely resolved postoperatively.</p>
    <p>PDA is one of the most common congenital heart diseases in dogs. In humans, PDA patients have
a high risk of IE, which significantly decreases or disappears after complete or incomplete
PDA occlusion [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In addition, aortic-valve infection is extremely rare, even in humans with PDA.
Aortic-valve infection due to IE has a poor prognosis in dogs. However, PDA correction should
be decided according to the clinical status and response to medical treatment. Indeed, despite
the presence of a slight residual PDA shunt, the dog in this report showed excellent clinical
outcomes on long-term follow-up after PDA correction without recurrence of the IE or heart
failure. There is no known previous report of a dog with concurrent PDA and IE, despite the
reported risk of IE in dogs with PDA. This is the first report describing a dog with
concurrent PDA and IE; however, the relationship between PDA and IE was not confirmed. Any
association should be confirmed on postmortem examination as in humans, ductus arteriosus and
left pulmonary artery lesions commonly affected by IE [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] could not be detected by
echocardiography [<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
