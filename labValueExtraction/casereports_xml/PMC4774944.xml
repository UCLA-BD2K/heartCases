    <p>Patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) of a classical phenotype present within the first year of life with life-threatening infections and failure to thrive.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The X-linked T<sup>&#x2212;</sup>B<sup>+</sup> natural killer (NK)<sup>&#x2212;</sup> form of SCID is the most frequent type (44% to 46%) and is a consequence of mutations in the IL-2 receptor &#x3B3; <italic>(IL2RG)</italic> gene (OMIM 308380), which encodes the common cytokine receptor &#x3B3; chain (&#x3B3;c).<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> The &#x3B3;c acts as a signal-transducing subunit of cytokine receptors that are essential in the ontogeny and function of T, B, and NK cells, namely IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. The intracellular part of &#x3B3;c interacts with Janus kinase 3 and mediates phosphorylation and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins, which regulate induction of gene transcription.</p>
    <p>A number of patients with a milder form of combined immunodeficiency, often termed &#x201C;leaky&#x201D; or &#x201C;hypomorphic&#x201D; SCID, have been described. Here we describe 2 male relatives with a novel hypomorphic mutation in the <italic>IL2RG</italic> promoter who presented with a phenotype more akin to common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). CVID is the most common clinically and genetically heterogeneous primary immunodeficiency, which is characterized by low IgG, IgA, and/or IgM levels, with a failure to produce specific antibodies.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Mutations in genes encoding transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI), inducible costimulator (ICOS), CD19, CD20, CD21, CD81, LRBA, CXCR4, NF-&#x3BA;B2, B&#xA0;cell&#x2013;activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF) receptor, TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase catalytic subunit &#x3B4; polypeptide (PI3KCD), and PI3KR1 were shown to cause CVID-like phenotypes.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p>
    <p>The grandson presented at age 4&#xA0;years with a history of recurrent bacterial otitis media and chronic suppurative rhinitis, rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis (age 18&#xA0;months), echoviral gastroenteritis (age 2&#xA0;years), and varicella zoster (age 4&#xA0;years). He had IgG deficiency (1.8&#xA0;g/L) with normal IgA and IgM levels (1.0 and 0.5&#xA0;g/L, respectively) and did not mount an adequate response to the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax; Merck &amp; Co, Whitehouse Station, NJ), although he responded appropriately to immunization with protein antigens (see <xref rid="tblE1" ref-type="table">Table E1</xref> in this article's Online Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jacionline.org" id="intref0010">www.jacionline.org</ext-link>). He had normal numbers of T and B&#xA0;cells but completely absent NK cells. T-cell proliferation after stimulation with PHA, anti-CD3, and <italic>Candida</italic> species was suboptimal but not completely abrogated. He was started on immunoglobulin replacement therapy and is well, with his infections limited to recalcitrant cutaneous warts.</p>
    <p>At the time of his diagnosis, it was noted that his maternal grandfather was under treatment for CVID. The grandfather presented to an immunology team at the age of 34&#xA0;years with a 20-year history of recurrent otosinopulmonary tract infections with <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, bronchiectasis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus and celiac disease. On initial presentation, he had an IgG<sub>2</sub> and IgG<sub>4</sub> subclass deficiency, absent antibody response to polysaccharide vaccine, CD4 and NK lymphopenia, and reduced proliferative responses to PHA. Immunoglobulin substitution was implemented, along with antibiotic prophylaxis, and he was managed successfully on this regimen for 25&#xA0;years until he died at age 62&#xA0;years after a cardiac event.</p>
    <p>Flow cytometric analysis of lymphocytes revealed a significantly diminished &#x3B3;c expression in both the grandson and grandfather (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, <italic>A</italic>; see the Methods section in this article's Online Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jacionline.org" id="interref0010">www.jacionline.org</ext-link>). Likewise, <italic>IL2RG</italic> mRNA expression in sorted T and B&#xA0;cells from the grandson showed a 4.2-fold reduction in T&#xA0;cells and a 33-fold reduction in B&#xA0;cells compared with healthy control subjects (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, <italic>B</italic>). The T cells were then stimulated with IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15, and phosphorylated STAT5 levels were determined by means of flow cytometric analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, <italic>C</italic>). This was diminished in the patient with a fold reduction compared with healthy control samples of 3.5-, 7.5-, and 3.8-fold for IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15, respectively.</p>
    <p>X-inactivation studies performed on samples from the mother of the grandson demonstrated random X-inactivation in whole blood but apparent nonrandom X-inactivation in T&#xA0;cells (see <xref rid="tblE2" ref-type="table">Table E2</xref> in this article's Online Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jacionline.org" id="intref0015">www.jacionline.org</ext-link>). Whole-exome sequencing of the grandson revealed a point mutation, C to T at position g.chrX:71,111,618 (GRCh38), which was located &#x2212;13 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site in the <italic>IL2RG</italic> gene (ENST00000374202; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, <italic>D</italic>). This is situated at an identified binding site for the transcription factor ETS, which is required for basal promoter activity in cell lines.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p>
    <p>For functional validation, we generated the same mutation in an <italic>IL2RG</italic> minigene (Mut.gcPRO and WT.gcPRO), and using a lentiviral vector, introduced this into &#x3B3;c-deficient ED7R&#xA0;cells. We found that &#x3B3;c expression from Mut.gcPRO was dramatically abrogated when compared with the wild-type sequence in a dose-dependent manner. When transduced at similar efficiency (similar vector copy numbers), there is an 8-fold difference in &#x3B3;c expression between the WT-gcPRO and Mut-gcPRO transduced cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, <italic>E</italic>). To confirm that the mutation abrogated binding of ETS, using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we showed that mutant oligonucleotides were unable to form a normal protein/DNA complex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).</p>
    <p>More than 100 mutations in <italic>IL2RG</italic> have been described extending across all of its 8 exons, intron/exon boundaries, and 3&#x2032; regulatory regions.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Although most of the known mutations result in a classical immunophenotype of T<sup>&#x2212;</sup>B<sup>+</sup>NK<sup>&#x2212;</sup> SCID, variants leading to a T<sup>&#x2212;</sup>B<sup>+</sup>NK<sup>+</sup> SCID and T<sup>low</sup>B<sup>+</sup>NK<sup>+</sup> have been described.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Attenuated SCID phenotypes have also been observed as a result of splice-site mutations resulting in diminished expression of truncated &#x3B3;c protein or as a result of somatic reversion.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
    <p>Here we identified a novel point mutation at nucleotide &#x2212;13 upstream of the transcription start site in a putative ETS-binding site.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> ETS transcription factors comprise a large evolutionarily conserved family characterized by sequence homology within their DNA-binding domain that bind to sequences containing a consensus GGAA/T motif.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> The ETS transcription factors have been linked with diverse biological processes, including hematopoiesis, T-cell survival, and NK cell production.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Previous studies have shown that an ETS-binding site in a 1053-bp fragment 5&#x2032; to the <italic>IL2RG</italic> transcription initiation site is essential for tissue-specific basal promoter activity of <italic>IL2RG</italic>.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p>
    <p>Our data indicate that a point mutation within the ETS-binding site of the proximal <italic>IL2RG</italic> promoter has a significant detrimental effect on its activity in human subjects. The residual expression of &#x3B3;c appears to differentially affect signaling through the cytokine receptors leading to normal T-cell development, with minimal reduction in T-cell function and absent NK cell development. In this family this resulted in an initial presentation akin to CVID, manifesting with recurrent bacterial and viral infections. This scenario should be considered in male patients with antibody deficiency, particularly if accompanied by NK lymphopenia. These patients should also be monitored closely for more serious manifestations because this defect is amenable to correction by means of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or gene therapy. Furthermore, our finding highlights the potential role of mutations in gene regulatory regions as a cause of significant primary immunodeficiencies.</p>

          <title>Cell separation from peripheral blood cells</title>
          <p>A subset of T and B cells from control and patient samples were obtained by incubating PBMCs with anti-CD3 and anti-CD19 antibodies conjugated with magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Surrey, United Kingdom).

          <p>Total RNA was extracted from sorted T and B&#xA0;cells by using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was synthesized with the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen). First, RNA (100&#xA0;ng) was incubated with genomic DNA Wipeout Buffer at 42&#xB0;C for 5&#xA0;minutes. Then Reverse Transcription master mix containing RT primer and Quantiscript Reverse Transcriptase (Qiagen) was added to the RNA. The reaction was then incubated for 15&#xA0;minutes at 42&#xB0;C, followed by 3&#xA0;minutes at 95&#xB0;C to inactive reverse transcriptase.</p>

          <title>Real-time quantitative PCR</title>
          <p>Quantitative PCR was performed with an ABI 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, United Kingdom). The primer sequences for <italic>IL2RG</italic> were as follows: forward, 5-TGCTAAAACTGCAGAATCTGGT -3; reverse, 5-AGCTGGGATTCACTCAGTTTG-3. The <italic>IL2RG</italic> probe sequence was 5-CCTGGGCTCCAGAGAACCTAACA-TAMRA-3. The primer sequences for the human &#x3B2;-actin gene were as follows: forward, 5-TCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTACGA-3; reverse, 5-CAGCGGAACCGCTCATTGCCAATGG-3. The &#x3B2;-actin probe sequence was 5-FAM-ATGCCCTCCCCCATGCCA TCCTGCGT-TAMRA-3. The average cycle threshold (Ct) values for <italic>IL2RG</italic> from quantitative PCR were normalized with the average Ct value of &#x3B2;-actin to give rise to the &#x394;Ct, which is used to calculate the &#x394;&#x394;Ct value. Then the 2<sup>&#x2212;&#x394;&#x394;Ct</sup> values for healthy control subjects and patients were deduced from the &#x394;&#x394;Ct value. Quantitative PCR was run in duplicates in 3 independent experiments. Two different controls were used.</p>

        <p>The mutant <italic>IL2RG</italic> promoter was generated by using the QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, Wokingham, Berkshire, United Kingdom). The lentiviral vector containing the wild-type <italic>IL2RG</italic> promoter driving codon optimized <italic>IL2RG</italic> (lenti-gcPRO.gc.co)<xref rid="bibE1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>E1</sup></xref> was used as the parental sequence. The primer sequences used in PCR were as follows: forward, 5-ggttctttccactggaagctatgacag-3; reverse, 5-ctgtcatagcttccagtggaaagaacc-3. The PCR reaction was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR product was then incubated with <italic>Dpn</italic>I enzyme at 37&#xB0;C for 5&#xA0;minutes to digest parental plasmid DNA. Digested PCR product of 2&#xA0;&#x3BC;L was transformed into XL10-Gold cells provided within the kit, according to the protocol. The plasmids prepared from single colonies were then sequenced to confirm introduction of the point mutation within the <italic>IL2RG</italic> promoter and to obtain the lenti-mut.gcPRO.gc.co construct.</p>

          <p>ED7R cells derived from an adult human T-cell leukemia line deficient in <italic>IL2RG</italic> gene expression were cultured in RPMI 1640 plus 10% FCS. The cells were seeded into 12-well plates (10<sup>5</sup>&#xA0;cells/well) and transduced with the lenti-gcPRO.gc.co or lenti-MutgcPRO.gc.co viruses at different multiplicities of infection. On day 3 after transduction, half of the transduced cells were resuspended in 100&#xA0;&#x3BC;L of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (0.5% BSA/PBS) containing 0.5&#xA0;&#x3BC;L of anti&#x2013;human IL2RG (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif) and incubated for 30&#xA0;minutes at 4&#xB0;C. The cells were then washed with FACS buffer, and <italic>IL2RG</italic> expression was analyzed by using FACS. Half of the transduced cells were pelleted for extraction of genomic DNA, and the vector copy numbers were determined by using quantitative PCR, as described above. The housekeeping gene albumin was used as the internal reference gene. The primers/probes used for the lentivirus vector is the same as the above. The primers for the human albumin gene were as follows: forward, 5-GCT GCT ATC TCT TGT GGG CTG T; reverse, 5-ACT CAT GGG AGC TGC TGG TTC. The albumin probe was 5&#x2032;-VIC-CCT GTC ATG CCC ACA CAA ATC TCT CC-TAMRA-3.</p>

        <p>Nuclear proteins were extracted from Jurkat and ED7R&#xA0;cells by using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Mass), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted nuclear proteins were then placed in aliquots and stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C. A&#xA0;38-bp oligonucleotide was chosen from the <italic>IL2RG</italic> promoter covering the Ets-binding region with the following sequences: wild-type, 5&#x2032; ATA AGG TTC TTT CCA CCG GAA GCT ATG ACA GAG GAA AC; mutant, 5&#x2032;&#xA0;ATA AGG TTC TTT CCA CTG GAA GCT ATG ACA GAG GAA AC. The&#xA0;oligonucleotides were synthesized and HPLC purified by Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif). Biotin labeling of the oligonucleotides was performed by using the Biotin 3&#x2032; End DNA Labeling Kit (Thermo Scientific), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled oligonucleotides were purified with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. An equal molar-labeled sense and antisense oligonucleotide was annealed in 10&#xA0;mmol/L Tris, 1&#xA0;mmol/L EDTA, and 50&#xA0;mmol/L NaCl at 95&#xB0;C for 5&#xA0;minutes and then &#x2212;1&#xB0;C/cycle down to 59&#xB0;C, followed for 30&#xA0;minutes at 59&#xB0;C, and then &#x2212;1&#xB0;C/cycle down to 20&#xB0;C in the thermocycler.

        <title>Whole-exome sequencing</title>
        <p>Library preparation, exome capture, and sequencing have been done according to the manufacturers' instructions. For exome target enrichment, the Agilent SureSelect 50&#xA0;Mb kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, Calif) was used. Sequencing was done with the Illumina HiSeq with 94-bp paired-end reads. Reads from raw FASTQ files were aligned to the hg19 reference genome by using NovoAlign, version 2.08.03 (Novocraft Technologies, Selangor, Malaysia). Duplicate reads were marked with picard tools mark duplicates. Calling was performed with the haplotype caller module of GATK (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk" id="intref0020">https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk</ext-link>), creating gVCF formatted files for each sample. The individual gVCF files were combined into gVCF files containing 100 samples each. The final variant calling was performed with the GATK &#x201C;GenotypegVCFs&#x201D; module used jointly for all patients and control subjects. Variant quality scores were then recalibrated according to GATK best practices separately for indels and single nucleotide polymorphisms.
