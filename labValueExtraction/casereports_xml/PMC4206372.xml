    <p>A 43-year-old male patient presented with a complaint of palpitation. Electrocardiography
revealed premature ventricular contraction (PVC) that appeared to be originating from the
left ventricular outflow tract. Tall positive R waves were observed in leads II, III, and
aVF, and the R transition was observed at V2 in precordial leads. A notch was realized on
the downward deflection of QS, which was only at lead V1. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>) This finding indicates that the region between the right and left
coronary commissures is the origin of VPS. In addition, 24-h Holter monitoring revealed
32000 PVCs. Therefore, an electrophysiology study was planned. During the procedure, the
catheter was moved between the right coronary and left coronary commissures, and the
ablation catheter was placed at the ventricular side of the commissures where the earliest
signal recorded was at 40 ms. At this site, pacing produced 12/12 morphology with PVC. In
addition, at this site, we demonstrated a deflection prior to the intracardiac ventricular
electrogram of PVCs corresponding to the notch. This deflection was after the intracardiac
ventricular electrogram during sinus beats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure
1</xref>). Ablation was performed at 20 watt 45 degrees, and it terminated all PVCs at this
site.</p>

    <p>PVCs can be very disturbing in some patients, and medical treatment may be tried. Long-term
impacts of PVC may be deleterious for systolic ventricular function. Ablation of culprit
source of PVC is an effective treatment and may improve systolic function of the left
ventricle. Our patient was on a long-term medical treatment that failed to terminate PVCs.
We preferred ablation for treatment. In this case, we would like to mention that ECG is an
important, simple, cheap, and widely available tool that can be used for localization.</p>
