        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>Seven reticulated giraffes
were hand-reared at Nogeyama Zoological Gardens, because the dam had agalactia. Six of the
7 calves exhibited polyarthritis and/or phlegmon in the lower legs. However, the cause of
the disorder was unclear. The present study reviewed the clinical records of the 7
giraffes, including the type and amount of colostrum ingested during the first 72 hr. The
disorder involved the fetlocks and carpal and tarsal joints in 6 of the 7 calves within an
average of 8 days of birth. The average amount of fed bovine or powdered colostrum was
0&#x2013;2.4 <italic>l</italic> in the first 24 hr and 2.0&#x2013;6.2 <italic>l</italic> during the
first 72 hr. Insufficient colostrum quantity might be a factor in polyarthritis and/or
phlegmon.</p>

  <body>
    <p>A reticulated giraffe (<italic>Giraffa camelopardalis reticulata</italic>) pair at Nogeyama
Zoological Gardens produced 7 calves between 2003 and 2012. The dam failed to produce milk,
and all the calves were hand-reared. Six of the 7 calves exhibited polyarthritis and/or
phlegmon in the lower legs at an early stage after birth. However, the cause of the disorder
was unclear. Although 2 cases of polyarthritis in the giraffe have been reported [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], to the best of
our knowledge, there is no report on multiple cases and the possible cause in the early stages
after birth. In this study, we reviewed all clinical records and the amount of fed colostrum,
and found that insufficient colostrum might be a risk factor for polyarthritis and/or
phlegmon.</p>
    <p>All 7 calves that were produced by the same giraffe pair at Nogeyama Zoological Gardens
between 2003 and 2012 were included in the present study.</p>
    <p>The clinical records of the 7 calves were reviewed. We recorded the date of birth, age when
symptoms of polyarthritis and/or phlegmon first appeared, location (s) of the lesion (s),
duration of symptoms, outcome and treatment methods. In addition, radiographic examination was
performed in 2 calves, and blood testing was conducted in 1 calf. Moreover, average
temperature of the month when each calf was born was obtained from the web site of the Japan
Meteorological Agency (http://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/index.php).</p>
    <p>Regarding colostrum, we reviewed the type, feeding method, and amount administered during the
first 72 hr. The colostrum was either bovine colostrum or a powdered colostrum (Saisyo no
milk; JA Zen-Noh, Tokyo, Japan); a milk replacer (Hotto milk; Nippon Formula Feed
Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Yokohama, Japan) was used after colostrum feeding. The bovine
colostrum was obtained from a neighboring dairy farmer, and the number of days postpartum at
the time when the colostrum would have been obtained was unknown, thereby resulting in
variable and unknown immunoglobulin concentrations. The powdered colostrum and milk replacer
were diluted according to the manufacturers&#x2019; instructions.</p>

symptoms, outcome and average temperature of the month of birth. The clinical outline of each
calf follows.</p>
    <p>Calf no. 1 suckled the dam continually and was considered to have ingested sufficient
colostrum and milk. However, the calf was found in a moribund state at 4 days of age. At this
point, it was recognized that the dam was displaying agalactia or producing only a limited
quantity of milk. The calf was first treated with intensive care and then given bovine
colostrum manually from 8 days of age. The calf survived, but at 11 days, the fetlock of the
left hind limb displayed swelling. Indomethacin (Inteban ointment 1%; Dainippon Sumitomo
Pharma Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) was applied to the joint. The fetlock of the right forelimb
was swollen, and both forelimbs were hot, at 25 days. At 31 days, the carpal joints of the
forelimbs and the tarsal joints of the hind limbs displayed swelling. The subcutaneous tissue
of the right metacarpal and metatarsal bones was swollen at 46 days of age. Amoxicillin
(Anxin; Meiji Seika Pharma Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan; 10 g, PO, q 24 hr for 7 days) and
ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (Ciproxan; Bayer Yakuhin Ltd., Osaka, Japan; 300 mg, PO, q 24 hr
for 33 days) were administered from 284 days of age, because septic arthritis was indicated on
radiographic examination. However, the joint disorder did not improve; further, the
extremities were abnormally crooked, and each limb was a different length. The calf displayed
astasia at 323 days of age and was euthanized.</p>
    <p>Calf no. 2 did not display any arthritis signs.</p>
    <p>Calf no. 3 exhibited swelling of the fetlock of the right hind limb at 4 days of age. The
calf was given amoxicillin (3.5 g, PO, q 24 hr for 4 days), and the symptom resolved. The calf
frequently lifted the right hind limb when standing from 16 days of age, and the inner hoof of
the right hind limb subsequently grew excessively, which necessitated trimming on 3 occasions
in the first year. The fetlock of the right hind limb was swollen again at 57 days, and the
right carpal joint displayed swelling at 133 days. Although oral amoxicillin was administered
intermittently when joint swelling deteriorated, the calf developed diarrhea readily and the
drug could not be administered for more than 10 days. After 6 months, the joint disorder had
resolved. However, the hoof remained long, possibly because conformation changes resulted in
ongoing excessive growth.</p>
    <p>Calf no. 4 displayed swelling of the left carpal joint at 6 days of age. Anti-inflammatory
ointment (Kanmerupasuta; Nippon Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd., Fukushima, Japan) including
dl-menthol, dl-camphor and methyl salicylate was applied for 30 days. The joint disorder was
recovered after 3 months.</p>
    <p>Calf no. 5 displayed swelling of the left and right carpal joints at 6 days of age. Although
anti-inflammatory ointment was applied, the calf died at 10 days of age because of
pneumonia.</p>
    <p>Calf no. 6 showed mild swelling of the fetlocks of both forelimbs at 6 days of age. However,
the swelling resolved without any treatment.</p>
    <p>Calf no. 7 displayed swelling of the fetlocks of both hind limbs, subcutaneous tissue of the
left metatarsal bone and left tarsal joint at 15 days of age. Radiological examination
revealed that the soft tissue around the fetlock, metatarsal bone and tarsal joint was
slightly swollen. In addition, hematological tests at 21 days showed that the white blood cell
count was 24,517/m<italic>l</italic>, indicating that the swelling might be septic
polyarthritis or phlegmon. The calf was administered sodium cefamezin (Rasenazolin; Nichi-Iko
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Toyama, Japan; 500 mg, IM, q 24 hr for 6 days). At 29 days of age,
the swelling was not detectable, and the white blood cell count had decreased to
13,280/m<italic>l</italic>.</p>

The outline of each calf until hand-rearing follows.</p>
    <p>Calf no. 1 remained with the dam until it was found moribund at 4 days of age. Consequently,
the calf did not receive any colostrum until hand-rearing started via a stomach tube at 8 days
of age.</p>
    <p>Calf no. 2 was kept with the dam for the first 18 hr. Although the calf suckled the dam, the
suckling duration was very short and the dam did not accept the calf suckling. Therefore, we
decided that all calves after calf no. 2 would be hand-reared soon after birth. The calf
refused to drink bovine colostrum from a feeding bottle. Therefore, colostrum was administered
via a stomach tube at 48 hr after birth. The calf was given the colostrum mixed with milk
replacer with a feeding bottle at 66 hr after birth and the milk replacer only from 72 hr.</p>
    <p>Calf no. 3 was born at night and seemed not to suckle the dam by the morning. It took a long
time to separate the dam from the calf, so the calf was administered bovine colostrum via a
stomach tube at 18 and 24 hr after birth. The calf drank the milk replacer from a feeding
bottle from 42 hr.</p>
    <p>Calf no. 4 was born during the day and nos. 5 and 6 at night. They had not suckled the dam at
6, 12 and 18 hr, respectively. The calves were separated from the dam at varying times after
birth depending on the difficulty of separation. Immediately after the separation, they were
administered powdered colostrum via a stomach tube. Thereafter, the calves refused to drink
anything from a feeding bottle, but calf nos. 4 and 5 drank milk replacer from a feeding
bottle from 96 and 84 hr after birth, respectively, and calf no. 6 drank powdered colostrum
from the bottle from 60 hr after birth.</p>
    <p>Calf no. 7 was separated from the dam soon after birth and drank powdered colostrum from a
feeding bottle. The calf was given the powdered colostrum mixed with milk replacer at 54 hr
and the milk replacer only from 72 hr after birth.</p>
    <p>Calf nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 contracted polyarthritis and/or phlegmon at an early stage of
life. All 6 cases displayed similar ages at onset and symptoms of swollen joints and phlegmon,
but the degree and duration of the symptoms varied.</p>
    <p>The cause of polyarthritis and/or phlegmon was considered insufficient colostrum intake,
which might have induced immune incompetence. In the present study, the giraffe calves were
given bovine or powdered colostrum. However, the immunoglobulin concentration differed between
these colostrum types. In the present study, the IgG concentration of the bovine colostrum was
not measured. However, a previous study reported that the IgG concentration is 40
mg/m<italic>l</italic> in high-quality fresh bovine colostrum in Japan, although this is
highly variable [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. On the other hand, the
concentration of the IgG in the powdered colostrum is 100 mg/m<italic>l</italic> according to
the product description. Generally, a giraffe calf weighs approximately 60 kg at birth [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The required volume of bovine colostrum for a giraffe
calf is 6&#x2013;10% of body weight per day until 3 days of age [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which equates to 3,600&#x2013;6,000 m<italic>l</italic>/day. Although the required
volume of the powdered colostrum in a giraffe calf was not stipulated, the volume of fed
colostrum was calculated using the giraffe&#x2019;s body weight according to the instructions of the
powdered colostrum. This was calculated as 2,000 m<italic>l</italic> on day 1, 2,600
m<italic>l</italic> on day 2 and 1,300 m<italic>l</italic> combined with 1,300
m<italic>l</italic> of the milk replacer on day 3. Therefore, in the present study, all the
calves have received an insufficient amount of colostrum. Moreover, the calves, except for
calf nos. 1 and 7, refused to drink the milk from the feeding bottle at first. Calves should
receive adequate colostrum within 24 hr of birth. We attempted first to accustom the calves to
the bottle, and the consequent delay in and inadequate colostrum ingestion might have affected
the immunocompetence of the calves. Sufficient colostrum should have been administered to the
calves via the stomach tube as soon as possible after birth.</p>
    <p>Insufficient colostrum ingestion might have adversely affected immunocompetence and
predisposed to septic arthritis. The bovine calf is known to exhibit neonatal lameness and
septicemia due to insufficient colostrum intake [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].
Moreover, previous reports noted that the giraffe calf did not receive the dam&#x2019;s colostrum,
which might have caused the disease [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the present study, in calf no. 7, the hematological
and radiographic findings, and the response to antibiotic treatment, indicated that the cause
of polyarthritis and/or phlegmon might have been infection. The symptoms and age of onset of
all the calves were similar to those of calf no. 7. Therefore, they might have suffered the
same disorder associated with immunocompetence and septic arthritis.</p>
    <p>Calf nos. 1, 3, 5 and 7 were born in the cold season and displayed more severe symptoms or
died within the first year compared with calf nos. 2, 4 and 6, which were born in the warm
season. The giraffe calves born in the cold season might have suffered from cold stress, which
exacerbated the symptoms of polyarthritis and/or phlegmon.</p>
    <p>In the present study, it was unclear whether the dam was displaying agalactia or producing a
small amount of colostrum. However, even if the dam produced only a small quantity of milk,
the calf could acquire immune activity, albeit weak. Therefore, calf nos. 1 and 2 might have
been able to acquire weak immune activity. The reason why the symptoms differed between calf
nos. 1 and 2 is considered the difference in temperature of the birth month. Weak immune
activity in addition to cold stress might have induced more severe symptoms in calf no. 1,
born in the cold season, compared with calf no. 2, born in the hot season. Therefore, in the
present study, the calf born in the cold season should have been administered colostrum by
hand in addition to the dam&#x2019;s natural nursing.</p>
    <p>Septic arthritis and phlegmon are known to be caused by trauma or systemic infection [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. No trauma was recorded in any of the 7 calves.
Therefore, systemic infection might have been the key factor in the septic polyarthritis
and/or phlegmon in the present study. Common sources of infection are enteritis, pneumonia and
funisitis in the bovine calf [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; enteritis and pneumonia were not recorded in the giraffe calves before
the onset of arthritis; therefore, funisitis was a possible infectious source. The calves with
the lack of immunocompetence might have been prone to umbilical cord infection, from which the
infection spread systemically. This systemic infection might have induced the septic
polyarthritis and/or phlegmon.</p>
    <p>As far as we know, this is the first report to describe multiple cases of septic
polyarthritis and/or phlegmon in giraffe calves at an early age in which insufficient
colostrum intake might have been a factor, and cold stress might have contributed to the
severity of the symptoms.</p>
