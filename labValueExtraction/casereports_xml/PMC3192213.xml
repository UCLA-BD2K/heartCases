  <body>
    <p>In fall 2010, a 63-year-old man was admitted to Wonkwang University Hospital with a 1-week history of fever and chills, and a rash over his entire body. He was fond of mountain climbing and occasionally rested on the ground while climbing mountains. At the time of admission, he appeared acutely ill, with a body temperature of 38.6&#x2103;. On physical examination, the cervical lymph nodes were tender. The patient had two different types of skin rash: erythematous maculopapules over the entire body except the face and painless erythematous, crusted papules on the face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). He was suspected of having scrub typhus, and empirical antibiotic treatment with doxycycline was initiated. After 2 days of treatment, his symptoms began to improve. On the 5th day, the rash on the face became the typical eschars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The antibody titer against Orientia tsutsugamushi, detected using an indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay, was 1:2560. After 2 weeks of treatment, the eschars fell off, but postinflammatory hyperpigmentation remained. After 45 days, the patient's skin lesions had disappeared.</p>
    <p>A previous study reported that eschars occurred in 46-92% of scrub typhus patients in Korea. Moreover, almost all of the patients had the typical single eschar, which was usually found on the chest above the umbilicus. We encountered a patient with scrub typhus who had an unusually large number of eschars on the face.</p>
