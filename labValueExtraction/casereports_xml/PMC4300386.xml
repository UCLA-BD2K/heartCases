        <p>An 8-year-old spayed female
Netherland Dwarf rabbit presented with a two-month history of dyspnea and snoring. A
computed tomography (CT) scan of the head revealed mass lesions in the right nasal cavity.
Surgical exenteration of the lesions was performed, and the histopathological diagnosis
was an intranasal adenocarcinoma. On the basis of this diagnosis, radiotherapy was planned
and consisted of eight fractions of 6 Gy administered once a week. After the completion of
radiation therapy, the soft tissue density in the right nasal cavity, as detected by CT,
significantly decreased. The prognosis has remained good for over 3 years after treatment.
This paper is the first to describe the clinical and pathological features of an
intranasal tumor in a rabbit.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Numerous infectious agents cause upper respiratory tract diseases in rabbits, and these
include mainly bacterial organisms, such as <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic>,
<italic>Bordetella bronchiseptica</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species;
however, some cases may involve viral, fungal or parasitic pathogens as well. Noninfectious
causes of upper respiratory tract disorders include traumatic injury and dental disease. The
only neoplastic disease of the nasal cavity reported in rabbits is an anecdotal report of a
carcinoma of the nasal turbinates [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
    <p>In dogs, intranasal tumors reportedly accounted for about 1% of all tumors [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and epithelial tumors, including adenocarcinomas and
squamous cell carcinomas, accounted for about 60% of intranasal tumors [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In general, the biological behavior of malignant intranasal tumors is
characterized by progressive local invasion, with the incidence of lymphatic metastasis being
as low as 10% at the initial diagnosis [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The first
choice of therapy for intranasal tumors in dogs and cats is either radiation therapy alone or
a combination of surgery and radiation therapy [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Additionally, chemotherapy has been used as the
primary treatment [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and as an adjuvant therapy [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
    <p>However, there have been no reports of nasal tumors in rabbits, and the therapeutic efficacy,
biological behavior and prognosis are unknown.</p>
    <p>Here, the authors evaluated a rabbit presenting with dyspnea and snoring, and an intranasal
mass detected by computed tomography (CT) was histologically diagnosed as an adenocarcinoma.
This report describes the treatment of this case, which has been maintained successfully for a
long period by a combination of exenteration of the intranasal mass and localized
radiotherapy.</p>
    <p>An 8-year-old spayed female Netherland Dwarf rabbit, weighing 1.36 kg, presented with dyspnea
and snoring that began 2 months earlier. Another private veterinary clinic had administered
antibiotics via a subcutaneous injection and nebulization. The rabbit&#x2019;s snoring improved, but
not the dyspnea. Three weeks later, discharge from the right nasal cavity was observed during
consultation, and a sample collected for bacterial culture yielded a negative result. Because
of the worsening dyspnea, a CT scan was performed under anesthesia for evaluation of the nasal
cavity. Images from the CT scan revealed two mass lesions of soft tissue density within the
right nasal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head of the rabbit. The soft tissue density of two
mass lesions (arrows) within the right nasal cavity is shown in the coronal aspect.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1659-g001"/></fig>). Thereafter, the rabbit was referred to our clinic for further treatment. On physical
examination, the rabbit was dyspneic and produced a snoring sound, although there was no
abnormality in the rabbit&#x2019;s external appearance, including the maxilla, nasal bridge and
orbits. A complete blood cell count and serum biochemical profile showed no abnormal findings.
Thoracic and abdominal radiographs revealed no abnormal findings, including no evidence of
pulmonary metastasis. Based on the CT images, exenteration of the intranasal mass lesions was
performed.</p>
    <p>Following premedication with an intramuscular injection of a combination of medetomidine (100
<italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/kg) and ketamine (5 mg/kg), isoflurane was administered to the rabbit
via a face mask. Subsequently, tracheal intubation was performed by a tracheostomy, with the
rabbit retained in the abdominal position. Exenteration of the intranasal mass lesions and
trephination of nasal bone were performed through a dorsal rhinotomy. In brief, the nasal
cavity was entered through a dorsal midline approach, in which the nasal bone was carbonized
using a carbon dioxide laser to expose the nasal turbinates and nasal cavity. The stoma was
extended using a rongeur, and the mass attached to the nasal septum and turbinates lining the
nasal cavity was extirpated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>The exenteration of the intranasal mass lesion. The nasal cavity was exposed by means
of a dorsal midline approach using a carbon dioxide laser, and the mass attached to the
nasal septum (arrowhead) and turbinates lining the nasal cavity was extirpated. No
obvious bone invasion or destruction was observed. The other rostral mass detected by
computed tomography (CT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>) was
determined to be nasal discharge.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1659-g002"/></fig>). No obvious bone invasion or destruction was observed. The other rostral mass detected
by CT was determined to be nasal discharge. Hemostasis was achieved with gauze pressure
packing and cauterization. After excision of all the neoplastic tissue in the right nasal
cavity, the subcutaneous tissue and skin were not closed, and a trephination orifice was made.
The tracheostomy was closed routinely.</p>
    <p>Two days after the surgery, the rabbit was doing well, but on the third day postoperatively,
her respiratory condition became unstable, because of obstruction of the trephination orifice
by crustae. Treatment to remove the crustae and maintain patency of the trephination orifice
was repeated for 2 weeks, and the respiratory condition gradually improved, except for mild
nasal snoring. The rabbit was prescribed enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg once a day orally),
metoclopramide hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg twice a day orally) and cyproheptadine hydrochloride
hydrate (0.4 mg/kg twice a day orally) for 4 weeks. The trephination orifice closed naturally,
but the respiratory condition remained normal.</p>
    <p>Histopathological evaluation of the nasal tissues revealed a glandular proliferation of
atypical columnar epithelial cells with severe lymphocytic infiltration and interstitial
hemorrhage. Tumor cells had clear to slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm and a pale oval nucleus
with mild anisokaryosis. Nucleoli were prominent in occasional tumor cells, and there were 1
to 2 mitotic figures per 400&#xD7; field. Based on the histopathological findings, the diagnosis
was an intranasal adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Histopathological findings of the intranasal mass. Glandular proliferation of atypical

observed. Hematoxylin and Eosin stain. Bar=100 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1659-g003"/></fig>).</p>
    <p>Radiation therapy was planned using an orthovoltage unit (MS-320R-2; Hitachi Medical
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Radiotherapy was initiated 4 weeks after surgery and consisted of
once weekly administration of eight fractions of 6 Gy each over 8 consecutive weeks. The
radiation was single field irradiation, and the radiation field size was 4 &#xD7; 4 cm (source to
skin distance [SSD], 40 cm). The eyes of the rabbit were shielded with lead plates during the
irradiation procedure. A CT scan (Asteion&#x2122; Super4; Toshiba Medical Systems Corporation) of the
nasal cavity before irradiation revealed a small lesion of soft tissue density within the
right nasal cavity extending to the rhinopharynx and an intact nasal septum in the transverse
aspect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_004" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head in the rabbit diagnosed with an intranasal
adenocarcinoma. A soft tissue density in the transverse aspect within the right nasal
cavity prior to radiation therapy (A) was significantly reduced after the completion of
the radiation therapy (B).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1659-g004"/></fig>). A contrast CT study was not performed, because of the small size of the mass; hence,
the CT images were strongly affected by a partial volume effect. Moreover, since the mass
adhered to the mucosal surface of nasal cavity, it was likely affected by artifact from the
nasal bone and nasal septum. After the completion of radiation therapy, the CT images taken at
the last radiation therapy visit revealed that the soft tissue density was markedly reduced
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Mild binocular cataracts and whitening
and coarsening of the fur on the nasal crest were observed during radiation therapy.
Metoclopramide hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg twice a day orally) and cyproheptadine hydrochloride
hydrate (0.4 mg/kg twice a day orally) were prescribed as appetite enhancers, with the
instructions to use them if necessary. The altered color and texture of the fur on the nasal
crest improved gradually within a few months, and the mild binocular cataracts did not
progress.</p>
    <p>There were no obvious abnormalities on follow-up CT examinations performed at 1, 6 and 12
months after radiation therapy. This patient has remained in good condition, without tumor
recurrence or delayed side effects of radiation (late-onset radiation damage) for more than 3
years after the initial presentation.</p>
    <p>Intranasal tumors are extremely rare in rabbits. Bacterial infections cause most upper
respiratory diseases and often have a chronic course. The principal symptom in this rabbit was
dyspnea, whereas clinical signs associated with intranasal tumors in dogs include sneezing,
epistaxis and/or swelling of nasal crest, with dyspnea rarely reported [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Since rabbits are obligate nasal
breathers, because of the position of the elongated epiglottis over the caudal margin of the
soft palate [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], upper respiratory tract diseases are
more severe and cause dyspnea more easily in rabbits than in other animal species. Therefore,
in contrast to dogs, initial clinical signs of intranasal tumors may include dyspnea in
rabbits. Thus, intranasal tumors should be on the list of differential diagnoses for rabbits
presenting with dyspnea, and advanced diagnostic imaging, such as CT or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), is recommended.</p>
    <p>In dogs, radiotherapy is the treatment of choice for intranasal tumors [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In one report on dogs, exenteration of nasal tumors with radiation
therapy significantly prolonged survival time compared with radiation therapy alone [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since CT contrast studies were not performed before and
after radiation therapy, it was unknown whether the small lesion of soft tissue density within
the right nasal cavity was a recurrence of the carcinoma or nasal discharge, but a combination
of surgery and radiation therapy was similarly effective and resulted in a good prognosis for
more than 3 years in this case.</p>
    <p>Mild binocular cataracts and altered color and texture of the fur on the nasal crest were
suspected side effects of acute radiation in this case. In dogs, acute phase side effects of
radiation are often noted. Specifically, rhinitis, dermatitis and mucositis can be severe and
can persist up to 4&#x2013;8 weeks after treatment [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].
Moreover, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, corneal ulceration and cataracts are common secondary
ocular changes occurring during radiation therapy [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].
In general, use of multi-fractionated irradiation can prevent these radiation side effects
[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], but the stress resulting from frequent visits
and the risk of repeated anesthesia should be considered in rabbits. Rabbits in particular are
prone to stress-induced anorexia, which may be deadly. As to the radiation protocol, although
we have used similar protocol for a few tumor cases in rabbits without remarkable side
effects, considering TDF (Time, dose and Fractionation factor) which is indicated not exceed
100 in dogs and cats [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], TDF 112 in the present case
might be excessive radiation dose. Based on these results, additional studies are necessary to
evaluate the therapeutic efficacies including radiation protocol and the prognosis of
intranasal tumors in rabbits.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, to the authors&#x2019; knowledge, this is the first report of an intranasal
adenocarcinoma in a rabbit. The authors suggest that an intranasal tumor should be considered
as a differential diagnosis for rabbits presenting with dyspnea.</p>
