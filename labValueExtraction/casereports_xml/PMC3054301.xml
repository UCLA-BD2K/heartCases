        <p>Childhood kidney tumors seldom metastasize into the cranial cavity unless it is a special histological variant. We report a 4-year-old boy with multiple intracranial metastases in the left parietotemporal and right cerebellar area from primary clear cell sarcoma of the kidney without evidence of bony metastases. Metastatic tumor revealed nests of uniformly polygonal cells with clear cytoplasm demarcated by delicate fibrovascular arcades. Tumor cells were positive for vimentin and negative for cytokeratin, S-100 protein, desmin, and myoglobin. Cellular proliferation rate measured by PCNA, and Ki-67 was not significantly different between primary tumor mass and metastatic brain lesion. Expression of p53 oncoprotein was not evident in both lesions. These findings suggested that the relapse and metastasis of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney was probably due to regrowth of micro-metastases which were present at an early stage of disease.</p>
