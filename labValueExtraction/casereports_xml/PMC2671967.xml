      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Percutaneous nephrostolithotomy (PCNL) was introduced by Fernstr&#xF6;m and
        Johansson in 1976,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-13-le-0027">1</xref> and it has remained an
        important approach for removing kidney stones since its inception. A nephrostomy tube is
        routinely positioned in the renal pelvis in order to tamponade bleeding and drain the
        collecting system. Although PCNL is an established procedure, major complication rates of up
        to 7% have been reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-13-le-0027">2</xref> We report two
        cases of an uncommon PCNL complication and details of how we managed these cases with
        successful outcomes.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="cases">
      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>Case 1 - A 52-year-old male who had previously undergone a right open nephrectomy of a
        non-functioning kidney 10 years prior underwent a left PCNL. Serum creatinine (SCr) before
        surgery was 1.0 mg/dl (normal range 0.6&#x2013;1.4 mg/dl). Access to the excretory
        system was achieved using fascial dilators, and a safety guide wire was used during the
        procedure. Intense bleeding led to a sudden interruption of the procedure; a nephrostomy
        tube was inserted and closed in order to control bleeding within the excretory system. An
        antegrade nephrostogram was not performed due to intense bleeding. An arteriography was
        performed and showed no abnormalities. After transfusion of two units of blood, the patient
        remained hemodinamically stable and urine was eliminated only by means of the urethral
        catheter. The nephrostomy tube remained closed.</p>
      <p>A magnetic resonance scan performed 72 hours later showed the nephrostomy tube in the left
        renal vein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-13-le-0027">Figure 1</xref>). The patient was
        transferred to the operating room, and the nephrostomy tube was removed under general
        anesthesia with the surgical team on standby ready to intervene. No bleeding occurred after
        removal of the catheter. The patient was discharged with a SCr level of 1.4 mg/dl.</p>
      <p>Case 2 - A 35-year-old female underwent a second PCNL for a staghorn stone in the left
        kidney. She had previously lost her right kidney due to kidney stones. The SCr level before
        surgery was 3.0 mg/dl. A PCNL was performed; access to the excretory system was gained using
        coaxial dilators, and a safety guide wire was used during the procedure. An ultrasonic
        energy source was used to fragment the stone. Severe venous bleeding was noted during the
        fragmentation process. The procedure was interrupted; a nephrostomy tube was inserted and
        maintained closed. The nephrostomy was reopened on the second postoperative day, and intense
        bleeding was observed through the catheter, which was immediately closed. An antegrade
        nephrostogram was performed and showed the presence of iodinated contrast inside the venous
        system. A computed tomography scan showed that the nephrostomy catheter was lodged inside
        the inferior vena cava (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-13-le-0027">Figure 2</xref>). The
        patient was taken to the operating room, and the nephrostomy tube was repositioned in the
        collecting system under fluoroscopy control with the surgical team on standby ready to
        intervene. The nephrostomy tube was removed 48 hours later. The patient was discharged three
        days later with a SCr level of 3.5 mg/dl.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Hemorrhage is the most significant complication of PCNL, and transfusion can be necessary
        in up to 10% of procedures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-13-le-0027">2</xref> Other
        complications include sepsis, adjacent organ perforation (such as liver, spleen, and bowel),
        failed renal access, perforation of the excretory system, pneumothorax, and pleural
          effusion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-13-le-0027">2</xref> Placing a nephrostomy tube in
        the collecting system following PCNL is a routine practice, and, in addition to its other
        advantages, it is an effective method for stopping venous bleeding.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-13-le-0027">3</xref> Occasionally, the catheter can pierce the renal parenchyma
        and migrate into the renal vein and even to the vena cava.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-13-le-0027">3</xref></p>
      <p>In the first case, the nephrostomy tube was removed, and it was relocated under
        fluoroscopic guidance in the second. In both cases, the patients were placed under general
        anesthesia, and while the surgical teams were ready to perform emergency open surgery in the
        event of uncontrolled bleeding, this was not necessary.</p>
      <p>This study is the second report in the literature regarding misplacement of a nephrostomy
        tube into the vascular system and is the first report of such a complication following
          PCNL.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-13-le-0027">4</xref> A lesion in a large renal vein
        branch caused by the instruments used during percutaneous surgery was the most likely cause
        of the observed bleeding. Furthermore, the proximity of the Amplatz sheath to the injured
        vein could have inadvertently directed the nephrostomy tube inside the venous system.</p>
      <p>Although a Doppler ultrasound was not performed after the nephrostomy tubes were removed,
        we conclude that no renal or vena cava thrombosis occurred, as these kidneys were single
        organs and renal function was maintained after the procedures in both patients. Thrombotic
        phenomena were probably not observed due to the high blood flow and low venous pressure
        inside these veins.</p>
      <p>Antegrade pyelographies were not performed in either procedure due to the bleeding, and
        this decision was likely a mistake. Antegrade pyelography at the end of a percutaneous
        procedure in order to check the exact positioning of the nephrostomy tube should be
        mandatory, even in cases of severe bleeding, and must be done routinely. In cases where
        misplacement of the tube is detected, depending on the postoperative time elapsed,
        relocation of the nephrostomy tube under fluoroscopy is strongly recommended, and the
        surgical team must stand ready to operate in case an open emergency procedure is
      required.</p>
