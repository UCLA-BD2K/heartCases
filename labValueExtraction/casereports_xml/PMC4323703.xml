      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Pigmented purpuric dermatoses (PPD) are chronic and relapsing disorders characterized by
a symmetrical rash of petechial and pigmentary macules, mainly confined to the lower
limbs. They have traditionally been divided into five clinical entities: progressive
purpuric dermatosis (Schamberg's disease), purpura annularis telanjiectoides (Majocchi's
disease), pigmented purpuric lichenoid dermatosis (Gougerot-Blum), lichen aureus and
eczematid-like purpura of Doucas and Kapetanakis.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The etiologies of these conditions are unknown but histopathology
indicates that a common immunopathogenetic mechanism is involved in all the
subtypes.<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Purpura annularis telangiectodes of Majocchi (PATM) is a less common variant of PPD
characterized by punctate telangiectatic macules, progressing to annular, hyperpigmented
patches with central clearing and infrequent atrophy, mostly seen in young females. The
disease entity remains an enigma and a therapeutic challenge. We report a PATM case that
showed excellent response to phototherapy.<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 12 year-old female presented with reddish brown lesions over both legs, which she had
had for 3 years. The lesions started as asymptomatic round to oval reddish brown
macules, present symmetrically over the ankles, progressing gradually in number, size
and extent, ultimately affecting the upper limbs, too. These macules were of varying
shapes, while size ranged from 0.3 X 0.3 cm to 12 X 5 cm. Few macules showed central
atrophy over the surface. On palpation, these macules were non-tender and
non-blanchable, with no rise in surface temperature. Palms, soles and mucosae showed no
abnormalities. Family history was negative and there was no past history of any
preceding infection or drug intake. Her routine examinations, including clotting
profile, were normal. Antinuclear antibodies were not detected and viral hepatitis
markers were negative (Figures 1 and 2).</p>

periappendageal and perivascular areas. Stains for fungus and mycobacteria revealed no
organism (Figure 3).</p>

      <p>On the basis of clinical and histopathological findings, a diagnosis of PATM was

      <p>The patient began phototherapy (thrice weekly) with psoralen plus ultraviolet A (Derma
India, Spiegel series, UVA 18, NB-UVB 18) at a dose of 1.8 J/cm2. At each session, the
dose was increased by 10% of the previous dose. The lesion started showing improvement
at 4.0 J/cm<sup>2</sup> (10<sup>th</sup> session) and this dose was maintained till the
18<sup>th</sup> session, after which the patient complained of generalized itching,
nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, suggesting intolerance to PUVA (cumulative dose of
62 J/cm<sup>2</sup>). PUVA therapy was stopped and the patient was investigated. All
routine investigations including USG abdomen were normal and the patient was managed
symptomatically. After 2 weeks, the patient recovered completely and Narrow Band UVB
(NB-UVB) was started in place of PUVA. NB-UVB was also given in thrice weekly sessions,
with a starting dose of 280 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) and increments of 10% per session. This
schedule was continued for 12 sessions, after which NB-UVB was given twice weekly
without any increments for a further 12 sessions. Following a total of 24 sessions
(cumulative dose of 16 J/cm<sup>2</sup>), most of the lesions resolved completely
without the occurrence of any new lesions. The patient is now on regular follow-up, with
complete resolution of the older lesions and no recurrence after 1 year (Figures 4 and
5).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Pigmented purpuric dermatoses (PPDs) are usually chronic and persistent dermatoses.
Majocchi's disease -a rare variant of PPD - is characterized by symmetrical, annular
patches, including punctuate red-brown macules, with a predilection for the lower
extremities. The disease affects predominantly children and young adults with female
predilection. The aetiology of PPD is still unclear. While gravity and venous
insufficiency are important localizing factors in many cases, various medications,
contact allergy to clothing dyes and focal infection, may play a role in some
patients.<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>Burrows et al. indicated the active role of T cells in
capillaritis. Furthermore, some authors suggest that cell-mediated immunity is a factor.
Immunohistologically, Schamberg's disease reveals a perivascular infiltrate of CD3+,
CD4+ and CD1a+ dendritic cells.<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Treatment of PPDs is usually difficult. Phototherapy has been reported to be effective
in a small number of patients in the literature. Gudi and White were the first to report
the effectiveness of NBUVB in treating a patient with Schamberg's disease.<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>A total of 24 treatments were given with a
cumulative dose of NB-UVB 11 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. Subsequently, Lasocki and Kelly treated
another Schamberg's disease patient with NB-UVB in combination with oral prednisolone in
tapering doses.<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>Kocaturk et al.
reported a case of pigmented purpuric lichenoid dermatitis that improved markedly with
20 NB-UVB treatments, followed by another 10 maintenance sessions with a total
cumulative dose of 27 J/cm&#xB2;.<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Fathy and Abdelgaber reported six cases of PPD, including one case of Majocchi's
disease, all of whom responded successfully to 24-28 NB-UVB treatment sessions which
were followed by further nine treatments as maintenance therapy to avoid recurrence.
<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>To the best of our knowledge,
this is the only prior report indicating treatment of Majocchi's purpura with light
therapy. Similarly, our Majocchi's purpura patient was treated successfully with
phototherapy.</p>
      <p>The proposed action mechanism of PUVA therapy in PPD is immune modulation with
alteration in the activity of T lymphocytes and concomitant suppression of interleukin-2
production.<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>The effectiveness of NB-UVB in PPD is probably due to its
immune suppressive effect on the skin. Ozawa et al. have demonstrated that 312nm
ultraviolet B light induces apoptosis in both epidermal and dermal T cells of psoriatic
lesions.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>It is possible that
NB-UVB acts similarly in PPD. We contend that phototherapy suppresses disease activity
by immune suppression in the skin, leading to complete clearance of the lesions.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, PPDs are uncommon but difficult-to-treat dermatoses. Phototherapy is an
effective and safe option in treating PPDs and can be considered a first-line therapy.
Further studies should be carried out to confirm the role of phototherapy in Majocchi's
disease.</p>
