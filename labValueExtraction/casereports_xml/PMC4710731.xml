        <p>This study demonstrated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography for
large-sized splenic hemangiosarcoma. Radiography and ultrasonography revealed the presence
of a large-sized soft-tissue mass in the cranial abdomen. Computed tomography showed
hypoattenuating mass. The mass was located in contact with liver, spleen and stomach, and
the origin of the mass remained ambiguous. The mass was T2-hyperintense and T1-hypointense
with mild contrast enhancement. MRI allowed a differentiation between large-sized tumor
and neighboring normal structure, and the mass was consequently identified as arising from
spleen. These results suggested that MRI might be a useful tool to visualize large-sized
splenic tumors and improve the accuracy of diagnosis.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Hemangiosarcoma is the most prevalent malignant splenic tumor in dogs [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Patients with hemangiosarcoma tend to be diagnosed after the tumor grows
fairly large, because the clinical signs are vague and nonspecific in the early stages. In
patients with advanced large-sized hemangiosarcoma, increased opacity of the spleen, lack of
serosal detail and displacement of other organs commonly appear on abdominal radiography
[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Ultrasonographic findings are poorly defined,
mixed echogenic (ranging from anechoic to hyperechoic), target-like or complex appearance of
spleen [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].
These general imaging techniques have been used traditionally to evaluate abdominal masses
including splenic tumors. However, when a mass grows too large, pressing upon the neighboring
structures, its origin may be difficult to determine.</p>
    <p>The introduction of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has offered
three-dimensional visualization of anatomical structures, contributing to advancements in
clinical practice. The accuracy of imaging diagnosis has been greatly improved with the
development of CT and MRI [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. While CT is now widely
used and studied in veterinary diagnostic imaging practice, MRI is primarily applied to the
central nervous system. A previous study demonstrated that MRI is superior to
contrast-enhanced CT for the detection and characterization of splenic lesions in human
patients [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These results suggest that MRI has the
potential to increase the diagnostic accuracy of splenic tumors in dogs. However, only a few
studies have reported the use of MRI in the assessment of splenic lesions in veterinary
medicine [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].
The objectives of this study were to describe MRI and CT characteristics of a large-sized
splenic tumor in a dog diagnosed with hemangiosarcoma.</p>
    <p>An 11-year-old, spayed, female poodle dog, weighing 5.3 kg, with a history of intermittent
vomiting and anorexia for several months was referred. On physical examination, subcutaneous
congestion with a palpable mass was noted in the abdomen, and the oral mucosa was pale.
Complete blood count revealed anemia (hemoglobin level, 12.1 g/d<italic>l</italic>;
hematocrit, 37.4%), thrombocytopenia (36,000/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>, reference range
200,000&#x2013;460,000/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>) and leukocytosis (14,000/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>, reference range
6,000&#x2013;12,000/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>). Serum biochemistry analysis revealed slightly elevated
total bilirubin, alanine transaminase and total protein levels. Plasma D-dimer level was
elevated (&gt;2.0 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic>), implying fibrinolysis or
hemostasis. The other parameters were within normal range.</p>
    <p>Radiography revealed a large-sized mass with soft-tissue opacity in the cranial abdomen,
caudodorsal to the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Right lateral and ventrodorsal radiographs of the abdomen. There is a large-sized mass
with soft-tissue opacity, caudodorsal to the liver. The stomach is displaced to the
right, cranially and ventrally.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-1685-g001"/></fig>). There was loss of serosal detail in this region; the liver was enlarged, with
radiopaque material in gallbladder. The fundus of the stomach was displaced cranially and
ventrally, and the body of the stomach was moved to the right. There were no significant
findings on thoracic radiographs. On ultrasonographic examination, the large-sized abdominal
mass with heterogeneous echo pattern was identified between liver and spleen. Although the
mass showed relatively well-demarcated margin, its origin could not be determined. The
parenchyma of the liver had normal echotexture. In addition, a hypoechoic nodule (15.1 &#xD7; 17.5
mm) was observed in the head of spleen.</p>
    <p>For the CT and MRI scan, anesthesia was induced using propofol (2 mg/kg intravenously) and
maintained on 2% isoflurane. CT examinations were performed using multi-detector row CT
scanner (SOMATOM Emotion, Siemens, Erlargen, Germany), with the patient in dorsal recumbency.
The scanning parameters were a slice thickness of 3 mm, 135 mA, 130 kV, 145 mm field of view
and craniocaudal scan direction. The matrix size was 512 &#xD7; 512. Considering the patient&#x2019;s slow
heart rate and wide scanning range of the entire abdomen including large-sized mass, early-
and delayed phase postcontrast CT scans were performed after administration of an intravenous
bolus of 600 mg iodine/kg iohexol (Omnipaque, Nycomed Imaging, Oslo, Norway), at a rate of 1
m<italic>l</italic>/s. The early- and delayed phase images were acquired 20 and 90 sec after
injection, respectively. The mass (65.6 &#xD7; 50.4 mm) was hypodense to the parenchyma of the
spleen and liver with focal enhanced areas on postcontrast CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2B and 2C</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Transverse CT images of abdomen (WW: 300, WL: 40). The mass appears nearly isodense to
the parenchyma of spleen and liver (A) with focal mild contrast enhancement on early
phase (B) and delayed phase (C).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-1685-g002"/></fig>). However, the origin of the mass could not be exactly determined. Because the mass was
in contact with both liver and spleen, the attenuation value difference between the two organs
went unnoticed. In addition, CT revealed pulmonary metastasis, enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes
and a splenic nodule.</p>
    <p>Subsequently, an MRI scan of the cranial abdomen, including the liver and spleen, was
performed using a 1.5-Tesla magnetic resonance unit (Magnetom Essenza, Siemens, Munich,
Germany). A body matrix coil was used, and the patients were placed in dorsal recumbency. The
matrix size was 256 &#xD7; 256, and the field of view was 145 &#xD7; 146 mm. The thickness of the slices
for all sequences was 5 mm, and transverse T1-weighted (T1W), T2-weighted (T2W) and
fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images were obtained. Postcontrast T1W images were
acquired after administration of gadodiamide (Omniscan, Nycomed Imaging). The location and
size of the mass estimated by MRI were approximately equal to those of the CT. The mass arose
from the splenic head bordering the displaced stomach. This splenic mass had heterogeneously
high signal intensity on T2W images and intermediate signal intensity, lower than that of
parenchyma of the spleen on T1W images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3A and
3B</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Transverse MRI of abdomen. The splenic mass is heterogeneous and hyperintense with
distinct difference contrast on T2W (A). The splenic mass has intermediate-signal
intensity on T1W images (B) with mild contrast enhancement on postcontrast T1W images
(C).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-1685-g003"/></fig>). On postcontrast T1W images, the splenic mass showed slightly and partially contrast
enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3C</xref>). The enlarged lymph nodes in
the mesentery and the nodule of splenic head were also identified. Based upon the CT and MRI
findings of a heterogeneous large-sized mass originating from the spleen and accompanying
metastases to the lungs and abdominal lymph nodes, a hemangiosarcoma of spleen was at the top
of the differential diagnosis list. After splenectomy, the excised splenic tumor was
histologically diagnosed as hemangiosarcoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig.
4</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_004" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Histopathological section of the splenic mass. Poorly demarcated mass composed of

Bar=200 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-1685-g004"/></fig>), and the patient was in remission during 3 months of follow-up.</p>
    <p>Hemangiosarcoma is a malignant vascular tumor with high metastatic potential [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For hemangiosarcoma treatment and prognosis, evaluation
of metastasis and complete excision of the lesion is important. Abdominal ultrasonography has
been commonly used as a conventional imaging modality for evaluation of abdominal organs in
veterinary medicine. However, there are difficulties in imaging the entire spleen of patients
with splenomegaly and limitations to the correct evaluation of origin [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The sensitivity of ultrasonography in differentiating a malignant- from
a nonmalignant mass is poor, because both types of masses tend to vary in echogenicity and
appearance [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Contrast harmonic ultrasonography is not
useful in distinguishing splenic hemangiosarcoma from nonmalignant mass, either [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
    <p>CT has a better ability to evaluate the large-sized splenic mass than ultrasonography. CT
differentiates tissues by their attenuation value, which is related to the density and
chemical composition of the tissue. Therefore, it is possible to distinguish a malignant- from
a nonmalignant mass [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A previous study demonstrated
that malignant canine splenic masses have lower attenuation values than nonmalignant masses on
non- and postcontrast CT images, probably correlating to presence of a large hematocyst in
association with splenic hemangiosarcoma [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In this
study, attenuation values of the splenic hemangiosarcoma were heterogeneously distributed from
20 to 60, which corresponded to the results of the previous study. However, the margin of the
mass was ambiguous, and the origin of the mass was not easily recognized for two reasons:
first, the large-sized mass was in contact with all adjacent structures, such as spleen, liver
and displaced stomach. Second, the differences in the attenuation value between these
structures were not significant on CT images.</p>
    <p>MRI is the most promising noninvasive imaging modality. It is considered to have contrast
resolution to the other imaging modalities, although CT provides better spatial resolution.
Especially in the localization and assessment of the soft tissue mass, MRI discriminates
subtle differences among soft tissues and displays better contrast than CT between mass and
soft tissues. The splenic hemangiosarcoma is hyperintense on T2W MRI and hypointense on T1W
MRI [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. If the signal intensity on both T1W and T2W
sequences is low, it probably reflects hemorrhagic necrosis or siderotic nodules. Hyperintense
region on both T1W and T2W images possibly corresponds to late subacute hemorrhage [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In our study, the splenic hemangiosarcoma was
heterogeneously hyperintense, and the liver was hypointense on T2W images. On T1W images, the
splenic mass showed intermediate signal intensity lower than that of splenic and hepatic
parenchyma. On postcontrast T1W images, the splenic mass showed lower signal than normal
splenic parenchyma and mildly peripheral enhancement with indistinct borders, supporting the
presence of a solid pathologic structure. Contrary to CT and other imaging modalities, the
margin between the spleen and liver was obviously identified with further contrast. The mass,
splenic parenchyma and liver were well distinctive, especially on T2W and postcontrast T1W
images. The nodule was T2-hyperintense and T1-isointense with no contrast enhancement.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, postcontrast MRI was superior to CT in terms of soft-tissue resolution of the
splenic tumor. T2W MRI and postcontrast T1W MRI were useful in evaluating a large-sized
splenic tumor. This study suggests that introduction of MRI might help to improve the
preoperative diagnostic accuracy in patients with large-sized splenic tumors.</p>
