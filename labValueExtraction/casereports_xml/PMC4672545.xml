          <p>Odontoameloblastoma is an extremely rare mixed odontogenic tumor with both epithelial and mesenchymal components. The term <italic>odontoameloblastoma</italic> first appeared in the 1971 World Health Organization classification (Pindborg JJ., et al.) and is defined as &#x201C;a neoplasm that includes odontogenic ectomesenchyme in addition to odontogenic epithelium that resembles an ameloblastoma in both structures and behavior.&#x201D; Because of the aggressive nature and risk of recurrence of the tumor, complete resection is essential. In this report, we describe an extremely rare case of a patient with massive odontoameloblastoma arising in the maxilla and occupying maxillary sinus.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Odontoameloblastoma (OA) is an extremely rare mixed odontogenic tumor that is defined in the current World Health Organization tumor classification system as a tumor that includes odontogenic ectomesenchyme and odontogenic epithelium and resembles an ameloblastoma in both structure and behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Generally, the clinical presentation of OA resembles an odontoma; thus, a definitive diagnosis is based on histologic analysis following excision and curettage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. OA and complex odontoma belong to a group of odontogenic tumors that consist of odontogenic epithelium and odontogenic ectomesenchyme with or without dental hard tissue formation (so-called mixed odontogenic tumors) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, differential diagnosis of OA is difficult compared with ameloblastic fibroodontoma or a developing complex odontoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>OA is usually found in young patients and has no significant gender predilection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Clinically, the two main complaints are swelling and failure of tooth eruption. Radiological examination usually reveals a multilocular radiolucency with a well-defined boundary and often shows radiopaque areas resembling mature dental tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. If an unerupted tooth is present, the tumor is usually situated coronally to the crown of this tooth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. We report an extremely rare case of a patient with massive OA arising in the maxilla and occupying the maxillary sinus.</p>

      <title>Case presentation</title>
      <p>In 2013, an 11-year-old Japanese boy was referred to our department for painless bone expansion in the right maxillary alveolus, delayed eruption of the permanent second molar teeth, and altered occlusion. He had no significant medical or family history. A panoramic X-ray showed a unilocular cystic lesion in the right maxilla containing a calcified large mass associated with an impacted tooth (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Computed tomography showed a cystic lesion of size 3.6&#xD7;3.1&#xD7;2.7 cm that included calcified structures (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). A horizontal view showed right maxillary bone expansion (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>An unilocular cystic lesion in the right maxilla containing calcified mass in the lesion associated with impacted tooth (arrow)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13256_2015_743_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Computed tomographic images. <bold>a</bold> Axial view computed tomographic image showing a cystic lesion of size 3.6&#xD7;3.1&#xD7;2.7 cm that included calcified structures. <bold>b</bold> Horizontal view computed tomographic scan showing right maxillary bone expansion (<italic>arrows</italic>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13256_2015_743_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
      <p>In 2013, the patient underwent tumor extirpation combined with impacted tooth extraction. The incisional line was started from the labial mucosa in the right maxillary central and lateral incisor area. It extended to the gingiva in the right maxillary lateral incisor and canine area by arch-like incision, and to the gingiva of the right maxillary second molar by crestal incision with distal releasing incision. The goal of this procedure was to make a mucoperiosteal flap from the lower border of the pyriform aperture, vertically to the infraorbital foramen and surrounding areas, and horizontally to the lower border of the zygomatic bone. The infraorbital neurovascular bundles were preserved. Upon opening of the sinus from a thin plate of bone in the canine fossa and surrounding areas in the anterior wall of the right maxilla (the same level as the lower border of the pyriform aperture), bone-like hard tissues that were strongly adhered to the maxilla were found. When these tissues were separated from the surrounding areas and removed using a fissure bar, a solid, bone-like, hard odontogenic tumor (similar to a complex odontoma) was found to have occupied almost the whole sinus. The mass was too large to remove from the opening.</p>
      <p>For complete removal of the mass including the tumor capsule, which was adhered to the surrounding bone, the tumor was divided into several pieces using a fissure bar (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). There was an unerupted permanent tooth in the posterior part of the maxillary sinus anterior wall directly above the tumor resection site. This tooth appeared to have been pushed up by the tumor. It deviated from the dental arch and was included in the tumor body. This made preservation difficult, and the tooth was extracted (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). A part of the root apex of the right maxillary first molar protruded through the tumor resection site, and conservative treatment was applied because of the patient&#x2019;s age. There was no tooth germ of the unerupted second molar in the tumor resection cavity. There was access between the sinus and the tumor resection cavity, but there were no signs of maxillary sinusitis, which allowed use of conservative treatment. After hemostasis was confirmed, the incision was stitched closed. After the tumor extirpation, the wound was sutured with VICRYL absorbable stitches (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA). Examination of the surgical specimen showed that the lesion consisted of various hard tissues, including a tooth-like structure (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). A histological examination indicated the presence of a mixture of dentin and enamel with a radial structure (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Fibrous tissues were observed between the hard tissues, which suggested mild mononuclear cell infiltration. Furthermore, the hard tissues were covered by fibrous tissues, and odontogenic epithelial-like cell structures were externally elongated from the inside to the outer boundary of the hard tissues. A palisade arrangement of cylindrical cells was seen in the margin of the odontogenic epithelial-like cell structures, and stellate cells had proliferated in the alveolar structures (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b and c</xref>). Cellular atypism was unremarkable, and there were few Ki-67-positive cells. These features confirmed the diagnosis of an OA. The histopathological diagnosis was OA.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Intraoperative view showing extirpation of the tumor arising in the maxilla (arrow)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13256_2015_743_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig><fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Surgical specimens</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13256_2015_743_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig><fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>OA is an aggressive odontogenic tumor characterized by simultaneous occurrence of an ameloblastoma and a compound or complex odontoma in the same tumor mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. OA affects males and females equally and occurs in the maxilla and mandible, with the molar-premolar area being the most common site. Clinical symptoms include slow, progressive swelling of the alveolar plates, bone expansion, root resorption, dull pain, altered occlusion, tooth displacement, delayed eruption, and impacted teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. OA occurs between the ages of 2 and 50 years and at a mean age of 20.2 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, as in our patient, most cases occur in children under 16 years of age.</p>
      <p>The origin of an OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] has been proposed to be malignant transformation of the enamel epithelium after odontogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] or malignant transformation of the epithelium and mesenchyme of supernumerary teeth during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, a definitive theory has yet to be established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, the disease is often accompanied by an impacted tooth, but the causative link between the tumor and the impacted tooth is unclear. Thompson <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] suggested that the tumor capsule may be derived from mesenchymal tissue, based on the property of this tissue to form dental hard tissue. The origin of our case was unclear, but between tumor and tumor capsule that similar to the dental follicle around the impacted tooth was connected, with irregular structures and dentinal hyperplasia was seen, we guessed tumor transformation was caused by interaction between the odontogenic epithelium which degenerated and mesenchymal tissue during the degenerated tooth process. This suggests that tumor formation may occur during the process of crown formation of the impacted tooth.</p>
      <p>Ameloblastoma, complex odontoma, compound odontoma, and dentigerous cysts may be differentiated by imaging, but their diagnosis also requires histopathological examination. A definitive diagnosis is difficult to make on the basis of imaging and clinical findings alone; therefore, total excision is required. Masqueda-Taylor <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] found recurrence in 3 (21.4 %) of 14 OA cases. On the basis of these data and findings that OA tends to occur at an earlier age than conventional ameloblastoma and because it has a similar potential to produce bone expansion, root resorption, and recurrence, it was suggested that OA should be treated similarly to ameloblastoma, with wide excision and close follow-up for at least 5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, the first-choice treatment for OA is complete surgical extirpation of the tumor, including wide excision. We also suggest that treatment of OA requires close cooperation of oral and maxillofacial surgeons with orthodontic and pedodontic specialists, including primary care dentists. This multidisciplinary treatment is required because most cases of OA in pediatric patients are associated with displaced, unerupted permanent teeth.</p>
      <p>Clinically, OA starts as a slow-growing, painless mass that expands the alveolus and vestibular cortex and prevents eruption of permanent teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Our patient had expansion in the right maxillary alveolus, prevention of eruption of permanent teeth, altered occlusion, tooth displacement, delayed eruption, and impacted teeth. Most reported cases have had symptoms such as swelling or pain, but in our patient the tumor was asymptomatic and was detected during a routine examination. OA also tends to produce bone expansion in almost all cases, similarly to conventional ameloblastoma, whereas an odontoma seldom produces swelling of the affected region. Therefore, OA is often confused with compound or complex odontomas, as in our patient. Our patient has had no recurrence for 27 months postoperatively. However, the recurrence rate of OA is 21.4 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and malignant transformation may occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, long-term follow-up will be continued for our patient.</p>
