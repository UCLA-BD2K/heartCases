        <p>Intraorbital foreign bodies often present a confusing clinical
picture. Wooden foreign bodies are notorious for remaining
quiescent for a long time, before presenting with a variety of
complications. The wound of entry may often be small and
self-sealing. Wooden foreign bodies also show a propensity
to break during attempted removal. Intraorbital wood is often
not detected by standard diagnostic tests like the computed
tomography scan, adding to the diagnostic dilemma. The
presence of an intraorbital mass with a discharging sinus should
evoke suspicion of a retained organic foreign body, regardless of
the time interval between the trauma and current presentation. It
is imperative to maintain a high index of suspicion in such cases
to avoid misdiagnosis. We report an unusual case of a missed
wooden intraorbital foreign body, which spontaneously extruded
after five years.</p>

    <p>The orbit and its diseases often present a diagnostic dilemma to
the ophthalmologist. Foreign bodies of the orbit may give rise to
a diverse range of clinical problems, which may be perplexing
to the most experienced ophthalmologist. Wooden foreign
bodies are notorious for remaining quiescent for a long time,
before presenting with a variety of complications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Cases have
been reported in which the usual diagnostic techniques did
not detect intraorbital wood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> We report an unusual
case of a missed wooden intraorbital foreign body, which spontaneously
extruded after five years.</p>

      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>A 19-year-old male presented to the casualty with a history of
injury to his left eye by a palm leaf, which fell from a height of
about 10 meters. A piece of the stalk had been removed from the
wound at a local hospital earlier in the day. On examination, his
vision was 20/20, the globe was intact and ocular movements
were full. A superficial wound was noted at the left infraorbital
margin. There was no evidence of residual foreign body. The
wound was dressed and the patient was asked to review in the
outpatient department.</p>
      <p>The patient returned 18 months later with a swelling at the
same site. On examination, his vision was still 20/20. There was
a non-axial proptosis of the left eye with limitation of elevation.
The globe was pushed 3 mm forwards and 2 mm upwards. A
2 &#xD7; 1 cm firm, non-tender mass was present at the infraorbital
margin. The posterior extent of the mass could not be defined.
There was a small scar on the skin over the mass. Computed
tomography (CT) scan of the orbit obtained in axial and coronal
planes depicted a medium-sized soft tissue density mass in
the inferomedial aspect of the left orbit. The mass involved the
retrobulbar, intra and extraconal spaces, abutting and slightly
displacing the optic nerve superiorly [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1A">1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1B">B</xref>].</p>
      <p>An incision biopsy of the mass at the infraorbital margin
was done. Histopathological examination showed features of
chronic inflammation with fibroblastic proliferation [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2A">2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2B">B</xref>]. As the results of the investigations did not suggest the presence
of a retained intraorbital foreign body, we considered other
possible diagnoses like tuberculosis, sarcoidosis and idiopathic
orbital inflammation. However, systemic examination did not
reveal any clinical evidence of tuberculosis or sarcoidosis.
Complete blood count, ESR, Mantoux test and Chest X-ray were
within normal limits. As the patient was not very symptomatic
at the time, we decided to keep him under observation for some
time. However, he was lost to follow-up again.</p>
      <p>He presented two years later with a discharging sinus at
the site. At this point, we strongly suspected the presence of
a residual foreign body and advised a magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) scan of the orbit. The patient, however, deferred
the scan due to financial constraints. Meanwhile, the discharge
from the sinus was sent for culture and sensitivity. It grew
<italic>Enterobacter</italic> species, sensitive to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin,
lomefloxacin and gentamicin. The patient was started on
systemic antibiotics (Tab. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily)
and daily dressing of the sinus was continued. One week
later, a foreign body, measuring 1.2 cm, was seen in the gauze
when the dressing was removed. On follow-up, there was no
further discharge from the sinus. So further active intervention
was deferred at that point and the patient was advised regular
follow-up. He defaulted again.</p>
      <p>The patient came back to the hospital 18 months later. He
said that he had been having recurrent discharge from the
sinus, which was being dressed at a local hospital. Another
piece of the wooden foreign body was seen on the gauze when
the dressing was removed that day. He brought the specimen
along to show us. It measured 9 mm [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>]. On follow-up,
the swelling resolved and the sinus healed completely. His
vision was still 20/20. We repeated a CT scan of the orbit a
year later, which showed complete resolution of the mass
[Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4A">4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4B">B</xref>].</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The clinical course of orbital foreign bodies differs depending
on their composition. Most metallic foreign bodies remain
quiescent for a long period of time without causing any
problems. So the general recommendation is to leave them
alone in the absence of specific indications for removal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
However, organic foreign bodies like wood have a much
higher incidence of potentially sight-threatening and life-
threatening complications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> They may remain dormant for
a variable period of time and manifest with delayed-onset
orbital granuloma, cellulitis, abscess or chronic draining sinus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
Hence, surgical removal of organic intraorbital foreign bodies
is recommended.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></p>
      <p>In our case, a piece of the foreign body had been removed
after the initial trauma. When seen in our casualty on the
evening of the same day, the wound looked superficial and there
was no clinical evidence of a residual foreign body. However,
multiple pieces of wood were extruded over five years. It is
important to remember that wooden foreign bodies often
break during attempted removal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> The associated wound may
be small and self-sealing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> Therefore, if there is recurrence of
clinical symptoms, especially, if there is a discharging sinus, the
possibility of a retained foreign body should be considered.</p>
      <p>Imaging and prompt exploration of the sinus may help
in localizing and removing the foreign body. A CT scan is
the standard diagnostic test, because it demonstrates most
intraorbital foreign bodies and is safe in the presence of metallic
foreign bodies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> In our case, however, the CT scan did not show
any evidence of the foreign body. Review of previous reports
suggests that wood is often not detected on CT scan.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> Computed
tomographic imaging relies on the differing radiodensities of
tissues for their differentiation. The radiodensity of wood is
variable and may be similar to that of the orbital tissues, which
may account for the potential difficulty of recognition. The
CT appearances seem related to the interval between injury
and examination.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> In the acute stage, the very low density of
wood can be confusing with low window settings, mimicking
air bubbles. In the subacute stage, wood assumes a moderate
density and may be difficult to distinguish from surrounding
orbital fat. In the chronic stage, the density of wood can become
higher than that of orbital muscle. It may be associated with a
foreign-body reaction, which appears as a homogenous mass
surrounding the dense wooden foreign body, with a density
similar to the adjacent extraocular muscles. Spiral CT scanners
have improved resolution and faster speed of acquisition of
images.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> The fast image capture allows the scanning to occur
with minimal motion artifact. In spite of these advantages,
wooden intraocular foreign bodies could only be described as
&#x2033;probable intraocular foreign bodies&#x2033; by neuroradiologists in
a pilot study using a spiral CT scanner.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></p>
      <p>The MRI scans are better at demonstrating wooden foreign
bodies. Magnetic resonance imaging depends on the density of
protons in the tissue and their different relaxation times. These
properties of wood are dissimilar enough from those of the soft
tissue to allow differentiation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> Therefore, it is recommended
that MRI scan should be performed after a negative CT scan
if there is a possibility of a wooden intraorbital foreign body.
An MRI scan may be performed as the primary imaging
modality if there is a definite history of a wooden intraorbital
foreign body.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></p>
      <p>Several aspects of this case are interesting. The long latent
period between injury and development of the orbital mass
and sinus, the apparent removal of the foreign body from the
wound after the initial trauma, the spontaneous extrusion of
pieces of the foreign body twice with an interval of 18 months
and complete resolution of the orbital mass on CT scan are
distinctive features of this case. The entire sequence of events
spanned over five years. This was partly due to the frequent
defaulting on the part of the patient.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we would like to emphasize that intraorbital
foreign bodies may often present a confusing clinical picture.
It is important for the ophthalmologist, radiologist and
pathologist to include foreign body granuloma among the
differentials of an intraorbital mass. It is imperative to seek
past and recent history of trauma and maintain a high index of
suspicion in all such cases, regardless of the interval between
the trauma and current presentation.</p>
