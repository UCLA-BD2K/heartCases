      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Granular cell tumor is a rare, typically benign neoplasm usually of Schwann cell origin.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Granular cell tumor can occur anywhere in the body. However, majority of granular cell tumors involve the head and neck region, and they have only rarely been reported to involve the trachea.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Because of its rarity and unusual location, granular cell tumor of the trachea may be clinically misdiagnosed as thyroid mass or tracheal invasion from thyroid carcinoma.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Herein, we present a case of unusual granular cell tumor of the trachea coexisting with recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma and masquerading as tracheal invasion of recurred thyroid carcinoma.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 45-year-old female presented to our clinic with blood-tinged sputum, cough, and shortness of breath of 3 weeks duration. The patient had a history of left thyroid lobectomy due to thyroid carcinoma at another hospital, and she was lost to follow-up after surgery. The laboratory test and chest radiography findings were normal. Rigid bronchoscopy revealed a smooth, polypoid, yellow lesion emanating from the anterior cervical tracheal wall and occluding &gt;90% of the airway (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a suspicious recurrent thyroid carcinoma with invasion into the tracheal lumen and left lateral neck metastasis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Fine-needle aspiration cytology was performed under ultrasound guidance, and the left neck lymph node was interpreted as being consistent with metastatic papillary carcinoma.</p>

      <p>Based on these observations, the patient was initially diagnosed with recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma with tracheal invasion and left lateral neck metastasis. Initially, we performed tracheal mass removal by rigid bronchoscopy with electrocautery and argon plasma coagulation. After airway stabilization, completion thyroidectomy and left modified radical neck dissection were performed. During surgery, thyroid lobe and trachea were easily dissected, and there was no evidence of neoplastic infiltration into tracheal rings. Therefore, we completed the operation without tracheal ring resection. Pathological examination of the thyroid and left neck lymph nodes revealed recurrent and metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma. However, pathological diagnosis of the tracheal mass was consistent with granular cell tumor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The tracheal mass was strongly positive for S-100 protein on immunohistochemical staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This case was finally diagnosed as unusual granular cell tumor of the trachea coexisting with recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma. The postoperative course was uneventful. At the 13- month follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic and bronchoscopy and CT showed no recurrence of thyroid carcinoma and granular cell tumor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This study was approved by the institutional review board of the Chonnam National University Hwansun Hospital. Informed consent was given by the patient.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Granular cell tumor occurs in a wide variety of organs, with the most common involvement site being the head and neck region.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The reported rate of respiratory tract involvement is &#x223C;11%, and the laryngobronchial tree is involved more often than the trachea.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Therefore, if a extremely rare granular cell tumor occurs in the trachea, this lesion may be clinically misdiagnosed as tracheal invasion from thyroid carcinoma.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The misdiagnosis of granular cell tumor of the trachea may be occurred in patients with thyroid nodules or previous history of operation for thyroid carcinoma, as in this patient.</p>
      <p>Granular cell tumor of the trachea is asymptomatic.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In some cases, patients may present with respiratory symptoms, such as progressive dyspnea unresponsive to bronchodilator and steroid therapy, cough, wheezing, and hemoptysis.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
      <p>A careful history, physical examination, radiologic examination, and a high index of suspicion are necessary for making the diagnosis of granular cell tumor of the trachea.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy can reveal the extent of the lesion and a biopsy can be performed.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be helpful to evaluate the intraluminal extent of the lesion, and extraluminal spread to the esophagus, mediastinum, or trachea.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The diagnosis of granular cell tumor should be confirmed by histopathologic examination with immunohistochemical staining such as S-100 protein and neuron-specific enolase.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The differential diagnosis for granular cell tumor of the trachea includes all subglottic masses, such as benign or malignant tumors of the trachea, esophagus, thyroid, and mediastinum.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The definitive treatment of granular cell tumor of the trachea is complete surgical excision including bronchoscopic excision and tracheal resection.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Tracheal resection has the best cure rate; however, it also has a significantly high mortality rate.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In this patient, we initially planned to perform tracheal resection. However, there was no evidence of invasion from both granular cell tumor of the trachea and recurrent papillary carcinoma. Therefore, in this patient, granular cell tumor was treated by bronchoscopic excision without tracheal resection.</p>
      <p>There were some unique characteristics of this case. First, this was the second reported case of unusual granular cell tumor of the trachea coexisting with papillary thyroid carcinoma.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Second, we initially misdiagnosed this patient as having tracheal invasion from recurrent thyroid carcinoma even after a CT scan and fine-needle aspiration cytology. Misdiagnosis occurred as the patient had a previous history of operation for thyroid carcinoma and a suspicious recurrent thyroid carcinoma with invasion into the tracheal lumen and left lateral neck metastasis based on the interpretation of CT scans. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of granular cell tumor of the trachea occurring simultaneously with papillary thyroid carcinoma.</p>
