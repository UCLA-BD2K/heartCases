  <body>
    <p>A 66-year-old woman, native of Venturosa (Pernambuco, Brazil) and resident of S&#xE3;o
Paulo (S&#xE3;o Paulo, Brazil), was hospitalized for intense dyspnea on June 8, 2013.</p>
    <p>At 61years of age (on February 26, 2007), the patient was initially examined at the Heart
Institute (InCor) with the complaint of dyspnea during daily life activities and paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea since 1 year. The dyspnea was observed 3 years prior, initially upon
greater efforts along with palpitations, nausea, and pain in the lower limbs. She
complained of chest pain after emotional upset.</p>
    <p>She presented a history of arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus since the age of 56
as well as mixed dyslipidemia and hyperuricemia.</p>
    <p>Physical examination showed a heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, and
jugular stasis. Crackle was heard at the lung bases. Cardiac auscultation revealed a split
first heart sound. Abdominal examination showed no abnormalities. Further, no edema was
observed in the lower limbs, and the pulses were symmetrical.</p>
    <p>An ECG performed in February 2007 revealed sinus rhythm, heart rate of 67 bpm, left bundle
branch block, and left ventricular hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure
1</xref>).</p>

natriuretic peptide (BNP) 115 pg/mL, and uric acid 7.3 mg/dL. Serological testing for
Chagas disease was negative.</p>
    <p>Medications included spironolactone 25 mg, carvedilol 6.25 mg, furosemide 40 mg, losartan
100 mg (cough was reported with use of captopril), allopurinol 100 mg, simvastatin 20 mg,
acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg, metformin 2,550 mg, glibenclamide 10 mg, and NPH insulin 30 U

    <p>An echocardiogram on April 26, 2007 showed aortic diameter of 32 mm and left atrial
diameter of 44 mm, interventricular septum thickness of 9 mm, posterior wall thickness of
10 mm, left ventricular diameter (systolic/diastolic) of 81/74 mm, ejection fraction of
18%, diffuse hypokinesia of the left ventricle, and normal valves.</p>
    <p>Myocardial scintigraphy conducted in November 2008 revealed discrete fixed hypercaptation
in medial and apical portions of the anteroseptal wall, and there was no redistribution of
thallium-201 reinjection. There was diffuse hypokinesia and anteroapical dyskinesia, and
the ejection fraction was 11% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">3</xref>).</p>

    <p>The patient sought emergency medical attention for worsening of dyspnea, which had begun 3
days prior, accompanied by a dry cough and no fever. Patient was taking carvedilol 25 mg,
furosemide 40 mg, spironolactone 25 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg, ciprofibrate 100 mg, metformin
2550 mg, acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg, and 30 IU of NPH insulin.</p>
    <p>She reported taking antibiotics to treat pneumonia and a urinary tract infection 30 days
prior to seeking emergency care.</p>
    <p>Upon physical examination on June 8, 2013, the patient was in her regular general state,
cyanotic, with tachydyspnea, respiratory rate of 40 rpm, heart rate of 110 bpm, and blood
pressure of 140/100 mmHg. There was crackling stridor up to the apex of both the lungs,
hypophonic heart sounds, abdomen without alterations, and edema of the lower limbs ++/4+;
the patient's wrists were symmetrical. The patient was diagnosed with acute edema of the
lungs and was administered furosemide 20 mg and morphine bolus 3 mg along with initiation
of continuous intravenous nitroglycerin 5 &#xB5;g/min and non-invasive ventilation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f06">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

C-reactive protein 28.42 mg/dL, TSH 1.40 &#xB5;UI/mL, CK-MB 6.42 ng/mL, and troponin I
0.236 ng/mL.</p>
    <p>The patient continued to have significant dyspnea and exhibited a reduced level of
consciousness requiring orotracheal intubation for respiratory support. During this
procedure, she experienced a pulseless cardiac arrest with cessation of electrical
activity; however, she was resuscitated. The presence of pneumothorax was noted by marked
decrease in vesicular breath sounds on the right side, which was immediately drained.</p>

      <title>Clinical aspects</title>
      <p>This is the case of a patient who began outpatient follow-up with symptoms of heart
failure and effort dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxistic nocturnal dyspnea with increasing
intensity as well as with jugular stasis and bi-basal crackles (revealed by physical
examination)<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Heart failure is the final outcome of most cardiovascular diseases, and is very
prevalent in Brazil. With 1,156,136 admissions in 2007, cardiovascular diseases is known
to be the third most common cause of hospitalization in the Brazilian Unified Health
System (SUS), with heart failure being the most frequent. Like other developed
countries, the principal etiologies of heart failure in Brazil are hypertension and
chronic ischemic heart disease, but other etiologies are also present, such as Chagas
cardiomyopathy, endomyocardial fibrosis, and degenerative as well as rheumatic valvular
disease<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The patient's echocardiogram showed enlarged left cardiac chambers and a sharply reduced
left ventricular ejection fraction from diffuse hypokinesia, allowing a diagnosis of
dilated cardiomyopathy, which is the most common of the cardiomyopathies essentially
characterized by dilatation and compromised contraction of the left ventricle or both
ventricles<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The hospitalization rate is high in patients with heart failure, mainly precipitated by
decompensation, poor adherence to treatment (dietary as well as medication), cardiac
ischemia, uncontrolled hypertension, arrhythmias, and infectious causes<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Mortality in patients with heart failure
is also high with a 5-year survival rate of 50%<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. There are some morphological parameters that may indicate a
poorer prognosis with increased risk for sudden death, arrhythmias, and embolism. These
parameters include the degree of impairment of ejection fraction (mainly in ejection
fractions below 25%), increase in left ventricular and/or right ventricular volume,
ventricular dyssynchrony, and decrease in mass/volume ratio<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Among the clinical and laboratorial parameters, the New
York Heart Association functional class IV has a poorer prognosis, as do younger
patients, women, patients with syncope, S3 gallop, right heart failure upon examination,
left bundle branch block, first or second degree atrioventricular blockage, and
hyponatremia<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Among these
factors, in this case, the patient presented a sharply reduced ejection fraction,
ventricular enlargement, was female, and had left bundle branch block.</p>
      <p>The main causes of death in patients with heart failure are complications, such as
sudden death/arrhythmias and pulmonary embolism as well as progressive deterioration of
the ventricular function with subsequent hemodynamic collapse<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>In this case, the patient had dilated cardiomyopathy with no prior history of
myocarditis, no report of alcohol or substance abuse, and no significant personal or
family background; however, she did have cardiovascular risk factors that made
idiopathic etiology less likely. For this patient, the most likely etiologies for
cardiomyopathy were hypertensive or ischemic.</p>
      <p>Myocardial scintigraphy showed areas of hypercaptation, suggesting an ischemic origin
for the cardiomyopathy, but these findings may be attributed to the presence of left
bundle branch block or artifacts resulting from mammary attenuation; additionally, the
patient had no prior history of heart attack and her echocardiogram showed no areas of
akinesia.</p>
      <p>The patient's electrocardiogram showed left ventricular overload, which supports
hypertensive etiology, as well as the echocardiogram, which exhibited increased
ventricular mass and diffuse hypokinesia.</p>
      <p>After the initial assessment, therapy was optimized with medications known to modify the
rates of hospitalization and mortality for patients with heart failure resulting from
reduced ejection fraction (carvedilol, enalapril, and spironolactone)<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and agents to relieve symptoms
(furosemide). The patient remained asymptomatic until she was hospitalized for acute
decompensated heart failure.</p>
      <p>In this case, the patient exhibited leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance and
elevated C-reactive protein indicating a possible infectious cause for decompensation.
These factors, along with the findings of tachycardia and tachypnea, and the severity
criteria such as renal dysfunction and neurological changes (reduced consciousness
level), allow a diagnosis of severe sepsis, a disease with a mortality rate of 48% in
Brazil, with worse prognosis in patients with previous comorbidities such as
cardiomyopathy<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Although it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between sepsis and decompensated
heart failure, treatment of sepsis should not be delayed and must be started within the
first hour of diagnosis, because for every hour of delay there is a 4% increase in
mortality.</p>
      <p>The rapid evolution of our patient, requiring orotracheal intubation and subsequent
pulseless cardiac arrest, led us to discuss the main causes of this type of cardiac
arrest such as hypoxia, hypovolemia, acidosis, hyper/hypokalemia, pneumothorax,
pulmonary embolism, and acute myocardial infarction<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Although pulmonary embolism is one of the leading causes of death in patients with heart
failure and the patient did present the most frequent symptoms (tachypnea and
tachycardia), she was considered to be hypotensive and without pulmonary congestion.</p>
      <p>In a patient with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension,
dyslipidemia, and diabetes, an important differential diagnosis is myocardial ischemia,
which is a leading cause of mortality in diabetic patients because of more extensive
disease and atypical symptoms<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.
Although the patient was experiencing hemodynamic stress, was hypertensive, and showed
signs of infection, which increases myocardial oxygen demand, acute coronary syndrome
was not the main diagnostic hypothesis because she did not exhibit any objective
evidence of ischemia, remembering that we did not have electrocardiographic parameters
because of left bundle branch block, or clinical parameters because she was diabetic.
The markers for myocardial necrosis were slightly elevated, but in patients with
decompensated heart failure or with altered renal function, these values can present
alterations as a result of the cardiac injury itself. We cannot rule out the possibility
that the patient suffered a heart attack, because there was no time to conduct serial
testing of markers.</p>
      <p>In the case presented, the most likely cause of death was sepsis. The patient presented
in a state of infection, likely with a pulmonary focus, and progressed to severe sepsis,
a disease with high mortality, particularly in individuals with severe comorbidities.
During its evolution, the case exhibited complications such as respiratory failure and
pneumothorax, which further exacerbated the hypoxia, cell suffering, metabolic acidosis,
and electrolytic disorders, culminating in pulseless cardiac arrest and death.</p>

        <title>Autopsy</title>
        <p>The heart weighed 824 g. There was intense hypertrophy of the left ventricle with
moderate dilation of the cavity and an area of irregular fibrous replacement of the
posterior myocardium, corresponding to a small scarred infarction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f09">Figure&#xA0;9</xref>). A histological examination of the
myocardium showed diffuse hypertrophy of the cardiomyocytes with small and rare foci
of necrosis, formation of microabscesses and myocardial sclerosis in the
subendocardial region of the left ventricle, and confirmed the area of fibrous
replacement in the posterior wall. The coronary arteries were dissected and subjected
to histological study, identifying discrete atherosclerosis with plaque in focal
areas of calcification in the proximal segments without significant obstructive
lesions. The aortic valve was trivalvular and did not exhibit any abnormalities.
Atherosclerosis of the aorta was moderate with the presence of focal calcified
plaque. Examination of the lungs showed slight chronic passive congestion and
extensive bilateral bronchopneumonia affecting all lobes of both the lungs, but was
more intense in the right lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Figure 10</xref>). The
kidneys had a fine granular surface, and on histological examination, atherosclerosis
of the arterial branches and hyaline arteriosclerosis were observed. The glomeruli
were preserved. Other findings of the autopsy were multiple intramural and subserous
uterine leiomyomas (the largest measuring 4.0 cm), an endometrial polyp (filling the
uterine cavity) measuring 5.0&#xA0;cm, and an ovarian fibroma measuring 0.7 cm. <bold>Dr.

      <p>A case of a 66-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart
failure. In her last hospitalization, she exhibited respiratory failure with a diagnosis
of acute pulmonary edema. She received drug treatment, but progressed to worsened
respiratory status requiring orotracheal intubation, and died in less than 24 h after
admission.</p>
      <p>An autopsy revealed decompensated hypertensive heart disease<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. The heart exhibited a large increase in mass due to
severe left ventricular hypertrophy, weighing 824 g. Although there was no significant
coronary atherosclerosis, a small scarred infarction was found on the posterior wall of
the left ventricle. This previous ischemic event was likely related to the exaggerated
consumption of the hypertrophic myocardium, coupled with microvascular disease, and
endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive heart disease<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The terminal cause of death was extensive confluent bilateral bronchopneumonia. Further,
evidence of septicemia was found along with the presence of small microabscesses in the
myocardium. Bronchopneumonia was not diagnosed while the patient was alive, because the
respiratory failure that caused the patient's last hospitalization was interpreted and
treated as acute pulmonary edema of cardiogenic origin. However, it should be noted that
the patient only survived a short time after seeking medical attention, preventing
further enlightening supportive examinations. Dr. Luiz Alberto Benvenuti</p>
