      <abstract>
        <p>Patients with cleft lip and palate usually present dental anomalies of number, shape,
structure and position in the cleft area and the general dentist is frequently asked
to restore or extract those teeth. Considering that several anatomic variations are
expected in teeth adjacent to cleft areas and that knowledge of these variations by
general dentists is required for optimal treatment, the objectives of this paper are:
1) to describe changes in the innervation pattern of anterior teeth and soft tissue
caused by the presence of a cleft, 2) to describe a local anesthetic procedure in
unilateral and bilateral clefts, and 3) to provide recommendations to improve
anesthetic procedures in patients with cleft lip and palate. The cases of 2 patients
are presented: one with complete unilateral cleft lip and palate, and the other with
complete bilateral cleft lip and palate. The patients underwent local anesthesia in
the cleft area in order to extract teeth with poor bone support. The modified
anesthetic procedure, respecting the altered course of nerves in the cleft maxilla
and soft tissue alterations at the cleft site, was accomplished successfully and the
tooth extraction was performed with no pain to the patients. General dentists should
be aware of the anatomic variations in nerve courses in the cleft area to offer high
quality treatment to patients with cleft lip and palate.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Cleft lip and palate (CLP) comprises the most prevalent congenital malformation in the
maxillofacial region. Epidemiological data shows that 1:611 children are born with CLP
in South America<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. The embryological
mechanism that causes CLP in the premaxillary region occurs between the 5<sup>th</sup>
and 8<sup>th</sup><sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> week of embryologic development, when fusion of the
lateral and medial nasal processes with the anterior extension of maxillary processes on
either side fails. A change in nasal process growth direction may be one explanation for
developing CLP<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. On the other hand,
development of a cleft in the secondary palate occurs between the 7<sup>th</sup> and
12<sup>th</sup><sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> weeks of intrauterine life and can result from: 1)
failure of palatal ridges to contact because of a growth deficiency or disturbance in
the ridge elevation mechanism, 2) failure of the ridges to merge after contact has been
established because the epithelium lining does not reabsorb, 3) an unexpected rupture
after the palatine ridges merge, or, 4) defective consolidation of mesenchymal palatine
ridges<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The presence of CLP leads to aesthetic, functional and psychological disturbances that
require action by a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary team<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, in which the dentist is represented in
all its areas of expertise. The rehabilitation protocol requires continuous monitoring
throughout the growing phase of patients with CLP, so that the patient is aesthetically
and functionally rehabilitated to reach adulthood<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. However, it is very important that general dentists, although
not directly tied to a team, have basic knowledge of the anatomic changes in the CLP
area and the possible functional disturbances arising from these changes.</p>
      <p>Because patients with CLP have a high prevalence of dental anomalies in number, shape
and position, especially in teeth adjacent to the alveolar cleft, rehabilitation
frequently involves dental procedures in the anterior maxilla that require
anesthesia<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, such as restorations, scaling and root planning or even
extractions. Knowledge of normal anatomy<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> favors the understanding of changes determined by a cleft, which may
impair clinical procedures, especially anesthesia. Thus, general dentists must adapt
their procedures to the abnormal morphology of the cleft maxilla.</p>
      <p>This paper discusses the innervation pattern seen in the cleft area and presents the
management of 2 cases to demonstrate that the general dentist can carry out the
anesthetic procedure effectively in patients with CLP, without causing discomfort.</p>

        <p>A 20-year-old male patient with a complete unilateral CLP was seen at the
Orthognathic Surgery Clinic of the Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial
Anomalies, University of S&#xE3;o Paulo, Brazil, for extraction of the pre-canine
supernumerary tooth adjacent to the cleft for prosthetic rehabilitation purposes
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">1B</xref>).</p>

        <p>After skin and oral antisepsis with 0.12% chlorhexidine (PerioGard<sup>&#xAE;</sup>,
Colgate-Palmolive, S&#xE3;o Bernardo do Campo, SP, Brazil), a topical anesthetic gel with
20% benzocaine (Benzotop, DFL, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil) was applied at the bottom
of the vestibule to reduce pain during the regional injectable anesthetic procedure
(mepivacaine with epinephrine 1:100,000; Mep&#xED;adre, DFL).</p>
        <p>A first puncture was performed in the first premolar region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1C</xref>), away from the area to be handled in order to avoid a
puncture near the nose as a direct infiltration in this area is usually very painful.
Then, after approximately 5 min, when the area was partially anesthetized, a second
puncture was made at the apex of the tooth to be extracted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1D</xref>), in a slow and gradual manner, with the needle
inclined 45&#xBA; to the apex of the pre-canine tooth. Injections throughout the marginal
buccal mucosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1E</xref>) and palate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1F</xref>) were also performed. After the
anesthetic procedure, the tooth was extracted following the steps: intra-sulcular
incision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1G</xref>), dislocation and tooth
extraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1H</xref>) and, finally, suture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure

        <p>For anesthesia of teeth located on the margin of the right cleft, topical anesthetic
gel with 20% benzocaine (Benzotop, DFL) was applied at the bottom of the vestibule,
in the right maxillary segment and premaxillary areas. The first puncture, using 2%
lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100.000 (Alphacaine, DFL), was made in the premolar
region, avoiding the introduction of the needle in the area near the nose, which is
often very painful (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2B</xref>). A second
puncture was made in the right maxillary segment close to the buccal aspect of the
cleft and, in the third puncture, the tooth located on the right margin of the
premaxilla was anesthetized, with the needle inserted at 45&#xBA; toward the tooth apex
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2C</xref>). Infiltrations along the mucosa
in the buccal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2D</xref>) and palatal aspects
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2E</xref>) of the right maxillary segment
and premaxillary region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">2G</xref>, respectively) were made to promote greater
local anesthesia and hemostasia during the surgical procedure.</p>
        <p>On the left side, the anesthetic technique was very similar to the procedure
performed on the right cleft, i.e., first infiltration away from the cleft site
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2H</xref>), second and third infiltrations
in the cleft area inclined 45&#xBA; towards the tooth apex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2I</xref>) and anesthesia of the buccal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2J</xref>) and palatal mucosa
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2K</xref>). After anesthesia, tooth
extraction was conducted in a conventional manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figures 2L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">2M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">2N</xref>).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Although several studies have been conducted regarding the complex treatment procedures
in patients with CLP, only a few have focused on the course and anatomy of vessels and
nerves in the cleft maxilla and the required modifications in dental procedures
resulting from this anatomic variation<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>To the best of our knowledge, the classic study of Bohn<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> (1963) is the only one to describe nerve and vascular
supply in the cleft maxillary complex, based on an in situ assessment. That study, which
became a reference for further research, described innervation of the maxillofacial
complex of stillborn children suffering from CLP by means of histological analysis.</p>
      <p>According to Bohn<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> (1963), in
unilateral CLP, the nasopalatine nerve descends along the vomer, on both sides, and
reaches the pre-maxilla. From there, both nerves converge and form the median nerve that
runs through the cleft, innervating the soft tissue in the cleft area. A major nerve
branch stems from the nasopalatine nerve located on the cleft side and is responsible
for innervating the palatal mucosa. This branch penetrates the premaxilla reaching
primary and permanent anterior teeth, and the buccal mucosa. On the non-cleft side, the
nasopalatine nerve runs toward the palatal mucosa conferring sensitivity. In this
segment of the jaw, the upper alveolar nerve innervates the teeth and buccal mucosa. The
anastomosis between right, left and median nerves that take place in the cleft region
are responsible for sensitivity in this area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure
3</xref>).</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="jaos-20-01-0122-g03"/>
      </fig>
      <p>On the other hand, in bilateral CLP, nerve supply of the premaxilla and its teeth is
derived from bilateral bundles of nasopalatine nerve that follow a downward course along
each side of the vomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Figure 4A</xref>). Upon reaching
the premaxilla, the nasopalatine branches unite, forming the median nerve which runs
close to the median suture of the premaxilla in the palatal region and, at this point,
penetrates the premaxilla and sends terminal branches to the buccal mucosa and labial
frenum. The main branch of median nerve also sends ramifications to primary and
permanent incisor pulp and incisive papilla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Figure
4B</xref>)<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Patients with CLP have a higher prevalence of anomalies in number or shape of teeth
adjacent to the alveolar cleft<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. In
some cases, these teeth need to be extracted due to mispositioning or malformation and
local anesthesia is an important step for a successful extraction procedure, avoiding
distress to patients and professional anxiety. In face of anatomic variations in the
cleft maxilla, it seems obvious that adjustments to conventional anesthetic techniques
should be considered to perform surgical, endodontic or restorative procedures properly
in teeth located along the cleft.</p>
      <p>Four recommendations must be followed to fulfill a correct anesthetic technique in the
cleft area: <italic>1) use of topical anesthetics:</italic> it is important that the
professional always use a topical anesthetic in the region to be infiltrated. This can
be useful because surgical reconstruction of the lip performed in early childhood,
around 3 months of age, can leave scars that stretch during the anesthetic procedure,
promoting excessive pain, <italic>2) first puncture far from the cleft area:</italic> it
is recommended to make the first puncture in the canine or premolar region, avoiding
needle introduction in the area near the cleft or nose which is always painful. When the
area of interest is partially anesthetized, a second puncture can be performed in the
bottom of the vestibule, near the tooth to be treated or extracted, <italic>3) slow
administration of anesthetic:</italic> injection of anesthetic liquid must be as slow
as possible avoiding the painful sensation caused by distension of fibrotic scar tissue
present in the cleft area and, <italic>4) infiltration of local anesthetic in cleft
margins:</italic> local infiltrative techniques in the cleft's marginal gingiva serve
as a complement to anesthesia and promote increased local vasoconstriction, allowing a
procedure free of pain and bleeding.</p>
      <p>Special attention should be given to premaxillary anesthesia in bilateral CLP. As
previously described, innervation of this area stems from the median nerve, which
penetrates premaxillary bone, innervates anterior teeth and sends branches to the buccal
mucosa. Therefore, it is extremely important that, in addition to anesthesia at the
bottom of the vestibule, completion of anesthesia be performed in the palatal aspect of
the premaxilla, providing complete anesthesia of this area.</p>
      <p>Finally, it should be considered that, although the dental arch of patients with CLP may
appear normal after reconstructive surgery, the nerve course was embryologically
determined by the presence of the cleft, and is not corrected by plastic surgery.
Therefore, it is very important for the general dentist and for the oral surgeon to be
aware of the anatomic course of nerves in both cleft types - unilateral and bilateral -
and to use techniques that promote efficient anesthesia in order to ensure safety for
the clinical procedure and comfort for the patient, minimizing trauma arising from
inappropriate anesthetic procedures.</p>
