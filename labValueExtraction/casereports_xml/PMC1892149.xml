        <title>Clinical history</title>
        <p>The patient, a 31-year-old male, was evaluated at the
Mount Sinai&#x2013;Irving J. Selikoff Center for
Occupational and Environmental Medicine on 22
March 2005. He complained of shortness of breath
at rest and with exertion, dry cough, and cough
with phlegm. Additional symptoms included fatigue,
chest tightness, wheezing, and decreased ability
to perform physical activity. The patient had
begun experiencing breathing difficulty about 2
years before his initial visit, and his symptoms
had progressed over time. In 2004 he became more
symptomatic and was examined by a nurse
practitioner. He was diagnosed with bronchitis and
prescribed an albuterol inhaler,
salmeterol/fluticasone diskus, and oral prednisone
for several days. At the time, it was recommended
that he obtain a chest X ray, but he did not
follow up on this recommendation. As a result of
the above-mentioned treatment, his symptoms
partially improved and he continued to work,
albeit only part time because of continuing
respiratory symptoms. In the beginning of 2005,
the patient was examined by his primary care
physician, who sent him for a chest X ray and
referred him to a pulmonologist. The pulmonologist
then ordered a chest computed tomography (CT)
scan, bronchoscopy, and lung biopsy and referred
the patient to our clinic for evaluation. At the
time of his visit to our clinic, the patient was
not taking any medication.</p>
        <p>Review of systems was unremarkable. His past medical
history revealed orchidopexy at 9 years of age. He
denied having allergies to any medications or to
any other exposure. At the time of his visit he
was actively smoking 20 cigarettes/day on average;
he began smoking at age 11. He described himself
as a moderate drinker.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec sec-type="background">
        <title>Occupational history</title>
        <p>The patient had been a carpet and floor installer for 15
years. He began working at the age of 15 and he
had worked for different carpeting and flooring
companies, mostly small family businesses.</p>
        <p>The patient&#x2019;s major occupation was the
installation of new carpeting and the removal of
old carpets, stripping and patching floors using
cement and water, and scraping and cleaning
floors. In the process of his work, he used
adhesives and glues on floors. The patient
mentioned that there was usually a substantial
amount of talc present when installing new
carpeting. He was not familiar with any material
safety data sheets relevant to his job. The
patient had not received proper job training, and
he did not use any respiratory protection or other
personal protective equipment when doing his
work.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Physical examination</title>
        <p>On physical examination, the patient&#x2019;s blood
pressure was 120/75 mmHg, his pulse was 90
beats/min, and his respiratory rate was 28/min,
with a fast, regular but shallow breathing
pattern. His height was 6 feet and his weight was
158 lb, for a body mass index of 21.1
kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Examination of his head and neck
was normal. His lungs were clear to percussion and
auscultation, and examination of the heart showed
regular and rhythmic heart sounds and no murmurs.
His abdomen was soft to palpation, with no
tenderness. Liver span was normal, and no megalies
or masses were noted. An examination of the
patient&#x2019;s lower extremities revealed
normal peripheral pulses and no edema.
Musculoskeletal examination was normal;
neurological examination was nonfocal, and his
skin was clear.</p>

        <title>Laboratory and X-ray evaluation</title>
        <p>Chest X rays on 16 February 2005 showed a diffuse,
extensive, bilateral regular-nodular infiltrate,
with nodules measuring &lt; 5 mm in diameter.
Roentgenographic interpretation according to the
International Labour Organization (ILO)
classification for pneumoconiosis (<xref rid="b14-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">ILO
2002</xref>) revealed rounded regular opacities
classified as q/r in shape and size (q,
1.5&#x2013;3 mm; r, 3&#x2013;10 mm), located
throughout both lungs, with a degree of profusion
of 3/3 (on scale of 0/&#x2013; to 3/+) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ehp0115-000932">Figure
1</xref>). No large opacities were noted, and no
pleural abnormalities were described; coalescence
of small opacities was described. A chest CT scan
on 24 February 2005 revealed multiple nodular
lesions throughout both lungs, from the apices to
the bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ehp0115-000932">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0115-000932">3</xref>),
with coalescence of opacities and formation of
conglomerates in both upper lobes. No evidence of
consolidation or mediastinal or axillary
lymphadenopathy was seen, but it was noted in the
record that the hilar nodes could not be evaluated
because of the use of a noncontrast technique. No
pleural effusion was visualized. Occasional
bullous changes were described in the apices of
the lungs. Blood tests revealed a normal
C-reactive protein. The erythrosedimentation rate
was 10 mm/hr.</p>

        <title>Pulmonary function tests</title>
        <p>Pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry was performed on
22 March 2005. Prebronchodilator forced vital
capacity (FVC) was measured at 3.09 L (55% of
predicted), and prebronchodilator first-second
forced expiratory volume (FEV<sub>1</sub>) was
1.97 L (43% of predicted); the FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC
ratio was 64% (predicted 82%). Postbronchodilator,
the patient&#x2019;s FVC improved by 460 mL
(15%), and his FEV<sub>1</sub> improved by 1.02 L
(26%). This study was interpreted as a mixed
obstructive and restrictive impairment with
significant improvement after inhaled
bronchodilator.</p>

        <title>Pathology reports</title>
        <p>The patient underwent bronchoscopy with transbronchial
biopsy on 7 March 2005. Bronchoalveolar lavage was
negative for malignant cells, but the culture of
lavage was positive for <italic>Klebsiella
oxytoca</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium
avium-intracellulare</italic>. The transbronchial
biopsy was referred for consultation. The
pathologist reported</p>
        <disp-quote>
          <p>&#x2026; a dense interstitial histiocytic
infiltrate with numerous multinucleated,
foreign-body type giant cells. Numerous sheet-like
refractile and strongly polarizable particles are
present within the histiocytes. The appearance
fits with a form of silicate pneumoconiosis, most
likely of the type due to talc, although mica and
kaolin can cause a similar appearance.</p>

        <p>The nature and the implications of the diagnosis were
explained to the patient. The patient was urged to
stop smoking and advised to change his job and
avoid exposure to respiratory irritants. The
patient was referred for full pulmonary function
tests with plethysmography and diffusing capacity.
He received a prescription for an albuterol
inhaler, and his follow-up appointment was
scheduled at our clinic for 3 weeks after the
initial evaluation. It was further recommended
that the patient continue to follow-up with his
pulmonologist and primary care physician. Despite
multiple phone calls and written letters, the
patient did not attend any appointment, neither at
our clinic nor with the pulmonologist or his
primary care physician. The impression of the
treating physicians was that he had understood the
nature of his disease but was unable to follow
medical recommendations.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Based on medical and occupational history, physical examination,
and results of laboratory and pathology tests, this patient
was diagnosed with silicatosis, most probably talcosis. The
cause of his lung disease was thought to be related to his
working as a carpet installer.</p>
      <p>Silicatosis is a type of pneumoconiosis caused by a variety of
silicates from diverse environmental and occupational
sources (<xref rid="b15-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Kales and Mark 1995</xref>). Although silicatosis
is related to silicosis both clinically and pathologically,
it is usually milder than silicosis and less fibrogenic
(<xref rid="b29-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Silicosis and Silicate Disease Committee
1988</xref>). Silica is a mineral composed of
silicon and oxygen; silicates, in turn, originate when
silicon combines with other anions and oxygen (<xref rid="b23-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Morgan
1995</xref>). Inherent properties of silicates
make them useful as fire retardants, fillers, cation
exchangers, catalysts, and construction materials for use as
building stone, road aggregate, and light-weight aggregate
for concrete (<xref rid="b28-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Short and Petsonk 1996</xref>). Examples of
silicates include bentonite, mica (potassium aluminum
silicate), feldspar (aluminum silicate with potassium and
sodium), talc (magnesium silicate), and kaolin (hydrated
aluminum silicate). Talc, which was recognized by the
pathologist who interpreted this patient&#x2019;s biopsies
as the most probable cause for the patient&#x2019;s
pneumoconiosis, is not a uniform material (<xref rid="b28-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Short and
Petsonk 1996</xref>).</p>
      <p>Talc can be tabular, granular, fibrous, or platy, but it is usually
crystalline, flexible, and soft. Commercial talc in the
United States comes from &gt; 10 states, with New York,
California, Texas, and Vermont being the major producers
(<xref rid="b23-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Morgan 1995</xref>; <xref rid="b28-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Short and Petsonk
1996</xref>). Commercial talc is usually
contaminated with other minerals. Talc has a wide variety of
uses: paint, paper, ceramics, cosmetics, roofing products,
textile material, rubber, lubricants, corrosion proofing,
fire-extinguishing powders, water filtration, insecticides,
dusting powders, spackling and patching compounds, and
asphalt products. More than 500 different products are sold
under the name of &#x201C;talc&#x201D; (<xref rid="b23-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Morgan
1995</xref>; <xref rid="b26-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Rom 1998</xref>).
Contribution from talc exposure to increased mortality due
to nonmalignant respiratory disease has been documented in
several studies of talc workers (<xref rid="b5-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Coggiola et al.
2003</xref>; <xref rid="b13-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Honda et al. 2002</xref>;
<xref rid="b32-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Wild et al. 2002</xref>). These studies confirm
an association between cumulative exposure to talc and
respiratory disease. However, even a relatively short,
intense exposure to talc can result in diffuse pulmonary
disease, with a latency period of more than 40 years (<xref rid="b12-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Gysbrechts et al. 1998</xref>). According to
<xref rid="b10-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Feigin (1986)</xref> and <xref rid="b26-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Rom (1998)</xref>,
talc-induced pulmonary disease has four distinct
manifestations, the first of which is talco-silicosis, which
is similar to silicosis. Second, talcoasbestosis, which
closely resembles asbestosis, is produced by crystalline
talc contaminated with asbestos fibers. Third, talcosis,
caused by inhalation of pure talc, may include acute or
chronic bronchitis as well as interstitial inflammation;
radiographically it appears as reticular or nodular
abnormalities, and functionally it causes small airway
obstruction. The fourth form is caused by intravenous
injection of talc. According to <xref rid="b23-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Morgan (1995)</xref>,
pure talc leads to a mixture of rounded and irregular
opacities that appear in the middle zones of the lungs and
are often perihilar in distribution. The opacities slowly
spread both up and down the lung fields. Large opacities
that result from coalescence of the small opacities may be
present. In CT scans of talc pneumoconiosis, the predominant
abnormalities have been described as small centrilobular and
subpleural nodules and conglomerated masses containing focal
areas of high attenuation (<xref rid="b4-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Chong et al. 2006</xref>;
<xref rid="b20-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Marchiori et al. 2004</xref>). Pulmonary function
studies of patients with talcosis reveal restrictive,
obstructive, or mixed patterns (<xref rid="b3-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Avolio et al.
1989</xref>).</p>
      <p>Kaolin, also known as China clay, is a soft white material that is
used in the manufacture of paper products, refractory
materials, and ceramics and as a filler in plastics, rubber,
and paints (<xref rid="b28-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Short and Petsonk 1996</xref>). In kaolin
workers, chest radiographic manifestations are those of
rounded and irregular opacities, and pulmonary function
studies show reductions in FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, and peak
flow rates. The potential for kaolin dusts to induce lung
damage in the absence of crystalline silica contamination is
not universally accepted (<xref rid="b28-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Short and Petsonk
1996</xref>). Some researchers, however, believe
that pure kaolin, in the absence of silica, can induce
pneumoconiosis, usually nodular in appearance, with the
possibility of coalescence and formation of large opacities
(<xref rid="b23-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Morgan 1995</xref>). Kaolin is far less
fibrogenic than silica and is not associated with
significant ventilatory impairment (<xref rid="b23-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Morgan 1995</xref>). Mica
has electrical and thermal properties that make it useful as
liner for steam boilers, in optical instruments, in oil-well
drilling, as artificial snow and flocking for Christmas
ornaments, in roofing material, as a filler for asphalt and
plaster, in ceiling tile and wallboard joint cements, and in
electrical insulation (<xref rid="b28-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Short and Petsonk
1996</xref>).</p>
      <p>Mica dust can cause pneumoconiosis (<xref rid="b28-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Short and Petsonk
1996</xref>; <xref rid="b33-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Zinman et al.
2002</xref>), characterized by nodular and reticular
infiltrates especially in the lower lung fields. However,
pneumoconiosis due to mica appears to be rare (<xref rid="b23-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Morgan
1995</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our patient&#x2019;s trade was carpet and floor layering. Carpet
installation requires basic carpentry skills and physical
strength. Installing carpeting and juxtaposition of seams
requires the use of adhesives, which are applied with a
trowel to the underlying floor. These adhesives may contain
acrylic resins (acrylates and methacrylates), styrene,
butadiene, rubber latex, and halogenated hydrocarbons.
Exposure to products used in carpet layering has been
associated with skin, eye, upper and lower respiratory, and
central nervous system effects, as well as with
musculoskeletal disease (<xref rid="b22-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Medora 1997</xref>). Our
patient, in relation to his clinical diagnosis, mentioned
that there was a substantial amount of talc present when
installing new carpets. Talc is cited in some commercial
sites as a carpet backing and as filler when preparing
subfloors for carpet installation (<xref rid="b9-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Eager Plastics Inc.
2006</xref>). Exposure to methacrylates can result
in hypersensitivity pneumonitis, as has been reported
especially in dental technicians (<xref rid="b27-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Scherpereel et al.
2004</xref>). Although hypersensitivity
pneumonitis may cause radiographic abnormalities, usually
the shape, size, and degree of these would not be as
extensive as the ones seen in our patient. In addition,
pathology studies would not show polarizable particles in
such cases.</p>
      <p>Cultures from bronchial lavage of our patient were positive for
<italic>M. avium-intracellulare</italic> and
<italic>K. oxytoca</italic>. Both typical
tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteriosis have been
described as a complication of pneumoconiosis. The
association between silicosis and tuberculosis, for example,
has been described since the times of Agricola in the
sixteenth century (<xref rid="b30-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Snider 1978</xref>). The
incidence of mycobacterial infection among patients exposed
to high concentration of silica has been estimated at 25%
(<xref rid="b11-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Fujita et al. 2004</xref>). Studies have
confirmed that tuberculosis is a major cause of morbidity
and death among silicotics; the risk of tuberculosis
infection and disease is higher in silicotics than in the
general population; the incidence of active tuberculosis in
chronic silicosis increases in direct proportion with the
increase in profusion of silicotic nodules; and the presence
of tuberculosis accelerates lung damage caused by silica
particles [<xref rid="b1-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">American Thoracic Society (ATS) 1997a</xref>;
<xref rid="b30-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Snider 1978</xref>; <xref rid="b34-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Ziskind et al.
1976</xref>]. This increased susceptibility to
tuberculosis among silica patients has been explained by
silica-induced reduction in cell-mediated immunity with
alteration in lymphocyte subsets and serum immunoglobulin
levels (<xref rid="b25-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Rimal
et al. 2005</xref>) or by impaired function of
lung macrophages due to silica (<xref rid="b19-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Lowrie 1982</xref>).</p>
      <p>Nontuberculous mycobacteria disease accounts for a considerable
proportion of the mycobacterial disease seen in silicotic
patients, especially in the industrialized world, and has
also been linked to worsening the clinical course of
silicosis (<xref rid="b1-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">ATS
1997a</xref>; <xref rid="b6-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Corbett et al.
1999</xref>; <xref rid="b11-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Fujita et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="b34-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Ziskind et al.
1976</xref>). Nontuberculous mycobacterial
infection has also been reported in talcosis (<xref rid="b7-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">De Coster
et al. 1996</xref>). The ATS has published
diagnostic criteria for disease caused by nontuberculous
mycobacteria (<xref rid="b2-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">ATS 1997b</xref>). Radiographic features that
strongly suggest tuberculosis in patients with silicosis
include a rapid progression of X-ray abnormalities,
especially in the upper lung fields; the appearance of a
cavity; the development of bronchial stenosis or occlusion
or of pleural or pericardial effusion; and the presence of
any massive unilateral, nonretractile opacity (<xref rid="b11-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Fujita et
al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="b30-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Snider 1978</xref>). Most
patients with mycobacterial-disease&#x2013;complicating
pneumoconiosis present with clinical signs and symptoms such
as fever, night sweats, malaise, and worsening respiratory
findings (<xref rid="b30-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Snider 1978</xref>), although the disease could
be paucisymptomatic in many patients (<xref rid="b31-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Solomon 2001</xref>). A
recent review of nontuberculous mycobacteria isolation in
respiratory samples of non-AIDS adult patients showed that
only 16% of those patients in whom a positive sample for
nontuberculous mycobacteria had been identified were
ultimately diagnosed with pulmonary disease (<xref rid="b21-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Marinho
et al. 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the patient in the present study, we felt that the absence of
clincal signs, of worsening pulmonary radiographic
infiltrates, and of frank granuloma formation in the
pulmonary biopsy strongly argued against active
myco-bacterial infection being the cause or contributing to
the nodules observed in the films. In addition, with the
available information, we determined that this patient did
not fully fulfill the criteria for diagnosing nontuberculous
mycobacterial lung infection, as recommended by the ATS.
However, we cannot rule out a role of mycobacterial
infection in causing the degree of profusion of
abnormalities shown in this case. The patient&#x2019;s
pulmonologist also agreed with this conclusion, and stated
that the patient &#x201C;may need treatment&#x201D; in the
future.</p>
      <p>Cultures of bronchial lavage in this patient also showed <italic>K.
oxytoca,</italic> an opportunistic pathogen found
in the environment and in mammalian mucosal surfaces.
<italic>K. oxytoca</italic> is usually related to
antibiotic-associated diarrhea and nosocomial infections
(<xref rid="b8-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Decre et al. 2004</xref>). Given the fact that at
no time did the patient present any signs of acute
infection, the above findings point to contamination as the
most probable cause of this culture result.</p>
      <p>Upon reviewing this patient&#x2019;s occupational history,
clinical presentation, and pathology results, it appears
that exposure to talc in the course of his occupation as a
carpet layer resulted in nodular opacities in the chest CT
scan that were further identified as silicate pneumoconiosis
on lung biopsy. To our knowledge, this is the first report
of such association.</p>
      <p>This young patient presented severe pulmonary radiographic and
functional findings. In addition to his occupational
exposure, he reported a significant smoking history. Most
likely, concurrence of smoking from an early age and his
occupational exposure contributed to the expression and
progress of his disease. Association of smoking and asbestos
exposure, for example, has shown that smokers have greater
disease magnitude than equally exposed nonsmoking workers
(<xref rid="b16-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Kilburn et al. 1986</xref>; <xref rid="b17-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Kilburn and Warshaw
1992</xref>; <xref rid="b24-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">Ohar et al. 2004</xref>).
In silicosis, obstructive impairment in pulmonary function
testing is caused by chronic bronchitis as a result of
nonspecific dust effects and smoking (<xref rid="b18-ehp0115-000932" ref-type="bibr">LaDou 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>In summary, in this case of a young carpet installer who was
diagnosed with silicatosis of the lung, a review of his
occupational history revealed that the patient was exposed
to talc in the course of his occupation. Carpet installation
should be added to the causes of pneumoconioses,
specifically silicatosis of the lung.</p>
