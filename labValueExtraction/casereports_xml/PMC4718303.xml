        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) describes a depression of oxidative metabolism glucose and blood flow in the cerebellum secondary to a supratentorial lesion in the contralateral cerebral hemisphere. PET/MR has the potential to become a powerful tool for demonstrating and imaging intracranial lesions .We herein report 3 cases of CCD imaging using a tri-modality PET/CT&#x2013;MR set-up for investigating the value of adding MRI rather than CT to PET in clinical routine.</p>
        <p>We describe 3 patients with CCD and neurological symptoms in conjunction with abnormal cerebral fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (PET/CT&#x2013;MR) manifestations including arterial spin-labeling (ASL) and T2-weighted images. In all, <sup>18</sup>FDG-PET/CT detected positive FDG uptake in supratentorial lesions, and hypometabolism with atrophy in the contralateral cerebellum. More than that, hybrid PET/MRI provided a more accurate anatomic localization and ASL indicated disruption of the cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway.</p>
        <p>Using pathology or long-term clinical follow-up to confirm the PET and ASL findings, the supratentorial lesions of the 3 patients were respectively diagnosed with cerebral infarction, recurrent glioma, and metastasis.</p>
        <p>The reports emphasize the signi&#xFB01;cance of multimodality radiological examinations. Multimodality imaging contributes to proper diagnosis, management, and follow-up of supratentorial lesions with CCD.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) is characterized by loss of functional activity and metabolism in the cerebellum contralateral to the supratentorial lesion. This phenomenon has been observed in patients with cerebral infarction,<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> supratentorial tumors,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> epilepsy,<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> encephalitis,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and as a result of disruption of the cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway. It has been previously described on single-photon emission CT (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans but has rarely been reported on PET/ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations.</p>
      <p>The trimodality PET/CT&#x2013;MR system offers a novel technique using the 3 different imaging modalities in 1 patient virtually at the same time.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In this report, we aimed to characterize CCD with different supratentorial lesions by PET/MRI in comparison with PET/CT. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board.</p>

        <title>Case 1</title>
        <p>A 61-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for unilateral limb weakness after suffering a stroke. She had a 15-year history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled by subcutaneous insulin injection. The neurologic examination revealed that the left nasolabial groove became shallow and the tongue was deviated to right, as well as both Babinski sign positive, without sign of meningeal irritation.</p>
        <p>Axial PET images revealed a marked reduction in cortical and subcortical glucose metabolism in the right hemisphere (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). On axial diffusion-weighted image, the frontal lesion demonstrated high signal illustrating a significant diffusion restriction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). This evaluation was performed on a hybrid PET/CT-MRI scanner combining a 3.0 T MRI (Discovery 750w 3T, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, USA) and a TOF PET/CT (Time of flight, Discovery 690, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, USA). PET/CT, PET/MRI, PET-only or CT-only images can be acquired on a dedicated review workstation (Advantage Windows 4.6, GE Healthcare). Axial FDG PET fused with FSE T2 images of this patient showed the infarction of right hemispheric (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C). Fused PET/MRI (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D) and PET/CT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E) images demonstrated hypometabolism in the contralteral cerebellar hemisphere. Both modalities exhibited similar diagnostic image quality whereas the former offered higher soft-tissue contrast. The axial FSE T2 image confirmed no significant changes or sign of atrophy in the cerebellum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>F). The patient was eventually proved to acute cerebral infarction associated with CCD.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>CCD, first introduced by Monakow in 1914,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> is characterized by hypometabolism and functional deactivation in the cerebellar hemisphere contralateral to the supratentorial lesion. Several nuclear medicine-based studies have proven that the severity of CCD appears to be an valuable prognostic marker for recovery and treatment response.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> This phenomenon of diaschisis often resolves with time whereas the mechanisms are still unknown.</p>
      <p>To date, most cases of CCD were reported using SPECT, PET, computed tomography perfusion,<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI <sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and arterial spin-labeling (ASL) perfusion technique.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been only 1 case report that described the findings of CCD after stroke with hybrid PET-MRI imaging<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> until now. For our cases, we initially used an advanced trimodality PET/CT&#x2013;MRI system, which transferred the patient on a described dedicated shuttle from 1 room into the other.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Advantages of this set-up include the true CT-based attenuation correction, suitable MR sequences for diagnostic purposes, and reliable PET-quantification. Molecular imaging, traditionally by PET/CT and SPECT images, demonstrate a reduced metabolism and perfusion in the cerebellum contralateral to the cortical lesions.</p>
      <p>Exploring the relationship between lesion location, volume, and the occurrence of CCD was not the major purpose of our reports owing to the small sample. All cases emphasize the diagnosis value of functional PET/MRI images, especially in case 2, which make it easier to correlate between PET and MR images and provided a more accurate anatomic localization of the lesions than the unenhanced PET/CT images. Several publications also investigated the superiority of PET/MRI versus PET/CT in the detection and conspicuity of intracranial lesions.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> It is worth mentioning that PET images of all presented showed hypometabolism in the homolateral basal nuclei and thalamus, whereas the FSE T2 image and FLAIR MRI done at the same time demonstrated no significant change. In addition, case 3 indicates that the frontal cortical edema can also lead to CCD although the metastasis itself is small and located in the subcortical region. None of the studies reported before has, however, mentioned this phenomenon observed in CCD. Morphologic changes, in particular, crossed cerebellar atrophy (CCA), occurs only in the case 2. Tien et al<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> indicated that CCA usually appears in conjunction with large supratentonal diseases for which many cortico-pontine-cerebellar tract fibers were interrupted.</p>
      <p>Even more important, the PET images can be applied in conjunction with structural, perfusion-weighted, and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging by using the trimodality system. The noncontrast-enhanced perfusion sequences (ASL) acquired in case 3 well demonstrated crossed cerebellar hypoperfusion. In CCD, this hybrid technology in a single imaging session indicates the morphologic changes of the neural pathway as well as the associated metabolic and perfusion depression of the cerebellum.</p>
      <p>In summary, we report 3 cases of CCD with different supratentorial lesions detected by a noval PET/CT&#x2013;MR system. With advantages in the simultaneous assessment of the anatomic and metabolic alterations, this trimodality system seems to be an ideal tool for the detection and follow-up of CCD.</p>
