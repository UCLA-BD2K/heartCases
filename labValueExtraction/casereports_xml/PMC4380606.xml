      <abstract>
        <p>Sandblasting is traditionally known as a high-risk profession for potential
development of lung silicosis. Reported is a case of a sandblaster with confirmed
accelerated silicosis, a condition rather rarely diagnosed in the Czech Republic.
Initially, the patient presented with progressive dry cough and exertional dyspnoea. In
the early diagnostic process, a possible occupational aetiology was considered given his
occupational history and known high-risk exposure to respirable silica particles confirmed
by industrial hygiene assessment at the patient&#x2019;s workplace. The condition was confirmed
by clinical, histological and autopsy findings. The patient died during lung
transplantation, less than five years from diagnosis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Silicosis is a fibrotic disease of the lungs caused by the inhalation and deposition of
free crystalline silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) or silica in the lung tissue<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It falls into the group of pneumoconioses.
Silica exposure has long been a well-known occupational hazard in sandblasting, tunnelling,
mining, but also in a range of other professions. Although silica-associated diseases are
preventable, they remain common worldwide, particularly in developing countries<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>There are several clinical and pathologic varieties of silicosis, including acute
silicosis, accelerated silicosis, chronic silicosis, and conglomerate silicosis (progressive
massive fibrosis or complicated silicosis)<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Development of different forms of silicosis is dependent on
duration of exposure, concentration and the surface of silica particles<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chronic (nodular) silicosis that develops after 10&#x2013;20&#x2005;yr of
exposure to silica is the most frequent form of the disease<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Acute and accelerated silicosis are less common, particularly in
developed countries. Acute silicosis is also referred to in the literature as
silicoproteinosis or silicolipoproteinosis, because of its typical histological pattern of
periodic acid-Schiff-positive lipoproteinaceous material in the alveoli, producing a picture
of alveolar lipoproteinosis. Whereas acute silicosis occurs after intense short exposures
within a few years after the initial exposure, accelerated silicosis develops within 5 to
10&#x2005;yr of initial exposure to silica dusts<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>Radiologically, classic simple chronic silicosis is typically characterized by multiple
nodular opacities with predominance in the upper lobe and posterior part of the lung. With
increased duration and intensity of exposure, the silicotic nodules expand and become
confluent, resulting in a complicated form<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Enlargement of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes with calcification
at the periphery of the node is common<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Accelerated silicosis may be radiologically similar to chronic silicosis, with more rapid
development of changes following initial exposure. However, it may also possess features
typical for acute silicosis<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with
accelerated silicosis are at a higher risk of developing progressive massive fibrosis as
well as other complications<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In acute silicosis (silicolipoproteinosis), due to
intra-alveolar accumulation of lipoproteinaceous material, bilateral consolidation,
multifocal patchy ground-glass opacities with perihilar distribution and centrilobular
nodular opacities are usually described<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Sometimes, a crazy-paving appearance is present.</p>
      <p>Accelerated silicosis is similar to acute silicosis in developing alveolar lipoproteinosis
with accumulation of granular lipoproteinaceous material containing alveolar surfactant in
alveolar spaces and interstitial inflammation. In addition, accelerated silicosis is
associated with the presence of silicotic nodules that develop sooner than in chronic
silicosis<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>

      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>A 38-yr-old man presented with progressive dry cough and dyspnoea on exertion of 6-month
duration. His personal history indicated that he was a former smoker (10 pack-year cigarette
smoking history). He completed his apprenticeship as a metal processor and worked in this
profession for 2&#x2005;yr. For the next ten years, he worked as a locksmith and then, for the last
5&#x2005;yr prior to his disease, as a sandblaster. He used compressed air and foundry sand
containing high amounts of silicon dioxide to blast stainless steel materials before welding
or welded products.</p>
      <p>On admission, his physical examination was normal. A chest radiograph revealed a bilateral
reticulonodular pattern. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans showed
interstitial shadowing and diffuse small nodules, a subpleural reticular pattern and
mediastinal lymphadenopathy in all areas (subcarinal lymph nodes 29 &#xD7; 20&#x2005;mm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>HRCT scans at the initial presentation of the disease.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="indhealth-53-178-g001"/></fig>). The changes on HRCT scans had upper to mid zone predominance. Complete laboratory
examination revealed positivity of antinuclear antibodies, increased levels of lactate
dehydrogenase (25.9 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>kat/l), gamma-glutamyl transferase (2.8
<italic>&#x3BC;</italic>kat/l), circulating immune complexes (89 U), soluble IL-2 receptor (1252
kU/l), IgA (6.6&#x2005;g/l), IgG (21.2&#x2005;g/l), IgE (247 U) and tumour markers thymidine kinase (TK,
53.5 IU/l), tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA, 3.9 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/l), &#x3B2;2-microglobulin
(5.4&#x2005;mg/l), neuron-specific enolase (NSE, 68.0 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/l) and cytokeratin
fragment 19 (CYFRA 21&#x2013;1, 7.7 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/l). Functional testing revealed mild
restrictive ventilatory impairment (VC 3,550 ml = 76%, FEV1 3,000 ml = 80%, FEV1/FVC = 84%,
TLC = 67%) and the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) was moderately reduced
(40%). Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed which revealed a picture of
chronic bronchitis. Cytology of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) showed lymphocytic
alveolitis with a slightly increased percentage of eosinophils (lymphocytes 46%, eosinophils
1% and alveolar macrophages 53%), numerous pigmentophages, crystals and PAS-positive
amorphous material. The CD4/CD8 ratio was decreased (0.55). Polarized light microscopy
examination of BALF revealed birefringent crystals that conformed to SiO<sub>2</sub>.
Microbiological examination of BALF was negative.</p>
      <p>Morphologically, transbronchial lung biopsy confirmed a combined picture of lymphocytic
alveolitis and alveolar lipoproteinosis with a tiny silicotic nodule of up to 1&#x2005;mm. Diffuse
fibrosis of the alveolar septa had not yet developed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Transbronchial lung biopsy.</p><p>The picture clearly shows a silicotic nodule (asterisk) and lung tissue with
thickened alveolar septa infiltrated with lymphocytes and histiocytes. In the alveoli,
PAS-positive protein material is present, corresponding to surfactant in alveolar
lipoproteinosis (upper arrow). In some alveoli, there are optically empty spaces
previously occupied by cholesterol crystals (lower arrow). PAS staining, 100&#xD7;
magnification.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="indhealth-53-178-g002"/></fig>). Under polarized light, numerous microcrystals resembling SiO<sub>2</sub> were
observed.</p>
      <p>Six months later, HRCT showed slightly progressing bilateral diffuse interstitial
thickening and diffuse nodules with a diameter &lt;2&#x2005;mm, and stationary mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. Ventilatory impairment was worsened (VC 2,920 ml = 63%, FEV1 2,370 ml =
64%, FEV1/FVC = 85%, TLC = 62%), whereas DLCO was stationary (42%). The patient underwent
video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with biopsy of the mediastinal lymph node and left
upper lobe. Histological examination showed already diffuse fibrosis of the alveolar septa
with intensive reaction of intra-alveolar macrophages and apparently resolved lymphocytic
infiltrates. In some areas of the lung, alveolar lipoproteinosis persisted. Dispersed
individual silicotic nodules of up to 1&#x2005;mm were detected. In the subpleural region, compact
fibrosis with numerous cholesterol crystals had developed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>VATS biopsy.</p><p>Approximately 6 months after transbronchial biopsy. The subpleural lung regions
contain compact fibrotic lesions (asterisk) with numerous cholesterol crystals
(arrows). HE staining, 200&#xD7; magnification.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="indhealth-53-178-g003"/></fig>). The final histological findings were endogenous lipid pneumonia and alveolar
lipoproteinosis with hyaline nodules suggesting silicosis. Clinically, the condition was
defined as accelerated silicosis.</p>
      <p>Given his occupational history and the fact that the patient worked as a sandblaster which
put him at a risk for developing silicosis, after completion of the diagnostic process,
industrial hygiene specialists were asked for objective assessment of professional exposure
at his workplace. The assessment, completed approximately 10 months after clinical diagnosis
had been made, concluded that the patient had worked for at least 3&#x2005;yr and 2 months
(probably even as long as 5&#x2005;yr) as a sandblaster in a small closed room with neither natural
ventilation to the outside nor extraction. Moreover, for the first two years, he had only
been equipped with a respirator instead of adequate protective wear such as an air-fed
helmet with a filter. He had even been caught not wearing the protective helmet on three
occasions. Foundry silica sand was found to contain 99% of SiO<sub>2</sub>. Blasting
activity accounted for approximately 60% of his working time. Unfortunately, exact data on
dust loading associated with such massive exposure were unavailable as at the time of
assessment, the method was no longer used. However, quantification of workplace risk
conditions suggested a respirable fraction of SiO<sub>2</sub> of approximately
0.3&#x2005;mg/m<sup>3</sup>. With respect to the evidence and disease dynamics, the patient&#x2019;s
condition was recognized as an occupational disease.</p>
      <p>The patient was treated with systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 40&#x2005;mg daily initially)
for 9 months. In the first 2&#x2005;yr of the disease, the patient had several infections of the
upper and lower airways with fever and attacks of dry cough treated with antibiotics. After
2&#x2005;yr, significant signs of disease progression were revealed by chest X-ray and HRCT scans,
with more pronounced mediastinal lymph node enlargement, diffuse ground-glass opacities,
foci of consolidation, reticular pattern, nodules and pleural thickening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_004" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>HRCT scans after 2&#x2005;years of disease progression.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="indhealth-53-178-g004"/></fig>). The restrictive ventilatory impairment on spirometry was worsened (VC 2,100 ml =
45%, FEV1 1,880 ml = 51%, FEV1/VC = 90%, TLC = 50%). DLCO was moderately decreased (DLCO =
44%, DLCO/VA = 76%). During bronchoscopy, BALF with a slight milky appearance was obtained.
The BALF cytological findings were similar to those in the initial phase of disease. The
patient was diagnosed with exercise-induced hypoxemia and started on long-term home oxygen
therapy. Due to the milky appearance of BALF and presence of ground-glass opacities on HRCT
scans, progression of secondary alveolar proteinosis was considered. Therefore, whole lung
lavage of the left lung was performed with 5,000 ml of saline under general anaesthesia.
This brought no improvement of symptoms and findings on chest radiograph; the functional
parameters were even worse (VC =40%, FEV1 =38%, FEV1/VC =76%, TLC =46%; DLCO =33%).</p>
      <p>Considering the progression of the disease and the lack of treatment options,
transplantation of the silicotic lung was indicated. Bilateral lung transplantation was
performed. The patient died during the transplantation, less than five years from diagnosis,
due to massive pulmonary embolism. Autopsy confirmed the diagnosis of advanced silicosis. At
the autopsy, confluent hyaline silicotic nodules diffusely involving both lungs were
observed. In the nodules multinucleated cells with cholesterol crystals were found.
Furthermore, fibrosis of the alveolar septa and chronic inflammatory changes of the lung
interstitium were present.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Acute and accelerated silicosis are commonly associated with heavy exposure to silica dust
and usually occur in sandblasting, silica flour milling, surface drilling, tunnelling and
other crushing operations<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sandblasting
involves projecting a stream of abrasive particles, mostly silica sand, onto a target
surface by compressed air or steam<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. It
has been commonly used for abrasion of metal or glass. There have been reports of individual
cases of accelerated silicosis in foundry and masonry industries, such as an interesting
case of accelerated silicosis in small private agate mill workers in China<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge, numerous cases of acute/accelerated silicosis in Turkish denim
sandblasters have been reported since 2005<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The common denominators of circumstances of occupational exposure were small plants with
massive exposure to silica during sandblasting in closed and poorly ventilated rooms, long
working hours and absence of adequate protective equipment<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Histopathologically, accelerated silicosis is characterized by
picture similar to acute silicosis with developing alveolar lipoproteinosis and interstitial
inflammation, but in addition silicotic nodules are present<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Histological changes in our patient are similar to findings from
lung biopsy described in two cases of acute silicosis in sandblasters<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the first case, silicotic nodule composed mainly of
bundles of interlaced collagen with minimal inflammatory reaction and accumulation of
lipoproteinaceous material within the alveoli were found. In the second case, exudative
alveolar lipoproteinosis associated with chronic inflammation, thickening of alveolar septa
with hypertrophic and hyperplastic type II epithelial cells were described. In our case of
accelerated silicosis, two biopsies were performed. A combined picture of lymphocytic
alveolitis and alveolar lipoproteinosis with a tiny silicotic nodule of up to 1&#x2005;mm was
present in the first transbronchial lung biopsy. 6 month later, histological examination
showed already diffuse fibrosis of the alveolar septa with intensive reaction of
intra-alveolar macrophages, alveolar lipoproteinosis persisting in some areas of the lung,
and silicotic nodules of up to 1&#x2005;mm. Lymphocytic infiltrates already resolved. A great
limitation for comparison of findings in transbronchial and surgical lung biopsies is the
difference in the size of biopsy specimens, so a time progression of morphological changes
could not have been correctly assessed.</p>
      <p>According to the literature, increasing evidence shows that lung inflammation and apoptosis
are hallmarks of acute silicosis<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
animal models of acute silicosis, severe lung inflammation, alveolar lipoproteinosis,
apoptosis, induction of reactive oxygen species, production of proinflammatory
cytokine/chemokine, and tissue destruction were found<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The accelerated acute inhalation model also led to the development
of acute-like injury (e.g. apoptosis, inflammation, tissue destruction)<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Animal models have shown that genes regulating fibrosis,
oxidative stress, and metalloproteases contribute to both acute and chronic silicosis, but
proinflammatory cytokines are associated with acute but not chronic silicosis<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>Radiographic findings in our patient comprised features of both acute and chronic
silicosis, with the development of acute changes later in the course of disease. On initial
presentation, HRCT scans showed only interstitial thickening, diffuse small nodules and
mediastinal lymphadenopathy, characteristic for simple chronic silicosis. Apart from
progression of these radiographic findings, ground-glass opacities and areas of
consolidation typical for lipoproteinosis appeared after 2&#x2005;yr follow-up.</p>
      <p>Increased serum levels of tumour markers TK, TPA, &#x3B2;2-microglobulin, NSE and CYFRA 21-1 were
observed in our patient. Also neoplastic diseases (e.g. lung cancer, lymphoproliferative
disorders, lymphangitic carcinomatosis) were suspected in the current case due to the
elevation of tumour markers. However, tumour was histologically found neither in biopsy
samples nor at autopsy. Except for lung cancer, increased concentrations of tumour markers
have been shown also in benign pulmonary diseases, but only few studies have evaluated the
clinical significance of tumour markers in patients with silicosis<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In primary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, an increase in
CYFRA 21-1, carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 19-9, CA 15-3 and TPA was observed in serum and
BALF<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The elevation of tumour markers can be partly attributed also to
the presence of secondary alveolar proteinosis in this case of accelerated silicosis.
Recently a study has demonstrated increased serum concentrations of NSE and CA 125 in
silicosis patients without malignancy<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
NSE and CA 125 levels were significantly correlated with spirometric parameters and LDH
concentrations, thus predicting disease severity in silicosis patients<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. These results support the finding of significantly
increased levels of NSE in our case, whereas concentrations of CA 125 were in this patient
normal. The mechanism of tumour markers&#x2019; increase in silicosis patients without malignancy
is unclear. It is speculated that increased serum NSE concentrations in silicosis may
originate from hyperplasia of neuroendocrine cells in the silicotic lungs. The release of
NSE into the peripheral circulation may be facilitated by the increased alveolocapillary
membrane permeability<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>Whole lung lavage (WLL) is considered to be a therapeutic option both in silicosis and
pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. In silicosis patients WLL may remove large quantities of
dust, soluble materials, and inflammatory cells from the lungs and relieve respiratory
symptoms, but sustained improvement in lung function parameters has not been shown in a
clinical trial<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several studies have
reported WLL performed also in acute silicoproteinosis<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Karnak <italic>et
al.</italic> has described a case of acute silicoproteinosis treated with WLL leading to
significant clinical, physiological and radiological improvement<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The patient had no recurrence of the disease after the
treatment. In the study of Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> WLL has been shown as an effective
therapy especially for early and accelerated silicosis, but WLL should be used cautiously in
the treatment of advanced silicosis<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Lower progression rate on chest X-ray, slower decrease of functional parameters, improvement
of the cough and expectoration were found in the group of silicosis patients treated with
WLL<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, in our case WLL brought
no clinical or radiological improvement and functional findings worsened.</p>
      <p>Lung transplantation (LT) is a potential alternative for end-stage silicosis, especially
for young patients<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. LT for occupational
lung diseases is relatively rare<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Patients with silicosis represent 0.5% to 5% of all candidates for LT<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Singer
<italic>et al.</italic> have reported a 2-fold increased mortality risk in subjects
undergoing LT for occupational lung diseases<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. This risk of death was limited to the patients with non-silicotic
occupational lung diseases in the first post-transplantation year. These observations differ
from an earlier single-centre report of poorer post-LT survival of patients with silicosis
in comparison with subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Unfortunately,
in the current case of accelerated silicosis neither LT led to a therapeutical success.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>In the current case, a rare diagnosis of accelerated silicosis was confirmed by diagnostic
considerations and methods. Initially, the patient presented with progressive dry cough and
exertional dyspnoea. Given his occupational history and known high-risk exposure to
respirable silica particles in his profession of a sandblaster, a possible occupational
aetiology was considered in the early diagnostic process. Eventually, this was confirmed by
histological, clinical, hygiene and autopsy findings.</p>
      <p>Although accelerated silicosis is a rare disease, it may be seen today, even in series of
cases related to &#x201C;new&#x201D; professions such as denim sandblasting. An important factor is always
massive exposure to respirable silica particles, frequently potentiated by unsatisfactory
hygienic conditions in the workplace. Given the poor prognosis of this condition, its
potential development in association with high-risk industries should not be underestimated.
Careful prevention measures are necessary, in the form of both the maximum possible
reduction of workers&#x2019; exposure at the workplace and the use of suitable and effective
protective equipment.</p>
