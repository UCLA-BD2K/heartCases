          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) is a rare cancer of the sinonasal tract with little molecular characterization. We performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) on paired normal and tumor DNA from a patient with metastatic-ONB to identify the somatic alterations that might be drivers of tumorigenesis and/or metastatic progression.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>Genomic DNA was isolated from fresh frozen tissue from a metastatic lesion and whole blood, followed by WGS at &gt;30X depth, alignment and mapping, and mutation analyses. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm selected mutations. Sixty-two somatic short nucleotide variants (SNVs) and five deletions were identified inside coding regions, each causing a non-synonymous DNA sequence change. We selected seven SNVs and validated them by Sanger sequencing. In the metastatic ONB samples collected several months prior to WGS, all seven mutations were present. However, in the original surgical resection specimen (prior to evidence of metastatic disease), mutations in <italic>KDR, MYC, SIN3B</italic>, and <italic>NLRC4</italic> genes were not present, suggesting that these were acquired with disease progression and/or as a result of post-treatment effects.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Previously called esthesioneuroblastoma, olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) is a rare cancer comprising 2% of all sinonasal tract tumors with an incidence of 0.4 cases per million <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Thompson1">[1]</xref>. ONB is thought to arise from sensory neuroepithelial olfactory cells typically found in the upper portion of the naval cavity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Thompson1">[1]</xref>. These tumors do not have a gender predilection and can occur at any age, but have a bimodal age distribution in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> decades of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Thompson1">[1]</xref>. The most common presenting symptoms include unilateral nasal obstruction (70%), and epistaxis (50%). Anosmia is not a common complaint (5%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Thompson1">[1]</xref>. ONB is a malignant tumor and &#x223C;25% of the patients develop cervical lymph node metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Koka1">[2]</xref>. Based on pathology, distinguishing features of ONB include nesting, neurofibrillary stroma and presence of stippled nuclei. Its distinct immunoprofile includes loss of keratin expression, immunopositivity for neuroendocrine markers, and S100 positive cells surrounding the nests of tumor cells. Despite all these distinguishing features, the wide variability in these tumors can lead to difficulty in diagnosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Faragalla1">[3]</xref>. Surgery and radiation with or without chemotherapy are considered the standard of care for non-distant metastatic disease based primarily on retrospective series <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Zanation1">[4]</xref>. While no standard chemotherapy exists for ONB, cisplatin and etoposide or doxorubicin, or vincristine with an alkylating agent are most commonly administered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Sohrabi1">[5]</xref>. However, after such treatment ONB often recurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Mao1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Due to the rarity of this disease, most of the published literature on ONB includes case reports or retrospective analysis of ONB patients to predict treatment outcome. There have been very few studies on the molecular characterization of ONB. Expression of Bcl-2, Trk-A and B, Grp78 and several other markers has been analyzed by immunohistochemistry by different groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Weinreb1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Kim1">[8]</xref>. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) has revealed multiple chromosomal aberrations in this tumor type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Guled1">[9]</xref>. The study by Guled <italic>et al.</italic> analyzed 13 ONB samples and revealed copy number changes including gains at 7q11.22-q21.11, 9p13.3, 13q, 20p/q, and Xp/q, and losses at 2q31.1, 2q33.3, 2q37.1, 6q16.3, 6q21.33, 6q22.1, 22q11.23, 22q12.1, and Xp/q <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Guled1">[9]</xref>. In addition, the Hedgehog signaling pathway has been posited to be crucial for ONB development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Mao1">[6]</xref>. A study by Koschny <italic>et al.</italic> showed that primary ONB cells are TRAIL (TNF related apoptosis inducing ligand) resistant but are sensitized to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. This sensitizing effect involves several regulators of the TRAIL signaling pathway. Both these anti-cancer agents are already in clinical use but their effect on ONB patients remain to be evaluated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Koschny1">[10]</xref>. Sequencing analyses have identified new genes and pathways that have not been previously linked to human cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Feero1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Beroukhim1">[12]</xref>. Apart from these studies there is little information on the genomic alterations or changes in cellular signaling in ONB patients. Thus, so far there has been no study to identify mutation profiles of these rare cancers in order to identify new therapeutic targets for treating these patients.</p>
      <p>It is universally accepted that somatic alterations (<italic>i.e</italic>., point mutations, small insertions and deletions, rearrangements, gains and losses) occur at the DNA level in cancer. These somatic events can drive tumorigenesis, metastatic progression, and/or drug resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Voidonikolas1">[13]</xref>. More importantly, specific somatic alterations are intimately tied to companion targeted therapeutics. Technological advances have been rapid and in 2007, the first genome sequence of a single individual was deciphered in only 2 months at a cost of less than $2 million <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Wheeler1">[14]</xref>. Researchers from the Wellcome Trust in UK published the entire genome of two cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Pleasance1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Pleasance2">[16]</xref>. These studies of a malignant melanoma and a lung cancer line, respectively, revealed for the first time almost all of the mutations in the genomes of these two cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Pleasance1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Pleasance2">[16]</xref>. In order to take full advantage of these technological advances, we have applied such capabilities in the clinic and translated them to the management of disease in individual patients. Currently, physicians have few choices when formulating a treatment plan for a patient with advanced cancer especially in case of rare cancers, as there is usually very little published literature about these diseases. Thus, we are far from understanding the genetics and disease progression in these diseases. As demonstrated, whole genome sequencing (WGS) technologies now provide us with platforms to interrogate entire human genomes at a fraction of the time and cost compared to more traditional sequencing technologies. These technologies, for the first time, offer us the ability to survey the global somatic landscape of cancer. It is now possible with WGS to re-sequence, analyze, and compare the matched tumor and normal genes of an individual patient. With these paradigm shifts in technologic capabilities, we present the results of the first paired tumor and normal whole genome sequences of metastatic ONB.</p>

        <title>Case Report</title>
        <p>A 29-year-old man with metastatic ONB presented to Virginia G. Piper Cancer Center Clinical Trials at Scottsdale Healthcare for participation in a pilot study to apply WGS on a fresh biopsy of one of his metastatic lesions to determine if identification of somatic perturbations might be useful for downstream therapy. The initial diagnosis of ONB was made after expert pathologic review at a major academic center. The tumor consisted of nests of closely packed cells with small to medium sized nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Within the nests, single cell and occasional necrosis was present. The tumor had features of epithelial differentiation confirmed by pankeratin staining, which highlights the clusters and single cells within the nests with strong cytoplasmic staining. The rest of the cells stain strongly for synaptophysin supporting the diagnosis of high grade ONB. The tumor was negative for chromogranin, neurofilament, CD45, CD20, S100, HMB45, and Melan A. Subsequently collected specimens also underwent confirmatory pathology review for the ONB diagnosis.</p>

          <p>3 &#xB5;g of genomic DNA from each sample (control and tumor) was used for library preparation. Samples were prepared for sequencing using proprietary methods. In summary, samples were fragmented using the Covaris S2 system (part#4387833) to a target fragment size of 300 to 350 base pairs (bp). Fragmentation was verified by running samples on a 2% Tris Acetate EDTA (TAE) gel. Overhangs in the fragmented samples were then repaired to form blunt ends using T4 DNA polymerase and Klenow (New England Biolabs; NebNext DNA Sample Prep Master Mix Set I; catalog # E6040L), and products were cleaned using Agencourt Ampure magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics; catalog # A29153). Adenine bases were next ligated onto the blunted fragments using Klenow exo (NebNext DNA Sample Prep Master Mix Set I), and A-tailed products were cleaned using Ampure magnetic beads. Products were next quantified using Quant-iT Picogreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen; catalog # P11496) in triplicate with a 0 ng/&#xB5;L to 200 ng/&#xB5;L standard. To prepare for adaptor ligation, samples were vacuum dried to the appropriate volume to allow for a 10&#x2236;1 adaptor to DNA molar ratio. Diluted paired end Illumina adapters were then ligated onto the A-tailed products using DNA ligase (NebNext DNA Sample Prep Master Mix Set I). Following ligation, samples were run on a 3% TAE gel at 120V for 2.5 hours to separate ligated products. X-tracta gel extractors (USA Scientific; catalog # 5454-0100) were used to select ligation products at 300 bp and 350 bp for each sample. Ligated products were isolated from these gel punches using Freeze &#x2018;N Squeeze DNA Gel Extraction Spin Columns (Bio-rad; catalog # 732-6166), and cleaned using Ampure magnetic beads. 2X Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Finnzymes; catalog # F-531L) was used to perform PCR in quadruplicate (10 uL ligation/reaction) to enrich for these products. Enriched PCR products were run on a 2% TAE gel and were selected using xtracta gel extractors. PCR products were purified from gel punches using Freeze &#x2018;N Squeeze DNA Gel Extraction Spin Columns.

Fastq files were validated to evaluate the distribution of quality scores and to ensure that quality scores do not drastically drop over each read. Validated fastq files were aligned to the human reference genome (build 36) using the Burrows-Wheeler Alignment (bwa) tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Li1">[17]</xref>, which uses the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) algorithm. Following alignment, generated .sai files were used to create .sam (sequence alignment map) files by converting suffix array coordinates to chromosomal coordinates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Li1">[17]</xref>. Resulting .sam files were input into SAMtools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Korbel1">[18]</xref> to create binary sequence (.bam) files.

          <p>SNP calling was performed using SolSNP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/solsnp/files/SolSNP-1.01/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/solsnp/files/SolSNP-1.01/</ext-link>) and Mutation Walker, a tool developed in house and that incorporates variant discovery tools from GATK. SNPs that were called using both tools were compiled for further examination. Two sets of thresholds, strict and lenient, were enabled to reduce the false negative rate. Data from each of these two sets were visually examined for false positives to create a final filtered list of true SNVs, which were annotated with GENCODE using an internal annotation script.</p>
          <p>SolSNP is an individual sample mutation detector implemented in Java. The algorithm is based on modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov like statistics, which incorporates base quality scores. The algorithm is non-parametric and makes no assumptions on the nature of the data. It compares the discrete sampled distribution, the pileup on each strand, to the expected distributions (according to ploidy). In the case of a diploid genome, both strands need to provide evidence for the variation. Zero quality bases are trimmed off the pileup before comparison. SolSNP is a standalone program that can be run from the command line and is general enough to work with any next generation sequencing data with high coverage. While making somatic calls, SolSNP&#x2019;s high quality genotype call is made for all callable loci of the normal sample. To reduce false negatives, variant loci in tumor samples are called with the Variant Consensus mode. Variant loci in tumor samples that exhibit a high quality homozygous reference genotype in the normal sample are considered as somatic. To call somatic variants, SolSNP is augmented by a Python script.</p>

          <p>Indel calling was performed using GATK and a somatic indel detection tool developed in house. For detecting somatic indels we employed a two-step strategy. In the first step, we removed reads whose insert size laid outside the interval (50,500) from the tumor bam files. GATK was then used to generate a list of potential small indels from this bam. A customized Perl script, which uses the Bio-SamTools library from BioPerl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Stajich1">[21]</xref>, takes these indel positions and for each of the indels, looks at the region in the normal sample that is 5 bases upstream from the start of the indel and 5 bases downstream from the end of the indel. An indel was determined to be somatic only if there was no indel detected in the region under consideration.</p>

        <p>Prior to the cancer diagnosis, his past medical history was significant for obesity. Pertinent past environmental exposure history included tobacco chewing for five years, and chemical or fume exposures in the work place (tool/dye shop). In early 2008, he presented with symptoms of sinus congestion, sore throat, headache, and unexplained vomiting. Evaluation and imaging at another institution revealed a 4.2 cm mass in the nasal cavity extending into the ethmoid and frontal sinuses. Biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of ONB. He underwent surgery involving both head and neck and neurosurgery consisting of an anterior craniofacial resection, sphenoidectomy, total ethmoidectomy, and transnasal craniotomy in June 2008.&#xA0;He then received radiation therapy 66.6 Gy over 37 fractions from June to September 2008 with concurrent carboplatin and vincristine. After radiotherapy, consolidation carboplatin and vincristine chemotherapy was delivered through March 2009.</p>
        <p>In June 2009, he underwent a dacryocystorhinostomy for epiphora, and showed no evidence of cancer. Subsequently, he had development of several local regional recurrences including nasal bridge recurrence in December 2009. He underwent extensive skull base surgery at the end of January 2010 including neck nodal dissection. One of 21 lymph nodes had microscopic metastatic disease and he had tumor that was extending to the ethmoid region to the orbital wall.&#xA0;After undergoing plastic reconstruction with a right forearm free flap, cranioplasty and skin grafting, radiation therapy (total dose of 54 Gy) was delivered to the right neck from March 2010 to May 2010. A right cheek metastasis measuring 3&#xD7;3 cm was confirmed by excisional biopsy in July 2010. He underwent a surgical debridement of the forehead flap in August 2010. In October 2010, tumor recurrence on the left ridge was confirmed by a biopsy and was visible on the bilateral nasal and ocular canthi, and suspected to involve the right parotid.</p>
        <p>At presentation to our clinic, he was on a liquid diet but could swallow pills. His main complaint was xerostomia, and he had anosmia, moderate fatigue, and frontal pressure headaches requiring opiate pain medication. His Karnofsky performance status was 80, and he had right-sided exophthalmos limiting his ability to fully close the right eyelid. Pertinent physical exam findings included several visible areas of metastases in the nasal ridge and orbital ridge, and a palpable hard, fixed mass in the right parotid region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0037029.s001">Figure S1A</xref> photos).

      <p>ONB is a rare cancer of the sinonasal tract and data on its molecular characterization is limited. We performed WGS on paired normal and tumor DNA from a patient with metastatic ONB in an attempt to survey the somatic alterations that might be drivers of tumorigenesis and/or metastatic progression in this disease. After validation of seven selected SNVs in the sequenced tumor sample, we analyzed archival metastatic and primary resection FFPE samples available from the same patient. We found that specific mutations in <italic>KDR</italic>, <italic>MYC</italic>, <italic>SIN3B</italic>, and <italic>NLRC4</italic> appear only in the metastatic setting, while mutations in <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>TAOK2</italic> and <italic>MAP4K2</italic> were also present in the previous samples (original biopsies of the ONB tumor). There was a mutation in codon 176 in the <italic>p53</italic> gene, which results in a residue change from a cysteine to a phenylalanine. Majority of mutations in <italic>p53</italic> occur in the core domain that contains the sequence-specific DNA binding activity of the p53 protein, and the mutations result in loss of DNA binding activity. The core domain structure consists of two loops (L2 and L3) and the LSH motif and this particular mutation (codon 176) is in the L2 loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Cho1">[28]</xref>. The L2 loop, although not directly involved in DNA binding, is involved in extensive interactions with the L3 loop for binding together zinc atom (Cys176 on the L2 loop is a ligand for the zinc) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Yamazaki1">[29]</xref>. In another study, tumors from 26 ONB samples microscopically more closely resembled paragangliomas, and aberrant expression of <italic>TP53</italic> was noted in 62% of cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Hirose1">[30]</xref>. Absence of <italic>TP53</italic> mutations in 14 ONB cases with hyper-expression of wild-type <italic>TP53</italic> was found in four metastatic/recurrent cases. One study suggested that <italic>TP53</italic> point mutations did not play an important role in the initial development of ONB as wild-type <italic>TP53</italic> hyper-expression may lead to local aggressive behavior and a tendency for recurrence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Papadaki1">[31]</xref>. Immunohistochemical analysis of one ONB case revealed that 10% of the tumor stained positive for <italic>TP53</italic> protein and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Miyagami1">[32]</xref>. This mutation has been previously associated with several other cancer types including oral cancers and Ewing&#x2019;s sarcoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Yamazaki1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Komuro1">[33]</xref>. In the study involving oral cancers, both the patients with this particular mutation died of the disease within 12 months <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Yamazaki1">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Similarly mutations in <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>KDR</italic>, though not as common as p53 mutations, have been previously described and associated with cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Bahram1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Antonescu1">[35]</xref>. Castaneda <italic>et al</italic> have shown N-MYC and MYC expression in a primary ONB sample by northern blot analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Castaneda1">[36]</xref>. Several of these genes/their protein products are known to interact/regulate other genes on the list and play important roles in cancer cell signal transduction. For example, MYC binds to SIN3B promoter directly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Dannenberg1">[37]</xref>. Similarly, p53 binds to NLRC4 promoter and activates its expression in a cell-type-specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0037029-Sadasivam1">[38]</xref>. Thus, it would be interesting to study these interactions <italic>in vitro</italic> in cell line model systems in which these genes were mutated.</p>
      <p>Our work has identified and validated seven mutations in an ONB patient. In addition, we tested these mutations in additional samples from the same patient. This work provides insight into the evolution of cancer cells and provides a window into the more complex factors at play here, including tumor clonality and multiple driver mutations. Based on these data it is clear that the tumor displays additional mutations. Normal course of disease progression could be responsible for their acquisition. Alternatively, additional mutations could have arisen in response to the primary radiation and/or carboplatin/vincristine chemotherapy as a mechanism of resistance. These mutations may have been present in the subclones of the primary tumor and selected for by dynamic tumor microenvironment. Lastly, as tumors from only one individual were sequenced we do not know which of the SNVs reported here are driver mutations as opposed to passenger mutations occurring by chance. All these hypotheses need to be tested in optimal <italic>in vitro</italic> model systems. Additionally, the mutated target genes and their cellular signaling mechanisms indicate aberrations in DNA repair mechanisms, which may be related to ONB progression in this patient. A limitation of this study is the lack of additional metastastic ONB tumors to assess by WGS. With the reduction in cost, improvement in speed of analysis and with more complete understanding of complex genetic alterations, we anticipate that WGS will be applied in the clinic more frequently to common and rare cancers and will pave the way to personalized medicine.</p>
