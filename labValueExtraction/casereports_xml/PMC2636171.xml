      <abstract>
        <p>The purpose of this article is to describe a rare benign tumor of
nerve sheath origin arising from the eyelid in an elderly male.
Local excision was done and histopathological examination
revealed a neurothekeoma. Six months later the patient was
doing well with no recurrence. The case was unique in that the
patient was an elderly male while neurothekeoma is commonly
seen on the face of young adults, especially females.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Neurothekeoma is a rare benign soft tissue neoplasm of
probable nerve sheath origin. They usually occur on the
face and extremities of young adults and show a female
preponderance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Only six cases of neurothekeoma have been
reported till date.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> We present here a case of
neurothekeoma on the eyelid in an elderly male.</p>
    <sec sec-type="">
      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>A 66-year-old man presented to the out patient department with
a painless swelling on the medial half of the right lower lid. It
was of insidious onset, gradually increasing in size over the
past eight years. Fine needle aspiration cytological examination
of the lesion yielded only blood and diagnosis could not be
established. He was a known diabetic and hypertensive, on
treatment for the past eight years.</p>
      <p>Examination of the lids and adnexa of the right eye revealed
a single, soft, non-tender swelling measuring 2&#xD7;1.9&#xD7;1 cm [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>]
with a lobulated surface, arising from the medial half of the
lower lid. The lower lid margin along with the punctum was
everted. The skin over the swelling showed prominent dilated
veins. The palpebral conjunctiva in the region of the swelling
showed keratinisation. Lid closure was adequate. No regional
lymph nodes were palpable. Rest of the ocular examination was
normal. The left eye was normal. The patient had watering of
the eyes due to the exposure. The mass was causing a cosmetic
deformity and so microsurgical excision with reconstruction of
the lower lid was planned under local anesthesia.</p>
      <p>A pentagon full-thickness resection of the tumor mass
with microscopically clear margins on all sides was done and
the tissue sent for histopathology examination. The defect
created by this resection was a little less than half of the
eyelid. Since the lower lid tissues were already stretched by
the presence of the tumor, lid repair was possible with lateral
cantholysis alone. The lid defect was closed in layers using 6-0
polyglactin sutures and the lids were apposed using a frost
suture. Routine postoperative care was given to the patient
and the frost sutures were removed after 48 h. The patient on
serial follow-up was normal at six months with no evidence
of recurrence.</p>
      <p>The resected mass was a multilobulated pale bluish lesion
[<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>] covered by thin, stretched skin. The lesion was dissected
by fibrous septae [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>] of varying thickness into nodular
masses. No adnexal structures of the eyelid were entrapped
in the mass. The lesion showed spindle-shaped and stellate
cells [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 3B</xref>] arranged in small fascicles in an alcian blue
positive myxoid stroma. In each nodule, fine wavy bundles
and swirling whorls of collagen (highlighted by reticulin
silver stain) enclosing the elongated Schwann cells and mast
cells were observed. The spindle and stellate cells expressed
S-100 protein [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, inset] confirming its nerve sheath origin.
Immunostatin for neurofilament revealed occasional clusters of
axons while the cells in the lesion were not immunolabeled for
antibodies to desmin and cytokeratin. No ganglionic cells were
found and the mitotic activity was very low. The features were
characteristic of neurothekeoma-myxoid variant. The presence
of axons and absence of entrapment of adnexal structures
with S-100 positivity of the cells differentiated this lesion from
superficial angiomyxoma which was a very close histological
differential diagnosis.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Myxoid neurothekeoma or nerve sheath myxoma is a rare
benign neoplasm of putative peripheral nerve sheath origin
first described in 1969 by Harkin and Reed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> and subsequently
termed &#x2032;neurothekeoma&#x2032; by Gallager and Helwig in 1980.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></p>
      <p>It often affects the skin with predilection for the face
and extremities of young adults. Females seem to be more
often affected than males. They are often solitary and may
be either asymptomatic or may present as a painful, raised,
skin-colored, well-circumscribed dome-shaped nodule less
than 3 cm in diameter. The tumor occurs in a myxoid or
classic variant, cellular variant and an intermediate (mixed)
variant,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> the myxoid variant being relatively common. This
lesion forms an important differential diagnosis for myxoid
soft tissue tumors, especially the benign ones. Although
excision is the mode of treatment for these benign myxoid
tumors, proper histopathological typing is needed as
some of these tumors like superficial angiomyxoma show
tendencies towards local recurrence and may be associated
with syndrome complex like association of superficial
angiomyxoma with Carney complex,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> an autosomal dominant
syndrome complex comprising myxomas of heart and skin,
hyperpigmentation of the skin (lentiginosis) and endocrine
overactivity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></p>
      <p>The myxoid neurothekeoma lesions are consistently positive
for S-100 proteins. Hence S-100 is considered to be a sensitive
immunohistochemical marker for neurothekeoma. They are also
known to be positive for vimentin but negative for cytokeratin,
desmin, CD34, SMA (smooth muscle actin). These lesions can
also sometimes show multinucleate cells, focal nuclear atypia,
foci of ossification and cartilaginous metaplasia.</p>
      <p>This case was unique in that the patient was a male in
the elderly age group. Although neurothekeoma is rare, the
clinician should consider this entity in the differential diagnosis
of solitary nodule of the eyelid, as it is imperative to distinguish
it from malignant lesions so that aggressive therapy can be
avoided. The treatment of choice is excision with clear margins
and no recurrences have been reported.</p>
