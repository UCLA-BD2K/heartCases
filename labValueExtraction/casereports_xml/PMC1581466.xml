      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Ludwig's angina, named after the German physician who described
the condition for the first time in 1948, is a rapidly spreading
cellulitis that may produce upper airway obstruction often leading
to death. The most common cause of Ludwig's angina is an
odontogenic infection, from one or more grossly decayed, infected
teeth, and is usually as a result of native oral streptococci or a
mixed aerobic-anaerobic oral flora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Additional possible
etiological factors include sialadenitis, compound mandibular
fractures, or puncture wounds of the floor of the mouth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].
While this is a life threatening infection, an extensive
literature search did not yield much published information
regarding this condition in the pregnant patient.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="case report">
      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 24-year old black female, G4P3, at 29 weeks gestation, was
presented to a local hospital complaining of facial swelling
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1(a)</xref>). The patient's only significant medical
history included history of anemia and sickle cell trait. She
described that her pregnancy had been proceeding without
difficulty, except for a three-day history of  lower left quadrant
tooth pain, and a one-day history of fever and chills. On
presentation, her vital signs were the following: temperature
38.5&#xB0;C, blood pressure 115/44, pulse 118/min,
respiratory rate 18/min, oxygen saturation on room air
96%, and white cell count of 16800/&#x3BC;L. Her clinical
presentation included large soft tissue swelling under her
mandible, extending bilaterally to the angles of the mandible and
inferiorly approximately down to her hyoid bone. Because of her
severe impending airway deterioration, she was flown by helicopter
to a tertiary medical center for definitive care. In the Emergency
Room of the University of Florida Shands Hospital, the diagnosis
of Ludwig's angina was made. It was difficult to perform an
adequate oral exam secondary to pain, swelling, and severe trismus
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1(b)</xref>) which allowed her to open her mouth to
only 15 mm (average range 40&#x2013;45 mm).  The patient was
having difficulty maintaining her own salivary secretions because
of dysphagea but denied dyspnea. Since in similar situations
patients can desaturate very quickly, even though her oxygen
saturation was recorded to be 96% on room air, she was given
supplemental oxygen and a pulse oxymeter was placed on her right
index finger because of possible impending quick respiratory
difficulties. Of note, although not used, an emergent
cricothyrotomy kit was available at the patient's bedside at all
times. The Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS)
formally consulted the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology
(Ob/Gyn) and Anesthesiology. Understanding that in administering
medications and/or undergoing any surgical treatment in pregnancy,
one must consider the risks and the benefits both to the mother
and the unborn, it was determined that the benefits of proceeding
with emergent and immediate surgical intervention outweighed the
risks. An emergent CT-scan showed fluid collections in the left
lateral pharyngeal space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) extending to the
level of the valleculae. Securing an airway via an awake
fiberoptic nasal intubation was risky: a fiberoptic tube inserted
into the pharynx might puncture an abscess and cause pus
aspiration or swallowing. Therefore, an awake tracheostomy was
performed using a 60-nonfenestrated Schiley endotracheal tube.  At
that time general anesthesia was administered and the patient was
placed in slight left lateral decubitus position to decrease
uterine aortocaval compression pressure. After usual sterile
preparation, lidocaine with epinephrine was infiltrated for local
anesthesia. An incision was made at the submental and bilateral
submandibular areas and blunt dissection to the lingual inferior
border of the mandible was carried out. Through the submental
incision, the blunt dissection continued through the mylohyoid
muscle to the sublingual areas to access all abscesses. Tooth
number 17 (lower left third molar) was then extracted since it was
believed that this grossly carious and partially impacted tooth
was the primary source for the infection. Upon removal, purulence
was expressed through the extraction socket. Five additional
grossly carious teeth were then extracted. Intraoral blunt
dissection to gain access into the lateral pharyngeal space
followed for drainage of another pus collection. Numerous Penrose
drains and red rubber catheter drains were left in place to
maintain drainage of pus and facilitate daily irrigation
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Upon admission to the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit, the Department of Ob/Gyn continued following up on the
patient by frequent monitoring of the fetal heart rate. The
patient was extubated after 6 days and remained in the hospital
until discharge the following day. On discharge, the patient's
progress was monitored by the Departments of OMFS and Ob/Gyn.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The unique anatomy of the floor of the mouth plays an important
role in the development and extension of intraoral infections. The
usual infectious course begins with a periapical dental abscess of
the second or third mandibular molar.  The roots of these teeth
extend inferior to the insertion of the mylohyoid muscle, so that
if untreated, the infection may continue from primary spaces to
penetrate the thin inner cortex of the mandible and will involve
the posterior margin of the mylohyoid muscle to the submandibular
space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].  At this time, the infection may develop and
progress at such an alarming rate that special precautions
regarding airway maintenance must be taken.  Because the mandible,
hyoid bone, and superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia
limit tissue expansion associated with the developing edema, the
floor of the mouth and the tongue base will become displaced
superiorly and posteriorly, resulting in severe airway compromise
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Further extension of the infection may spread into the
mediastinum and the carotid sheath resulting in severe thoracal
infection. Rupture of abscesses along the way may cause aspiration
of pus into the lungs and/or even pericarditis. Untreated, the
mortality is close to 100 percent, both from the acute
sepsis and from airway obstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].  The patient with
Ludwig's angina will have severe and obvious extraoral swellings
including bilateral submandibular, submental, and sublingual
spaces. Common presentation is elevation and displacement of the
tongue, trismus, drooling of saliva, airway obstruction, dysphagea
and/or dyspnea, and a hoarse (&#x201C;hot potato&#x201D;) voice.  With
extensive use of antibiotics, most facial infections improve
before they have a chance to progress to Ludwig's angina.  The
mortality rate from Ludwig's angina, when recognized, has
decreased from 50 to 5 percent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Therapy also includes
early surgical removal of the source of infection (which is often
grossly carious dentition) via extraction, aggressive, and
vigorous incision and drainage procedures with appropriate
placement of drains, along with intense and prolonged antibiotic
therapy and maintenance of a patient airway. While penicillin
administered intravenously and in high doses is the empirical
antibiotic of choice, it is often recommended to use metronidazole
as well. For patients who have had repeated episodes of dental
infections, clindamycin is often the antibiotic of choice
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p>
      <p>Each year it is estimated that about 50,000 women undergo
anesthesia and a surgical intervention at some time during
gestation for indications unrelated to the pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].  In
such situations, when medical and surgical treatments for pregnant
women are considered, both the physiologic changes of pregnancy
and the perinatal effects of the treatment must be considered
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Pregnancy is accompanied by many physiological changes
which place the mother at a higher risk of infection or of doing
worse once infected. First, the immune response is greatly
diminished during pregnancy, thus resulting in potential faster
progression of an infection. In addition, there is decreased
neutrophil chemotaxis, cell mediated immunity, and natural killer
cell activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Moreover, approximately 50% of pregnant
women complain of dyspnea by 19 weeks gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and there
is some depletion in the oxygen reserve of the gravid patient.
This results in lower oxygen reserve which could increase fetal
hypoxia during periods of hypoventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. From an oral
perspective, as pregnancy associated hormonal changes begin to
affect a woman's body, the gingival tissues are affected as well.
They become much more sensitive and thus susceptible to irritation
from soft plaque. The plaque accumulates, becomes hard calculus
deposits on the teeth, and harbors bacteria in large numbers
resulting in a constant, low-grade intraoral infection. An
exaggerated local inflammatory response can then begin and may
result in erythematous and edematous swelling of the gingiva
between the teeth, also known as pregnancy gingivitis.
Approximately 70% of pregnant women have this condition, even
with routine oral care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This condition may be slightly
painful and also bleeds easily upon routine tooth brushing.
Maternal infective processes sustained especially by gram negative
anaerobic bacteria, such as those leading to Ludwig's angina, have
been demonstrated to cause physiologic imbalance through
inflammatory cytokine production, sometimes resulting in preterm
labor, preterm premature rupture membranes, and low birth weight
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. During pregnancy, women tend to maintain frequent
meals and snacks, which cause further plaque accumulation, as well
as an increase in decay or rapid progression of previously present
decay. Because a pregnant patient has increased demands on her
organs, there is increased potential for poor
oxygenation. On the other hand, poor oxygenation is compromising
to the fetus. An infection in itself can at times infect the
placenta, uterus, and possibly the fetus, causing fetal
septicemia. Treatments such as prolonged intubation and certain
intravenous medications can also harm the fetus. During a life
threatening infectious situation such as the one described, the
risk of maternal and fetal morbidity may overshadow potential
teratogenic side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>In order to prevent a similar life-threatening emergency, health
care providers should not neglect even minimal complaints of
dental pain. Often, if a problem is identified during the early
stages of pregnancy, routine dental care can be planned to control
active disease or eliminate potential problems that could increase
in severity later in the pregnancy. An appropriate time for dental
care from a medical standpoint is the second trimester and
pregnant women usually experience the greatest sense of well being
during that time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Dental treatments including routine
cleanings, fillings, crowns, extractions, gum treatment, and
continuation of orthodontic treatment can all be provided.  Dental
anesthetics such as lidocaine can penetrate the placenta but, in
general, do not reach it because they are used locally and in
small dosages during routine dental procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].
Antibiotics that are acceptable include penicillin, amoxicillin,
and clindamycin. Tetracycline should be avoided since it tends to
cause permanent discoloration of primary and temporary dentition
of the unborn child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. To decrease dental pain, narcotics
should be avoided as well as over the counter medications such as
aspirin, ibuprofen, and related products because of the potential
to affect bleeding. Morphine appears to be a safe analgesic when
administered for short periods of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Ludwig's angina
is life threatening because of both septicemia and asphyxia.
Furthermore, in pregnancy, the risks that both the condition and
the possible therapies may cause the mother and her unborn child
must be considered as well as the possible consequences of the
condition and therapies to both.</p>
