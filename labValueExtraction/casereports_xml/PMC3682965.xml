      <abstract>
        <p>Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA) is a rare inherited disorder of the peripheral nervous system resulting from mutations in neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor 1 gene (<italic>NTRK1</italic>), which encodes the high-affinity nerve growth factor receptor TRKA. Here, we investigated the oral and craniofacial manifestations of a Chinese patient affected by autosomal-recessive CIPA and identified compound heterozygosity in the <italic>NTRK1</italic> gene. The affected boy has multisystemic disorder with lack of reaction to pain stimuli accompanied by self-mutilation behavior, the inability to sweat leading to defective thermoregulation, and mental retardation. Oral and craniofacial manifestations included a large number of missing teeth, nasal malformation, submucous cleft palate, severe soft tissue injuries, dental caries and malocclusion. Histopathological evaluation of the skin sample revealed severe peripheral nerve fiber loss as well as mild loss and absent innervation of sweat glands. Ultrastructural and morphometric studies of a shed tooth revealed dental abnormalities, including hypomineralization, dentin hypoplasia, cementogenesis defects and a dysplastic periodontal ligament. Genetic analysis revealed a compound heterozygosity- c.1561T&gt;C and c.2057G&gt;A in the NTRK1 gene. This report extends the spectrum of <italic>NTRK1</italic> mutations observed in patients diagnosed with CIPA and provides additional insight for clinical and molecular diagnosis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA, MIM256800) is also known as hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV (HSAN-IV). CIPA is a rare autosomal recessive disorder first described nearly 50 years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Dyck1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Swanson1">[2]</xref>. Thus far, several hundred cases of CIPA have been reported, and most of them are in pediatric patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Bonkowsky1">[3]</xref>. Primary clinical characteristics of CIPA include congenital insensitivity to pain, particularly in extremities and oral tissue, self-mutilating behavior, temperature-sensing defects, and mental retardation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Schalka1">[4]</xref>. CIPA-affected children fail to sweat, have unexplained episodes characterized by recurrent traumatic and thermal injuries, and are typically below-average height and weight for their age. Their self-mutilating behavior primarily involves the orofacial region. Oral manifestations include premature tooth loss, lacerations and ulcerations of oral soft tissues, limited ability to open the mouth due to intra-oral scarring, severe dental attrition and tooth luxation, and a high incidence of dental caries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Schalka1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Butler1">[5]</xref>. To our knowledge, dental histopathological manifestations have never been reported, and it is still unclear whether oral and dental phenotypes are associated with corresponding histopathological abnormalities.</p>
      <p>The diagnosis of CIPA is usually based on clinical examination and neurological evaluations. Neuropathological studies have revealed a severe loss of unmyelinated and small-diameter nerve fibers of the afferent neurons, defective development of small nociceptive neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and the abnormal innervation of eccrine sweat glands by cholinergic sympathetic fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Kaplan1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Kaplan2">[7]</xref>. Some studies have demonstrated an association between mutations in the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 (<italic>NTRK1</italic>) and CIPA. The <italic>NTRK1</italic> gene encodes the high-affinity receptor for NGF regulating the neural development and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Klein1">[8]</xref>. To date, more than 50 <italic>NTRK1</italic> mutations have been reported in different ethnic groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Mardy1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Li1">[10]</xref>. The present paper reports the oral and craniofacial manifestations of a Chinese child with CIPA and reveals two new missense mutations within the <italic>NTRK1</italic> gene.</p>

        <title>Clinical finding</title>
        <p>The patient was born after a normal pregnancy and delivery. From the third month of life onward, he experienced recurrent unexplained fevers. An absence of sweating with dry warm skin was consistently noted during the febrile periods. Meanwhile, he was also diagnosed with congenital corneitis and submucous cleft palate. The patient began biting his tongue and fingers after his teeth erupted at the age of 8 months. His parents and physicians began to suspect a developmental abnormality when he failed to cry during immunization or other painful stimuli although he could feel pressure and touch. His height and weight were below normal for his age. Other members of the patient's family did not show similar clinical symptoms.</p>
        <p>Clinical examination revealed that the proband presented a developmental delay. Scratch marks, erosions and cicatrization healing (scars) due to self-inflicted soft tissue trauma were seen on his face. He had congenital nasal defects, including depressed nasal bridge, malformed nasal apex, narrow nostril, dysmorphic columella and deviated nasal septum. And he had skin erosions on the left nasal alae and corneal ulcerations in the right eye as a result of scratching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066863-g001">Figure 1</xref>-A, B). A cranial CT scan showed a submucous cleft palate and alveolar bone loss of the maxilla and mandible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066863-g001">Figure 1</xref>-C). His hands and fingers also showed signs of biting. The tips of his right index fingers were missing, he was exhibiting amputations of the fingers caused by osteomyelitis in the distal region, and the left digitus minimus extended outward due to old fractures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066863-g001">Figure 1</xref>-D). Radiographs of the hand and wrist bones suggested that the bone age measurement was normal for his age and proved his bone fracture histories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066863-g001">Figure 1</xref>-E). Xerosis, thick and calloused skin, lichenification of the palms, dystrophic nails, and areas of hypotrichosis on the scalp were present in the patient. The proband presented with waddling gait- exaggerated alternation of lateral trunk movements with an exaggerated elevation of the hip, caused by valgus knee and hypotonia.</p>

        <p>Sensory examination revealed that pain and temperature sensing were absent, while deep tendon reflexes and his sense of touch were primarily intact. Electrophysiological studies suggested a peripheral neuropathy that was predominantly axonal and sensory and that showed greater involvement of the lower than the upper limbs. Electromyography and motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities were within normal limits. An intradermal injection of 0.05 ml 1&#x2236;1000 histamine solution resulted in the expected weal without any axon flare. No sweat was formed upon sweat induction with pilocarpine. Psychomotor development tests performed on Vienna Test System (VTS), showed mental retardation (Intelligence Test Score&#x200A;=&#x200A;70, normal range for 7-year-old Chinese children 80&#x223C;100) and mild delays in his motor milestones (Motor Performance Series Score &#x200A;=&#x200A;77, normal range for 7-year-old Chinese children 95&#x223C;115). Laboratory examinations could not detect abnormalities. Chromosome karyotype analysis was normal.</p>

The patient had a decreased ability to open his mouth that was attributed to a fibrous band of scar tissue in the cheeks and lips. Early tooth loss was noted, including almost all primary teeth except for a left mandibular primary second molar that was carious and mobile and some permanent teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066863-g002">Figure 2</xref>-A,B). Panoramic radiographs showed that 15 permanent teeth were missing, including lower central incisors and right premolars, all maxillary teeth except for second molars and the left canine. What was more, the existed teeth exhibited short root anomalies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066863-g002">Figure 2</xref>-C).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study we described the oral and dental manifestations of a Chinese child with CIPA and identified two missense mutations in the <italic>NTRK1</italic> gene. The patient has typical features, including insensitivity to pain, anhidrosis and mental retardation, confirming the diagnosis of CIPA. Histopathological examinations showed the absence of epidermal innervation, loss of most dermal innervation and hypoplastic dermal sweat glands without innervation. In addition, genetic examinations showed that the proband was in a state of compound heterozygosity, having two different mutations in the <italic>NTRK1</italic> gene on separate chromosomes. Although some degree of phenotypic variability was observed in the CIPA patients with proven <italic>NTRK1</italic> mutations, overall the clinical presentation corresponds to a readily recognizable syndrome that is genetically homogenous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-BarOn1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Rotthier1">[13]</xref>. In this case, the patient's parents and sisters were not affected as the carriers, indicating that the segregation of the mutations is consistent with a recessive disease. But this CIPA patient also exhibited some craniofacial manifestations which had never been documented in previous publications, such as nasal malformation, submucous cleft palate and developmental abnormalities of teeth. It is still uncertain whether the patient's disease was caused by single gene (<italic>NTRK1</italic>) disorder or multifactorial and polygenic (complex) disorders.</p>
      <p>NTRK1 protein (TRKA) is a tyrosine kinase receptor comprising an extracellular domain involved in NGF binding, a single transmembrane region, a juxtamembrane domain, a tyrosine kinase domain (TKD), which is important for signal transduction, and a C-terminal tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Indo1">[14]</xref>. Some studies identified TRKA tyrosine residues-470, 670, 674, 675 and 785 as autophosphorylation sites critical for activating intracellular signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Indo2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Kaplan3">[16]</xref>. The naturally occurring NTRK1 missense mutations close to crucial tyrosine residues G571R, R643W, R648C, D674Y, G708S and R774P, were detected in some CIPA patients, demonstrating that these conserved residues are important for TRKA activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Mardy1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Miranda1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Verpoorten1">[18]</xref>. In our studies, the 3D structural model analysis showed that F521L was located in the G-loop (also termed ATP phosphate-binding P loop), which could controls nucleotide affinity/specificity and g-phosphoryl transfer rate. R686H was located in the activation segment (amino acids 671&#x2013;696), which is a main regulatory domain. A mutation in this domain inactivates the kinase activity by blocking the ATP accessibility and preventing the protein substrate to bind correctly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Miranda1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Bertrand1">[19]</xref>. Our patient's phenotype suggests that the combination of two mutated residues could lead to a dramatic change in the biological function of TRKA.</p>
      <p>The most important characteristic of CIPA is the self-mutilating behavior that leads to facial and oral soft tissues lesions and premature tooth loss. Our patient exhibited some developmental defects, including congenital corneitis, submucous cleft palate, nasal defect and abnormal teeth, suggesting that the NTRK1 mutations may affect not only innervation but the development of oro-facial tissues as well. NGF/TRKA can promote the proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Wang1">[20]</xref>. It also plays a role in the regulation of preskeletal differentiation during craniofacial development in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Louryan1">[21]</xref>. Additionally, NGF/TRKA can promote cell proliferation and the cell cycle progression of corneal epithelial cells by activating cyclin D via the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Hong1">[22]</xref>. The NGF/TRKA pathway controls cranial neural crest cell fate specification and eventual differentiation into dental organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Amano1">[23]</xref>. So <italic>NTRK1</italic> might be extensively involved in multi-systemic development and could be associated with tissue patterning. Although previous studies showed NGF/TRKA pathway could play an important role in craniofacial development, it still needs further functional studies to explore the correlation with <italic>NTRK1</italic> mutations and craniofacial defects. Moreover, the patient's parents were consanguineous and some of this patient's craniofacial features, nasal malformation and cleft palate, were not presented in other published individuals with CIPA. Therefore, further studies of array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) should be performed to exclude recessive disorders and dysmorphisms caused by other genomic imbalance.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge, dental ultrastructure and micromorphology of CIPA patients have not been examined in previous reports. We first detected some dental abnormalities, including hypomineralization, thin teeth roots, dentin hypoplasia, cementogenesis defects and dysplastic periodontal ligament. Dental hypomineralization might increase the susceptibility to dental caries. We speculated further that dentin hypoplasia and hypomineralization could also contribute to dental attrition. Some studies showed that, as a potent promoter of mineralization during dentin formation, NGF significantly stimulates DNA synthesis and mineral deposition in cultures of human pulp cells, and induces differentiation of odontoblast-lineage cells with subsequent biomineralization in vitro<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Mizuno1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Arany1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Mitsiadis1">[26]</xref>. The features of shed teeth in CIPA patient suggest that NTRK1 could play an important role in root formation. Some studies have shown that TRKA is a convenient marker for identifying and characterizing Hertwig's root sheath and epithelial rests of Malasseze of the forming root <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Woodnutt1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Korkmaz1">[28]</xref>. Moreover, NGF/TRKA expressed in human periodontal tissue may contribute to the regeneration and the innervation of periodontal tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Kurihara1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0066863-Fujiyama1">[30]</xref>. These results highlight the importance of the NGF/TRKA pathway during tooth root development. The common oral sign of CIPA disease, premature loss of teeth, may not only have attributed to self-mutilating behavior but also to the developmental defects caused by NTRK1 mutation.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we identified two novel heterozygous missense mutations in a Chinese patient with CIPA. Systemic disorders and oral manifestations may be associated with these mutations in the NTRK1 gene. Further studies should be performed to explore the effects of these mutations on oral-craniofacial development.</p>

All individuals of the patient's family underwent evaluation of their full medical history evaluation and comprehensive physical examinations. The patient was thoroughly examined, including comprehensive neurophysiological assessment and oral examination. A pedigree of his family was created through clinical examinations and interviews with all available family members. The diagnosis was further verified by laboratory assays and genetic tests. Furthermore, 100 unrelated healthy individuals (including different ages, gender equality) were taken as control subjects to exclude the possibility of frequent polymorphisms.</p>
