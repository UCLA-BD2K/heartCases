      <abstract>
        <p>We describe the ocular alterations and the management after stings from Hymenopteran insects. In all the five patients, the insect was identified as bee. The patients presented with significant corneal edema, which resolved dramatically in three of them after removal of stingers. Among the other two one went for permanent corneal decompensation and the other developed Intumuscent cataract with increased intraocular pressure. Although a rare occurrence, ocular trauma caused by Hymenopteran insects has a potential to cause severe ocular damage in humans. A high level of clinical suspicion and immediate removal of the stingers along with administration of high doses of topical and systemic steroids is a must to prevent chances of permanent corneal damage and intraocular complications.</p>

    <p>The sting of members of the order Hymenoptera (e.g. bees, wasps, and biting ants) has long been known to cause local and regional reactions, systemic anaphylactic response, and less commonly delayed-type hypersensitivity. Only female hymenopteran insects have stingers, a modified ovipositor.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In the act of stinging, these insects introduce two bodily components into the eye,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] the stinger and the specific venom. The venom of hymenopteran insects contains biologic amines (histamine), polypeptide toxins (melittin), and enzymes (hyaluronidase).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p>

        <p>A 34-year-old male presented with history of fall of insect in the left eye (LE) of 2 days duration. LE examination showed an uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) of 20/200 with diffuse corneal stromal edema and Descemet's membrane folds along with a stinger protruding from the 7&#xB0; clock limbus [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>]. Anterior chamber (AC) reaction was present. The stinger was immediately removed at the slit lamp and topical antibiotic &#x2212; steroid eye drops and systemic steroids were started and tapered gradually over 6 weeks. The necrotic area scarred with a localized peripheral anterior synechia by the 4<sup>th</sup> week. The corneal edema completely cleared with UCVA improving to 20/20 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>].</p>

A dirty white necrotic area with three brown sharp needle-like foreign bodies lying in various levels of stroma was noted [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>]. The surrounding stroma was edematous. The three foreign bodies hard chitinous in nature were removed. He was treated with topical and systemic steroids in tapering doses.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In all the five cases, the insect was identified as bee based on the patient's history. Bees use the stinger only as a defensive weapon to inject venom into the tissues of the victim and leave the stinger in the process.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] If the venom gland is still adherent acutely, attached muscle fibers will continue to contract, resulting in additional venom discharge and more toxicity (case 1 = 2 days; case 2 = 10 days). Even though the time interval between exposure and removal of the stingers is crucial, we also believe that a favorable outcome depends on the type of species[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] of bee responsible for the trauma (case 3 = few hours) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="IJO-62-248-g009"/>
      </table-wrap>
      <p>In relation to the several species of bees, it was observed that differences exist between the compositions of venom components, with variations in the levels of enzymes present, suggesting that this can result in different degrees of immunogenic potential and/or toxicity. Bee venoms share both neurotoxic and hemolytic properties.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The main toxin in bee venom is melittin,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] a basic compound with strong surface activity. The chemotaxis of polymorphnuclear leukocytes result in a white corneal infiltrate[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] with surrounding intense stromal edema. This infiltrate mimics a microbial keratitis and in cases associated with severe uveitis it may be misdiagnosed as viral keratouveitis.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Unless a high degree of suspicion is maintained, these cases will be treated with antifungals or antibiotics or antivirals and thus deprived of the need to remove the stinger[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and administer high doses of steroids. The severe eye pain after bee sting is caused by the sudden release of highly concentrated biogenic amines,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] such as histamine, in the venom. Posterior segment complications[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] like retrobulbar neuritis, papilledema, and optic atrophy have also been reported.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Although rare, insect stings can result in severe impairment of vision in humans. The retained insect parts are usually very tiny with surrounding inflammatory reactions and necrosis so that they can be easily missed and may mimic microbial keratitis even under slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Since the treatment modalities are entirely different and the earlier the diagnosis, the better the chance of visual prognosis, a high level of clinical suspicion and immediate removal of the stingers along with administration of high doses of topical and systemic steroids will reduce the chances of permanent corneal damage and intraocular complications.</p>
