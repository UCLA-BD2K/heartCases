        <p>A 7-month-old castrated male
French Bull dog was presented with vomiting, lethargy, anorexia and weight loss of 2 weeks
duration. The patient&#x2019;s history and clinical manifestations of suspected hepatopathy were
subjected to ultrasonography, radiography, biochemical investigations and cytology of
hepatic lesion. The cytologic impression was hepatic lymphoma, which was later confirmed
by histopathology. The neoplastic cells were strongly diffusely immunoreactive for PAX5,
but not immunoreactive for CD3, and B lymphocyte specific clonal proliferation was
detected using by assay of antigen receptor rearrangement. Large numbers of immunoreactive
mature non-neoplastic lymphocytes were admixed with the neoplastic cell population.
Therefore, the immunohistochemical results were definitively consistent with a T-cell rich
B-cell lymphoma (TCRBCL). This is the first description of a hepatic TCRBCL in a juvenile
dog showing a poor response to aggressive chemotherapy.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Lymphoma is a malignant disorder derived from clonal proliferation of lymphoid precursor
cells and is one of the most commonly diagnosed canine neoplasms [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Tumor cell type is an important
criterion for treatment and prognosis, and lymphoma has been broadly divided into two major
groups of B-cell tumors and T-cell tumors based on the immunophenotype of the neoplastic cells
[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma is
characterized by infiltration of the liver, spleen and bone marrow with neoplastic
lymphocytes, absence of peripheral lymphadenopathy and an aggressive clinical course, but no
case reports have described hepatic T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma (TCRBCL) in veterinary
practice [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, canine
lymphoma is diagnosed predominantly in middle-aged dogs with a median of 5&#x2013;9 years [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. No reports have described hepatic
T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma in a juvenile dog. This report details the case of a 6-month-old
French Bull dog as the first juvenile case of hepatic T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma.</p>
    <p>A 7-month-old castrated male French Bull dog presented with vomiting, lethargy, anorexia and
weight loss of 2 weeks duration. A complete blood count was within normal physiological
reference ranges, except for mild anemia without polychromasia in the blood smear (red blood
cells, 4.95 &#xD7; 10<sup>6</sup>/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>; reference range, 5.50&#x2013;8.50 &#xD7;
10<sup>6</sup>/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>). Serum biochemistry revealed mildly decreased
electrolytes and increased liver enzyme activity, which were consistent with hepatic
insufficiency. Survey radiography identified severe hepatomegaly, blunted liver margin and
serosal detail loss. On ultrasonographic examination, hepatic echogenicity was homogenously
increased compared with splenic and renal echogenicities, and there were no findings of focal
abnormalities. However, it was difficult to make comparison with echogenicity between spleen
and liver, and spleen was enlarged and hypoechoic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1a
and 1b</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>On abdominal radiograph, there is extremely hepatomegaly with blunt margination and
caudal deviation of gastric axis. There is poor detail in the peritoneal space, and the
animal is in thin body condition (a). Uniformly increased hepatic parenchymal
echogenicity, reduced visualization of portal structures and small amount of ascites are
described. There is extension of the liver ventral to the stomach, and liver is slightly
higher echo intensity than the spleen (b).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1393-g001"/></fig>). Liver was ultrasound-guided aspirated, smeared and stained with Wright-Giemsa stain
for cytological interpretation.</p>
    <p>The cytological specimens contained moderately cellular smears consisting of a moderately
increased number of immature lymphocytes and a low number of small lymphocytes (70% and 30%,
respectively) and clusters of hepatocytes with increased cytoplasmic basophilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Cytology of the liver hypoechoic lesion. Small clusters of hepatocytes with increased
cytoplasmic basophilia, increased number of medium to large lymphocytes and a few
disrupted cells were noted along with cellular debris and numerous cytoplasmic
fragments. Wright&#x2013;Giemsa, &#xD7;400.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1393-g002"/></fig>). More than half the cells were disrupted and scattered in the background with a large
amount of cellular debris. Immature lymphocytes were medium to large with scant to mild
amounts of deeply basophilic cytoplasm and occasional small vacuoles. Nuclei were round to
indented to irregularly contoured with coarsely clumped chromatin and no prominent nucleoli.
Numerous variably sized basophilic cytoplasmic fragments were also noted in the background.
The cytological impression was lymphoma, possibly of liver origin, which was also highly
suspected in conjunction with the patient&#x2019;s history, clinical manifestations of suspected
hepatopathy and ultrasonography findings.</p>
    <p>A surgical biopsy for histology and immunophenotyping was recommended for a definitive
diagnosis. After conducting the liver biopsy, the tissues were fixed in 10% buffered-formalin
and sent to IDEXX Laboratories (Westbrook, ME, U.S.A.) for histology and immunohistochemistry.
The paraffin samples were sectioned at 5 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>m and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin for clinical histology. The avidin-biotin complex (ABC) method was applied for
immunohistochemistry. Antigen retrieval was performed by placing the slides in a bath of 10 mM
citric acid (pH 6) and boiling for 16 min in an autoclave. Mouse anti-canine CD3 (clone
CA17.2A12, Serotec, Oxford, U.K.) and mouse anti-human PAX5 (clone BC/24, Biocare Medical,
Walnut Creek, CA, U.S.A.) primary antibodies were used. Histologically, there were sheets of
neoplastic round cells markedly expanding in the portal regions that formed numerous clusters
within the adjacent hepatic parenchyma. The neoplastic cells were large (25&#x2013;30
<italic>&#xB5;</italic>m in diameter) with a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm and
indistinct cell borders. The nuclei were extremely large with finely stippled to vesicular
chromatin and occasionally contained 1&#x2013;2 prominent nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Histologic section of surgical biopsy specimen from the liver in a dog. Note the
cluster of large neoplastic cells within the adjacent hepatic parenchyma. Small numbers
of mature lymphocytes were multifocally admixed with the neoplastic cell population.
H&amp;E.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1393-g003"/></fig>). Marked anisocytosis and anisokaryosis existed. Occasional multinucleate cells were
found, and small numbers of mature lymphocytes were multifocally admixed with the neoplastic
cell population. Rare pigment-laden macrophages were present, and intervening hepatocytes were
diffusely and markedly swollen with abundant indistinct clear cytoplasmic vacuoles. Marked
hepatocellular pleomorphism was also detected.</p>
    <p>PAX5 and CD79 are both B cell markers. PAX5 is a &#x201C;cleaner&#x201D; IHC with less non-specific
staining and is preferred by most anatomic pathologists [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Most B cell lymphomas are
immunoreactive for both; although a small proportion is positive for PAX5 and not CD79 and
vice versa. So, if there is a lymphoma that is negative for CD3 (not T cell) and negative for
PAX5, veterinary pathologists would run a CD79 before calling it a &#x201C;null cell&#x201D;. We used a dual
stain (CD3/PAX5 on the same slide), and our specific protocol is briefly described as follow.
Dilution ratio was 1:300 using Renoir Red diluent (Biocare Medical, Walnut Creek, CA, U.S.A.).
Incubation time was 60 min, and antigen retrieval method using citraconic anhydride was
performed. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) detection system (Biocare Medical #MC541) was used and
followed by 30 min incubation and chromogen DAB (DAB enhancer [5 min]; GBI Labs # C07-25)
application. Control sections were prepared using canine or feline lymph node. The neoplastic
cells were strongly diffusely immunoreactive to PAX5, but not to CD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_004" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Immunohistochemical section of the liver biopsy. Neoplastic cells are diffusely
immunoreactive for PAX5 (brown). Large numbers of non-neoplastic mature lymphocytes are
immunoreactive for CD3 (red).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1393-g004"/></fig>). Large numbers of immunoreactive mature non-neoplastic lymphocytes were admixed with
the neoplastic cell population. The immunohistochemistry results were definitively consistent
with TCRBCL.</p>
    <p>In addition, PCR to detect antigen receptor rearrangements with primers for conserved regions
of the V and J genes was performed. Briefly, the DNA extraction from archival cytological
slides was performed using a commercially available kit (QIAamp DNA mini kit, Qiagen, GmbH,
Germany) and amplification of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gamma sequences was performed
using previously described primers [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].
Approximately 50&#x2013;100 <italic>n</italic>g of DNA was amplified with 500 <italic>n</italic>m of
each primer in a 20 <italic>&#xB5;l</italic> reaction volume using 1&#xD7; DNA Hot Start PCR Premix
(LeGene biosciences, San Diego, CA, U.S.A.). PCR products were separated on 12% polyacrylamide
gel (1.5 mm thick) by electrophoresis using 1&#xD7; Tris borate EDTA buffer at 100V for 90 min.
Result for PCR to detect antigen receptor rearrangements presented the pattern that IgH major
primers which are specific for the majority of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements were
strongly amplified, whereas the IgH minor primers which are specific for a smaller proportion
of immunoglobulin rearrangements were weakly amplified suggesting B-cell malignancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_005">Fig. 5</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_005" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>Result of PCR to detect antigen receptor rearrangements from this case.

minor (lane h) and TCR&#x3B3; (lane T). Lane M refers a DNA size marker.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1393-g005"/></fig>).</p>
    <p>Subsequent to the fine needle aspiration and biopsy results, bone marrow examination was
further intended for the staging of the lymphoma, but was denied by the owner due to
economical constraint and demand for a therapy. Originally, no abnormal cells were identified
in the peripheral blood smears. A standard 6 month CHOP chemotherapy protocol (modified
Wisconsin) for treatment of lymphoma [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] was
constituted. Briefly, the treatment was composed of vincristine (0.7 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, IV), L-
asparaginase (400 U/kg, SC) and prednisone (2 mg/kg, PO, SID) for 7 days in the first week,
cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, PO) and prednisone (1.5 mg/kg, PO, SID) for 7 days in
the second week, vincristine (0.7 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, IV) and prednisone (1 mg/kg, PO, SID) for
7 days in the third week and doxorubicin (30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, IV) and prednisone (0.5 mg/kg,
PO, SID) for 7 days in the fourth week. However, despite the continued chemotherapy, even a
partial remission was not achieved until after treatment with doxorubicin hydrochloride during
week 4. On day 16 after initiation of chemotherapy, the patient was referred for respiratory
distress. On an ultrasound examination, focal multiple round nodules were shown in liver
parenchyma and renal cortex, unlike at two months ago. Focal lesions are seen in ultrasound
images of the liver as small round nodules with a hypoechoic rim and a hyperechoic or
isoechoic center. In addition, on post-contrast CT examination, hypodense multiple nodules
were seen in bilateral renal cortex, which was suspected as infiltrative. There were no
remarkable findings in cardiovascular and respiratory systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_006">Fig. 6</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_006" position="float"><label>Fig. 6.</label><caption><p>Post-contrast CT image shows that multiple round hypodense nodules located generally in
liver parenchymal and renal cortex.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1393-g006"/></fig>). Complete blood count (CBC) parameters were in normal, but the serumbiochemistry
results showed significantly elevated BUN, creatinin, ALT and AST values than the reference
range, indicating the liver and renal dysfunction. During the hospitalization, the patient was
given fluid therapy using 0.459% NaCl against dehydration and liver supporting medication
including UDCA (30 mg/kg/day). The patient&#x2019;s condition continued to rapidly deteriorate
clinically on day 23 of the chemotherapy protocol. The dog became more lethargic and developed
hemoptysis and breathing difficulties on day 28 of chemotherapy and died. The autopsy was not
performed, since the owner was unacceptable to do it.</p>
    <p>TCRBCL is a histologic variant of the diffuse B-cell lymphoma group, which has been reported
only in the other animal species than dogs with middle aged individuals. Multicentric TCRBCL
with a mixed cell population of large to small round cells has been reported in a pig, and the
neoplastic tissue findings were similar to those of human TCRBCL [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. TCRBCL has been described in an
older cat with the same morphologic preferences as human TCRBCL [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Only one study has reported orbital TCRBCL in an 11-year-old Shetland sheepdog
[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, there are no reports
involving very young dogs (7 months old) with lymphoma primarily affecting the liver and no
response to chemotherapy. The case presented here suggests that juvenile dogs can also develop
TCRBCL.</p>
    <p>In the present case, initial biopsies of the hepatic mass had characteristics consistent with
descriptions of TCRBCL in both the human and veterinary literatures. The histologic analysis
of the affected tissues revealed a diffuse predominant population of small nonneoplastic
lymphoid cells with fewer large neoplastic lymphoid cells. These large neoplastic cells were
morphologically suggestive of immunoblastic B lymphocytes. They were CD3 negative, and the
scattered cells (5%) were PAX5 positive on immunostaining. All of the neoplastic cells had
similar morphology as that of human TCRBCL. The majority of the background population was
composed of CD3-positive small T lymphocytes. Occasional large round to oval neoplastic cells
were present in the background. Mitotic figures were seen in the population of large cells
only. These large cells were PAX5 positive on immunostaining. Nearly all of the small lymphoid
cells were CD3 positive with only a few scattered small background lymphocytes being PAX5
positive. These findings suggest that lymphomagenesis in this case was contributed by PAX5
overexpression, which significantly reduced p53 gene expression, which is normally regulated
by PAX5. PAX5 (B-cell-specific activator protein, BSAP) is a member of the paired box domain
gene family that encodes nuclear transcription factors important in development,
differentiation, cell migration and proliferation [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. PAX5 protein is expressed as a
nuclear marker in B-lineage cells that span the differentiation spectrum from precursor B
cells to early plasma cells [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
    <p>A rapid response to chemotherapy is consistent with the reported chemoresponsive nature of
TCRBCL in humans [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and of lymphoma in dogs
[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Case reports in humans have
documented remission following early aggressive chemotherapy. Data regarding the biologic
behavior, clinical response and outcome of TCRBCL in veterinary medicine are still limited.
However, hepatic TCRBCL in a juvenile dog with no response to aggressive chemotherapy has not
been reported previously in dogs. Previous reports indicate that lymphoma is slowly
progressive and typically affects older animals. However, our case suggests that a positive
prognosis should not be expected in hepatic TCRBCL despite aggressive chemotherapy (CHOP
protocol), if the patient is too young at the age of onset. In addition, more population
studies on juvenile TCRBCL cases need to analyze the molecular pathogenesis of juvenile
TCRBCL.</p>
    <p>Early recognition and diagnosis are important for clinical management and good outcomes.
Although extremely rare, hepatic TCRBCL should be included in differential diagnoses even when
young dogs present with acute hepatopathy. The prognosis of TCRBCL is dependent on starting
aggressive chemotherapy immediately. In general, older individuals report a good prognosis
with the CHOP chemotherapy protocol in the veterinary literature. However, the present case
was hepatic TCRBCL in a juvenile dog with a poor prognosis. This is the first description of
hepatic TCRBCL in a juvenile dog. We hope more case reports and reviews of hepatic TCRBCL in
juvenile dogs will provide oncologic information for veterinary clinical practitioners and
oncologists and will be useful in further research and clinical trials.</p>
