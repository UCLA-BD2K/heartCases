      <abstract>
        <p>Primary breast chondrosarcoma has been rarely reported in the literature. Conservative breast surgery has never been part of the management of previously reported cases. Surgery remains the mainstay management of such a disease as it is resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In this report, we present a case of rare primary myxoid chondrosarcoma of the breast that was managed successfully with a conservative approach.</p>

    <p>Non-epithelial breast malignancies are rare, accounting for less than 1% of all breast tumours.<sup><xref rid="CIT1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Breast sarcomas have hardly been reported in the literature (less than 0.1% of all malignant breast tumours).<sup><xref rid="CIT1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT2" ref-type="bibr"/>2</sup> Primary chondrosarcomas of the breast are the most rare among this group.<xref rid="CIT2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
    <p>There is no standard clinical presentation. However, all the described cases have been reported in patients over 50 years of age, with a rapid rate of growth and reaching a relatively large size. In spite of locally aggressive behaviour, none of the reported cases showed any signs of skin infiltration or nodal involvement.</p>
    <p>There is still only limited knowledge on the best surgical approach in the management of such cases. The role of neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy has yet to be defined.<sup><xref rid="CIT1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="CIT3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>

      <title>Case history</title>
      <p>A 35-year-old woman presented to the surgical outpatient clinic of the National Cancer Institute at Cairo University with a rapidly growing right breast mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>). She had no significant past medical history and no family history for cancer. Clinical examination showed a palpable, relatively mobile, painless breast mass situated between the upper quadrants with no overlying skin involvement. The mass was hard in consistency, nearly measuring 10cm &#xD7; 10cm with a well defined irregular outline. Examination of the axilla and contralateral breast was unremarkable. Ultrasonography showed a large well defined heterogeneous hypoechoic lobulated mass measuring about 10cm &#xD7; 8.8cm in diameter with no ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy. Imaging of the contralateral breast and axilla was insignificant. Triple assessment was completed by performing a core tissue biopsy that showed a myoepithelial lesion. Complete excision was therefore recommended in our multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting.
<fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Preoperative photograph showing right breast mass and incision lines for planned conservative breast approach</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="003588414x13824511649210-1"/></fig></p>
      <p>Our provisional diagnosis following discussion in the MDT meeting was phyllodes tumour of the breast, and a plan for complete excision and reconstruction was established. Incision was planned preoperatively with an inferior-based breast reduction plan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>). Complete excision of the mass was carried out with negative safety margins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>) confirmed by intraoperative frozen section. Local glandular flaps were used to reconstruct the remaining breast volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>) without major discrepancy in breast symmetry. The postoperative course was uneventful.

There was no need for contralateral reduction mammoplasty. (No major discrepancy in breast symmetry.)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="003588414x13824511649210-3"/></fig></p>
      <p>Gross and microscopic pictures of the excised mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs 4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) were consistent with the picture of rare extraskeletal chondrosarcoma, myxoid type. The patient has not received any adjuvant therapy. She is currently under close follow-up and has remained disease free for the last 15 months.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Primary breast sarcoma is a rare entity accounting for less than 1% of all malignant breast tumours.<sup><xref rid="CIT1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Up until 2011, only seven cases of chondrosarcoma of the breast had been reported in the literature.<xref rid="CIT1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> All reported cases presented similarly with a rapid rate of growth, reaching a relatively large mass in the breast within a short period of time. Such a rapid onset has never been reported as being associated with skin involvement, regional lymphadenopathy or even any systemic disease.<xref rid="CIT4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p>
      <p>It is obvious that all of the reported cases had an age preference towards those above 50 years.<xref rid="CIT1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The clinical presentation of primary breast chondrosarcomas is very similar to that of phyllodes tumours and metaplastic carcinomas. Histological examination remains an essential tool in differentiating between the three diseases. The absence of any epithelial component, and presence of chondroid areas with cellular atypia and pleomorphism in the breast specimen itself is the key factor in diagnosing such a disease.<xref rid="CIT5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p>
      <p>All the reported cases were treated with a radical surgical approach that entailed removal of all breast tissue. The role of axillary evacuation remains uncertain as all these cases had axillary dissection, nodal sampling or even sentinels node biopsy, which proved to be negative for malignancy.<xref rid="CIT6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> We therefore felt that axillary evacuation could be avoided with a more conservative approach.</p>
      <p>The role of adjuvant therapy is very limited as chondrosarcomas are well known for being resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Surgical resection remains the only curative treatment option<sup><xref rid="CIT1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="CIT3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and adjuvant therapy was therefore not a valid option. The patient agreed with our decision and has remained disease free for 15 months.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Surgical resection of primary breast chondrosarcoma remains the only curative option. However, the extent of such resection remains uncertain. Conservative breast surgery in these rare tumours could be a successful approach, especially when no axillary evacuation or adjuvant therapy is required.</p>
