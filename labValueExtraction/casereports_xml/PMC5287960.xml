          <p>It is extremely rare, but sometimes, RCH can be life-threatening. It is necessary to check the patient's general condition, underlying diseases and medical history.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Most postoperative intracranial hemorrhages occur around the operative site. Remote cerebellar hemorrhage (RCH) after supratentorial craniotomy is rare, usually benign but occasionally may cause serious morbidity or mortality.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup></p>
      <p>Although the exact pathophysiology of RCH remains incompletely understood, there is growing consensus that the loss of a large amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may be involved.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> We report bilateral malignant RCH after surgical clipping of a middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation unruptured aneurysm in a patient with previous cerebellar infarction and present a brief review of the literature.</p>

      <title>Case report</title>
      <p>A-62-year-old male had an 4&#x200A;mm unruptured left MCA bifurcation saccular aneurysm incidentally identified during work-up for a headache (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). He had a history of hypertension and had experienced focal left cerebellar infarction 2 years earlier. After being taken off his antiplatelet agent for 7 days, coagulation profiles of the patient were normalized. Then, a left pterional craniotomy was performed and the aneurysm was clipped uneventfully according to intraoperative neuromonitoring. The dura was closed, and the bone flap was plated. After a flat 400cc Jackson-Pratt drain was placed, the mucles and scalp were sutured anatomically. The patient's blood pressure was maintained within normal range during surgery and perioperative period. A routine immediate postoperative head computed tomography (CT) showed no abnormal findings except air density on the left frontotemporal area due to perioperative CSF drainage and the patient's neurological status was unchanged from the preoperative level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). However, he developed increased sleepiness followed by agitation and confusion on the first postoperative day. Follow-up head CT scan performed 20&#x200A;hours after surgery revealed bilateral RCH with a &#x201C;zebra sign&#x201D; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C and D). After 5&#x200A;hours, the patient lapsed into a coma. CT scan showed additional hemorrhage with effacement of the basal cistern and a mass effect on the brain stem. Emergency posterior fossa decompression and external ventricular drainage were performed but he died 14 days later.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>RCH after neurosurgical intervention is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication. The reported incidence of RCH is around 0.08 to 0.6% of all supratentorial surgeries and 2.8% after craniotomies to clip unruptured intracranial aneurysms.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup></p>
      <p>Usually, most cases of RCH are asymptomatic and are detected on postoperative imaging. In symptomatic cases, the most common presentation of RCH is a decreased level of consciousness resulting from hydrocephalus or brainstem compression. Other common symptoms are cerebellar dysfunction, headache, motor deficits, and delayed awakening from anesthesia.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Although the exact pathophygiology of RCH has not been established, it is largely accepted that it has a venous origin and is likely the result of massive CSF loss during the intraoperative and/or postoperative period.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> With significant CSF loss, the cerebellum may sag and stretch cerebellar bridging veins into the tentorium, torcular, and transverse sinus. These stretched veins result in transient occlusion and consequent increased venous pressure.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> The characteristic appearance of RCH on imaging, known as a zebra sign (curvilinear collections of blood paralleling the superior folia and fissure toward the tentorium), supports this theory. Moreover, the role of CSF loss is further supported by the fact that RCH tends to be more common following surgery for unruptured aneurysms compared with ruptured aneurysm.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Generally, in the presence of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage, there is effacement of the CSF space so free CSF egress is restricted in the subarachnoid space. Besides this popular theory, various mechanisms have been suggested to contribute to RCH such as arterial hypertension, arterial capillary trauma, occult arteriovenous malformation bleeding, extreme head rotation and flexion, old parenchymal injury, coagulopathy, and drugs.</p>
      <p>We have presented a patient with malignant RCH after surgery for an unruptured aneurysm, who eventually died from brainstem compression. On a retrospective review of this patient, there were several points contributing to the occurrence of fulminant RCH&#x2014;first, as is well known, loss of a large volume of CSF. We had opened the basal cistern for proximal control during the early stage of the operation, so CSF loss from the basal and sylvian cistern was sustained until dura closure. Second, the patient had a history of stroke and the left cerebellum showed encephalomalacia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). This injury may cause damaged auto-regulation, leading to the increased blood flow and hemorrhage.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Third, although the patient stopped taking antiplatelet agents 7 days before surgery, he had been taking aspirin for 2 years. In general, aspirin and other anti-platelet agents have been implicated as risk factors for postoperative hemorrhage. Moreover, previous studies reported that angiplatete agents or ancoagulants have been implicated as risk factors for RCH.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Fourth, we think that there may have been an unexpected mistake in the later stage of surgery. We placed one 400cc Jackson&#x2013;Pratt drain string just above the temporal bone-work side, which had been grinded to ensure operation visibility (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). This might have introduced additional negative pressure in the supratentorial space and upward traction of the tentorium. In addition to downward sagging of the cerebellum due to excessive CSF drainage, upward traction of the tentorium might aggravate the stretching of cerebellar bridging veins, such as the superior vermian vein, into the tentorium.</p>

      <p>It is extremely rare, but sometimes, RCH can be life-threatening. Therefore, it is essential to be aware of this rare condition. Before surgery, it is necessary to check the patient's general condition, underlying diseases, and medical history. During surgery, controlled drainage of the CSF seems to be most important. Arachnoidplasty before dura closure may be a consideration and the position of the drain string might have to be carefully determined.</p>
