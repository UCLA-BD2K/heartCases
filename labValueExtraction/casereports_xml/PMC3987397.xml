          <p>Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) was established as an important
alternative for high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. However, there are
few data in the literature regarding coronary obstruction, that although rare, is
a potentially fatal complication. </p>

          <title>Objective</title>
          <p>Evaluate this complication in Brazil.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>We evaluated all patients presenting coronary obstruction from the Brazilian
Registry of TAVI. Main baseline and procedural characteristics, management of the

        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>From 418 consecutive TAVI procedures, coronary obstruction occurred in 3 cases
(incidence of 0.72%). All patients were women, without prior coronary artery
bypass grafting (CABG), and with mean age of 85 &#xB1; 3 years, logistic EuroSCORE of
15 &#xB1; 6% and STS-PROM score of 9 &#xB1; 4%. All of the cases were performed with
balloon-expandable Sapien XT prosthesis. In one patient, with pre-procedural
computed tomography data, coronary arteries presented a low height and a narrow
sinus of Valsalva. All patients presented with clinically significant severe
maintained hypotension, immediately after valve implantation, and even though
coronary angioplasty with stent implantation was successfully performed in all
cases, patients died during hospitalization, being two periprocedurally.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Coronary obstruction following TAVI is a rare but potentially fatal complication,
being more frequent in women and with the balloon-expandable prosthesis.
Anatomical factors might be related with its increased occurrence, highlighting
the importance of a good pre-procedural evaluation of the patients in order to
avoid this severe complication.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become an important alternative for
the treatment of high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis and those considered
inoperable<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Regardless of the
constant device improvements and growing experience of centers performing the procedure,
several complications may occur. Among them, there is coronary obstruction, that
although rare, is potentially fatal. Despite case reports and the variable incidence
among large registries and randomized studies (0.35-4.0%)<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, there is little information about predictors, clinical
presentation and treatment. Thus, we report a series of cases of this complication based
on data obtained from the Brazilian Registry of TAVI.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="methods">
      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>We evaluated all cases of coronary obstruction after TAVI for the treatment of severe
and symptomatic aortic stenosis in high-risk patients, included in the Brazilian
Registry of TAVI. Main baseline and procedural characteristics, management of the
complication, and clinical outcomes were collected from all patients. Coronary
obstruction was defined as an important decrease in coronary flow documented by
selective angiography or aortography.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>From January 2008 and January 2013, 418 patients were included in the Brazilian Registry
of TAVI at 18 centers, of which 405 (96.9%) showed aortic valve stenosis and 13 (3.1%)
dysfunction of surgical bioprosthesis. There were 3 cases (0.72%) of coronary
obstruction after TAVI, all in native valves. </p>
      <sec>
        <title>Case 1</title>
        <p>A 83-year-old female, hypertensive, diabetic, with coronary artery disease and heart
failure functional class III (NYHA). In clinical evaluation, it was noted severe
aortic stenosis (mean gradient: 77 mmHg; valve area: 0.50 cm<sup>2</sup>) of high
risk (logistic EuroSCORE: 9.5%; STS PROM: 7.9%) being referred to TAVI. On
angiotomography it was verified the sinus of Valsalva with mean diameter of 26 mm,
valve annulus of 24 mm and height of right coronary artery (RCA) and left main (LM)
of 10.4 mm and 9.6 mm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>).
The procedure was performed by transfemoral approach, with implantation of a 26 mm
balloon-expandable Sapien XT prosthesis. Immediately after valve implantation, the
patient evolved with severe and maintained hypotension, in addition to ST-segment
elevation detected on cardiac monitoring. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed
appropriate bioprosthesis positioning, with mild perivalvular regurgitation. On
aortography it was detected complete obstruction of RCA ostium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). A condition of shock and cardiac arrest had quickly
begun, so that cardiopulmonary resuscitation and angioplasty with implantation of 2
drug-eluting stent of the RCA were successfully performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). As a further complication, due to resuscitation
procedures, there was a perforation on right ventricle by temporary pacemaker and
tamponade, and despite the treatment of the complications, there was another cardiac
arrest and subsequent death.</p>

        <title>Case 2</title>
        <p>A 82-year-old female, hypertensive and diabetic, in clinical evaluation due to
functional class II (NYHA) heart failure, was diagnosed with significant aortic
stenosis (mean gradient: 68 mmHg; valve area: 0.60 cm<sup>2</sup>). Based on her age
and high risk (logistic EuroSCORE: 13.3%; STS-PROM: 14.8%), the patient was referred
to transfemoral TAVI, with implantation of a 23 mm Sapien XT prosthesis. Immediately
after valve implantation, the patient developed severe and maintained hypotension,
without electrocardiographic changes. Control aortography showed complete obstruction
of LM ostium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>). Drug-eluting stent
implantation in the LM was performed with restoration of coronary flow and immediate
reversal of shock condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>). After
the procedure, however, a severe stroke was detected, with development of pneumonia
and death after 78 days of hospitalization.</p>

        <title>Case 3</title>
        <p>A 89-year-old female, with history of hypertension, dyslipidemia and ischemic
cardiomyopathy with previous percutaneous coronary intervention, was developing heart
failure functional class III (NYHA), being diagnosed with significant aortic stenosis
(mean gradient: 83 mmHg; valve area: 0.60 cm<sup>2</sup>). Based on her age and high
risk (logistic EuroSCORE: 23.2%; STS-PROM: 5.4%), the patient was referred to TAVI,
that was performed by the transfemoral approach, with implantation of a 23 mm Sapien
XT. Due to the presence of moderate periprosthetic aortic regurgitation,
post-dilation was carried out. Control aortography and TEE revealed a decrease in
aortic regurgiration and the absence of other complications. However, 50 minutes
after procedure, the patient suddenly developed severe and maintained hypotension,
and aortography showed obstruction of the LM ostium. Despite successful implantation
of a bare-metal stent, the patient persisted in refractory cardiogenic shock, leading
to death.</p>

    <sec sec-type="discussion">
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>These cases show that coronary obstruction, although rare, is a severe complication in
patients undergoing TAVI. Since the beginning of TAVI procedures, still in the first
experimental procedures, coronary obstruction has always been a concern, due to the
implantation of biological valve surrounded by a stent frame and due to the proximity of
the coronary arteries with the aortic valve. In fact, coronary obstruction was reported
in the first experimental studies with percutaneous aortic bioprosthesis<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, being further described in humans in
2006<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Despite these initial
concerns and variable frequencies in the literature, currently, in the major registries
and studies worldwide, its incidence is &lt; 1%<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. In the Brazilian Registry of TAVI, coronary obstruction incidence
was very similar, of 0.72%.</p>
      <p>With respect to associated mechanisms, we can observe that, after implantation of
bioprosthesis, in all three cases there was a displacement of calcified valve cusp
towards coronary ostium, a mechanism also verified in most cases in the
literature<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Moreover, no case
occurred through the endoprosthesis stent frame, nor through its leaflet<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Despite the fact that the
self-expandable CoreValve prosthesis present increased dimensions of its stent, all
cases were documented with balloon-expandable Sapien XT prosthesis. The highest
frequency with the latter was also suggested in the literature, however, the exact
mechanisms for its occurrence are not defined<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Factors such as the
different material used in prostheses, their implantation mechanisms, as well as
recommended criteria for implantation, may have some influence<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Although the mechanism is apparently common among coronary obstruction cases, risk
factors for their occurrence are very controversial in the literature. However, there is
evidence that the low origin of coronary arteries and sinus of Valsalva with reduced
dimensions, may be predictors of its occurrence<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Regarding the latter anatomical risk factor, it is believed that
the smaller space in coronary sinus to accommodate the thick and calcified valve
leaflet, may cause its protrusion and, consequently, occlusion of coronary ostia. In the
literature, the mean height of the coronary origin in patients with coronary occlusion
after TAVI<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, is lower than control
patients (mean of 10.3 mm for LM vs. 13-15 mm for control group; p &lt; 0.01)<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.
This fact can also be observed in aortic sinus (mean of 28 mm vs. 32-36 mm from other
studies in the literature; p &lt; 0,01)<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Previous studies on anatomy and computed tomography have shown that women have coronary
height and aortic sinus with reduced dimensions compared to men, and on average, LM
shows reduced height in relation to RCA<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. These studies could partly explain the higher frequency of this
complication in women (83% versus ~50% in registries; p &lt; 0.001)<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, as in our study, and preferential
involvement of LM.</p>
      <p>Although coronary angioplasty can be performed with high rate of success, the increased
mortality of patients highlights the importance of a proper evaluation and
pre-procedural planning. After identifying the risk factors above described,
measurements such as less aggressive dimensioning of the bioprosthesis and the selection
of a self expandable prosthesis instead of balloon expandable, could prevent the
occurrence of this severe complication. Additionally, other preventive measures such as
the a coronary guidewire protection, could speed up the treatment of a possible coronary
obstruction. Future studies including a larger number of cases may confirm the
predictors as well as a more proper management of this significant TAVI
complication.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, coronary obstruction following TAVI is a rare but potentially fatal
complication, being more frequent in women. Low lying coronary ostia and small sinus of
Valsalva may be anatomical risk factors, emphasizing the importance of a proper
pre-procedural evaluation in order to avoid this complication.</p>
