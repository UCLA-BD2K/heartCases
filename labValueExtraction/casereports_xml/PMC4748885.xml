      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>The patient, a male former smoker (40 package-years) born in 1932, presented a past medical history of peptic ulcer, hypertension, and thoracic aortic aneurysm. After the first diagnosis of transitional cell bladder cancer (pT1 G1) in January 2007, the patient was treated with TURB plus intravescical mytomicin C. The subsequent follow-up was inconsistent due to poor patient compliance. In November 2012, the patient reported macrohematuria, followed by acute urinary retention and bladder catheterization the following month. A whole-body CT scan with and without contrast showed the presence of an intravescical tumor mass and widespread bilateral lymph node metastases in the obturator fossae and along the iliac vases (short axis, 2.3&#x200A;cm max). In February 2013, the patient underwent cystectomy plus iliac and obturator lymphadenectomy. Histology examination of the surgical specimen showed a high-grade urothelial carcinoma infiltrating the perivescical fat, with extensive lymphnode involvement (pT3 N2). In April 2013, whole-body CT scan with and without contrast showed bilateral persistent pelvic and retroperitoneal lymph node metastases in the obturator fossa (1.5&#x200A;cm), along the right iliac vases (right, 3.3&#x200A;cm max) and in the interaortocaval space (1.5&#x200A;cm max). First-line treatment for metastatic disease consisted of 5 cycles of cisplatin plus gemcitabine, which were administered since April, 2013, until August, 2013. After the 5th cycle, the patient suffered from kidney damage, so he received carboplatin plus gemcitabine in September, 2013. In October 2013, CT scan showed persistence of enlarged lymphnodes in the obturator fossa (2&#x200A;cm max), so the patient received paclitaxel-based salvage chemotherapy. Paclitaxel was preferred over vinflunine, because the patient had been suffering from severe constipation for the past 2 weeks at the time of initiation of second-line paclitaxel. After 4 administrations of weekly paclitaxel, he refused any further intravenous chemotherapy. In February, 2014, CT scan showed pathologic enlargement of the lymphnodes in the obturator fossa (bilateral, 2&#x200A;cm), as well as in the interaortocaval (2&#x200A;cm max) and in the iliac (right, 2&#x200A;cm max) space, measured according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria. Bone marrow, heart, lung, and hepatic function was within normal limits, consistently with the patient's age and medical history, but the glomerular filtration rate was moderately reduced (42&#x200A;mL/min; Cockcroft-Gault). The patient, who presented grade 2 fatigue (fatigue not relieved by rest and limiting instrumental activities of daily living) and an ECOG PS of 2, was started on oral cyclophosphamide (100&#x200A;mg a day) after obtaining written informed consent to treatment. In an attempt to relieve fatigue, the patient was also suggested to consume quercetin (1&#x200A;g a day) as a nutritional dietary supplement. In April 2014, the patient showed a partial radiological response, whereas fatigue and PS had improved to grade 1 and ECOG 1, respectively. In July 2014, a complete response was reported on CT scan according to the RECIST criteria 1.1, with shrinkage of all previously enlarged lymph nodes (short axis, max 1&#x200A;cm) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The patient had increased consumption of quercetin (2&#x200A;g/a day), although he was discouraged to consume daily doses &gt;1&#x200A;g. During the 56 weeks administration period, the patient continued to receive cyclophosphamide and kept on consuming &#x223C;2&#x200A;g a day of quercetin, with no significant adverse events. CT scans were repeated at 3 month intervals. Radiological progression was reported in March 2015, with widespread pelvic and abdominal lymphnode disease. Although the patient showed grade 2 anemia and grade 3 fatigue and his PS was 2, he consented to receive intravenous weekly paclitaxel, but had to interrupt treatment after 1 cycle for persisting grade 3 fatigue and grade 3 anemia. He died in November, 2015.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>In the case presented here, the use of single-agent cyclophosphamide was associated with a confirmed radiological response and prolonged progression-free survival with minimal toxicity and excellent compliance in an elderly patient who had been pretreated with 2 lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease. The patient had received platinum-based chemotherapy and taxane agent paclitaxel. Paclitaxel, which is accepted as a standard second-line treatment option,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> was preferred to vinflunine as vinflunine was associated with grade 3&#x2013;4 constipation in 16.1% of patients enrolled in the phase III trial on vinflunine versus best supportive care.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> We are unaware of published data regarding the use of single-agent cyclophosphamide in urothelial carcinoma. In a phase I/II trial exploring the use of paclitaxel plus cyclophosphamide, Di Lorenzo<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> et al that concluded that 50&#x200A;mg was the maximum tolerated daily dose of oral cyclophosphamide administered on days 1 to 7 concomitantly with 175&#x200A;mg/m<sup>2</sup> of intravenous paclitaxel on day 1. In the 32 patients enrolled in the phase II part of the trial, the median time to progression was 5 months (95% CI, 2 &#x2013;7.5 months), whereas the median OS was 8 months (95% CI, 4&#x2013;14 months), with grade 1/2 vomiting, peripheral neuropathy, and neutropenia reported in 34%, 25%, and 31% of cases, respectively, and grade 3&#x2013;4 neutropenia occurring in 34.5 % of patients. Of note, no complete response was reported, with approximately one-third of patients showing a partial radiological response. In a separate phase II trial,<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> 46 patients diagnosed with bladder or upper urinary tract cancer were treated with paclitaxel+cyclophosphamide at the same doses used by Di Lorenzo et al, although cyclophosphamide was administered for 3 weeks after the first cycle. The median time to progression is 3 months (95% CI 1.7&#x2013;4.3 months), with an objective response rate of 33.3% and a median OS of 6.3 months (95% CI 4.6&#x2013;8.0 months). Of note, 1 patient reported a complete radiologic response. Different from the results by Di Lorenzo et al, grade &#x2265; 3 neutropenia occurred only in 2 patients (6%), with one of them developing febrile neutropenia. The most clinically significant nonhematologic toxicities reported were grade 1&#x2013;2 myalgia (28%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (56%), and fatigue (35%). The toxicity profile associated with the use of single-agent cyclophosphamide in the case presented here compares favorably with that of paclitaxel+cyclophosphamide discussed above. The patient did not report any adverse event, and he also experienced improvement of fatigue, which we speculate it may be associated with quercetin consumption due to the quercetin effect on glucose metabolism and inflammation. Cancer-related fatigue has been associated with a number of causative factors, including inflammatory processes, disruption of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland axis, as well as metabolic disturbances with decreased ATP production.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Similar to other flavonols, quercetin is able to decrease TNF-alfa and IL-6 serum levels.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Preclinical data show that quercetin is able to boost cellular metabolism by increasing the activity of AMPK, a key energy-sensor enzyme that stimulates skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation and muscle glucose uptake. In 1 in vitro study conducted in a mouse myoblast cell line exposed to 50 or 100&#x200A;&#x3BC;M quercetin, stimulation of AMPK resulted in decreased activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and increased fatty acid transportation into the mitochondria.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> In mice randomly assigned to either placebo or 12.5&#x200A;mg/kg quercetin or 25&#x200A;mg/kg quercetin and undergoing a treadmill performance run to fatigue, quercetin increased markers of mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1alpha, cytochrome <italic>c</italic>) and improved both maximal endurance capacity and voluntary wheel-running activity.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> These results paralleled those obtained in clinical trials, with 1 meta-analysis showing that quercetin supplementation was associated with increased endurance performance.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In the case presented here, we obtained a marked improvement in fatigue and a complete and prolonged radiologic response in a patient treated with third-line chemotherapy. Only a few studies have been conducted in this setting. Matsumoto<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> et al evaluated the efficacy of gemcitabine plus nedaplatin in 10 patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma who had been previously treated with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin, followed by gemcitabine and paclitaxel. The median overall survival was 8.8 months, whereas the median progression-free survival was 5 months. Similarly, the use of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin as a third-line chemotherapy was associated with a median progression-free survival and overall survival of 4.1 and 6.3 months in 23 patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma, whereas median time to progression and overall survival were 2 and 7.3 months, respectively, in 13 patients treated with third-line gemcitabine.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> These findings confirm the poor prognosis of patients treated for advanced urothelial carcinoma in the third-line setting and highlight the need for novel therapeutic options. Immunotherapy holds a great promise for advanced urothelial carcinoma.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> As an example, a novel anti-PD-1 agent was associated with clinical activity in a phase I study in metastatic bladder cancer.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Low-dose metronomic cyclophosphamide, which can induce antitumor in vivo immunity,<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> may synergize with novel immunotherapy agents<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> via depletion of regulatory T cells.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p>

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <p>This case shows that a novel combination of metronomic cyclophosphamide plus quercetin may have an antineoplastic and antifatigue effect with an excellent safety profile. Complete responses are rare in bladder cancer patients, whereas very few agents have a demonstrated antifatigue effect. Further studies are required to assess the potential benefits associated with the combined use of cyclophosphamide plus quercetin in advanced bladder cancer patients.</p>
