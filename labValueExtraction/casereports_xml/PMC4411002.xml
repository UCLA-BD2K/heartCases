          <title>Background</title>
          <p><italic>PIK3CA</italic>-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) include a group of disorders that affect only the terminal portion of a limb, such as type I macrodactyly, and conditions like fibroadipose overgrowth (FAO), megalencephaly-capillary malformation (MCAP) syndrome, congenital lipomatous asymmetric overgrowth of the trunk, lymphatic, capillary, venous, and combined-type vascular malformations, epidermal nevi, skeletal and spinal anomalies (CLOVES) syndrome and Hemihyperplasia Multiple Lipomatosis (HHML). Heterozygous postzygotic <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations are frequently identified in these syndromes, while timing and tissue specificity of the mutational event are likely responsible for the extreme phenotypic variability observed.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec002">
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>We carried out a combination of Sanger sequencing and targeted deep sequencing of genes involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in three patients (1 MCAP and 2 FAO) to identify causative mutations, and performed immunoblot analyses to assay the phosphorylation status of AKT and P70S6K in affected dermal fibroblasts. In addition, we evaluated their ability to grow in the absence of serum and their response to the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

          <title>Results and Conclusion</title>
          <p>Our data indicate that patients&#x2019; cells showed constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Of note, PI3K pharmacological blockade resulted in a significant reduction of the proliferation rate in culture, suggesting that inhibition of PI3K might prove beneficial in future therapies for PROS patients.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In 1997 Cynthia A. Moore <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] described a new sporadic overgrowth disorder with a combination of anomalies including macrocephaly, megalencephaly, cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita and foot abnormalities different from the condition known as cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita.</p>
      <p>In the following years, two megalencephaly (MEG) syndromes were recognized: the megalencephaly-capillary malformation (MCAP) syndrome, formerly called macrocephaly-capillary malformation (MCM) syndrome, characterized by involvement of the CNS, growth dysregulation with body asymmetry (hemihyperplasia), vascular anomalies and distal limb malformations (polydactyly and syndactyly), and the closely related megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome, which lacks the vascular malformations and syndactyly of MCAP. These two easily recognizable and sporadic conditions show similar brain involvement with (hemi)megalencephaly, ventriculomegaly, polymicrogyria, and cerebellar tonsillar ectopia progressing to Chiari anomaly; this suggests that they are due to <italic>de novo</italic> mutations of genes of the same pathway [<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. So far, <italic>PIK3CA</italic> postzygotic mutations have been described in almost all cases of MCAP/MPPH, while mutations in the <italic>AKT3</italic> and <italic>PIK3R2</italic> genes have been detected in a few cases [<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Very recently, <italic>de novo</italic> heterozygous activating mutations in the <italic>CCND2</italic> gene (encoding cyclin D2) were identified in MPPH patients lacking upstream PI3K/AKT pathway mutations [<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>Postzygotic mutations in the <italic>PIK3CA</italic> gene have also been identified in distinct overgrowth syndromes such as CLOVES (congenital lipomatous asymmetric overgrowth of the trunk, lymphatic, capillary, venous, and combined-type vascular malformations, epidermal nevi, skeletal and spinal anomalies), HHML (Hemihyperplasia Multiple Lipomatosis) and fibroadipose overgrowth (FAO) [<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. CLOVES syndrome differs from MCAP syndrome for a more marked growth dysregulation, with lipomatous tissues showing complex congenital overgrowth (typically appearing as a truncal lipomatous mass) and a combination of vascular and lymphatic malformations. FAO shares clinical and molecular features with CLOVES syndrome and may involve the trunk or extremities. It is characterized by progressive segmental overgrowth in various regions of the body including visceral, subcutaneous, muscular, fibroadipose, and skeletal tissues.</p>
      <p>Recently, for all these clinical entities characterized by the presence of activating somatic mutations in the PIK3CA gene, the new term of PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS) has been proposed so to comprehend the broad range of clinical manifestations in these patients [<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>To identify causative mutations in three patients with clinical symptoms consistent with PROS, we performed Sanger sequencing and targeted deep sequencing of 21 selected genes involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in three patients, one affected by MCAP, and two by FAO. In three of them we identified a causative mutation in the PIK3CA gene, which encodes the p110&#x3B1; catalytic subunit of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase heterodimer. Moreover, we evaluated the phosphorylation status of AKT and P70S6K in primary affected dermal fibroblasts and assessed cell growth upon treatment with PI3K inhibitors.</p>

          <p>Patient 1, a female aged 10 years and 4 months, is the first of two children of a healthy 38-year-old woman and a non-consanguineous 48-year-old man, whose family history was unremarkable. She was conceived naturally. The fetal ultrasound scan at gestational week (gw) 12 was normal, while at gw 21 a choroid plexus cyst and echogenic intracardiac focus were detected, the biparietal diameter was at the 95<sup>th</sup> centile at gw 21 and &gt;95<sup>th</sup> centile at gw 33 with normal cerebral morphology. She was born at the 34<sup>th</sup> gw with a weight of 3080 g (90-97<sup>th</sup> centile), length of 49 cm (90<sup>th</sup> centile) and head circumference of 35.6 cm (97<sup>th</sup> centile). At birth, a diffuse capillary malformation involving the trunk and limbs was observed, associated with cutaneous syndactyly of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> toes (<xref rid="pone.0123092.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>). During the first year of life, a plantar epidermal nevus and a small hemangioma, which subsequently disappeared, were observed, together with left hemihyperplasia (detected at the age of 3 months).</p>

          <p>Cardiac and abdominal ultrasound scans were repeatedly normal. Brain MRI scans detected increased peritrigonal signal of white matter at the age of 10 months and focal hemimegalencephaly with perisylvian polymicrogyria at the age of 7 years. From the age of 7 years, the girl had episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures refractory to antiepileptic therapy. She suffers from mild cognitive impairment and attention deficit disorder, and in the last years had temper tantrums and angry outbursts.</p>
          <p>On physical examination at the age of 10 years and 4 months, her weight was 35 kg (25<sup>th</sup>-50<sup>th</sup> centile), height 138 cm (25<sup>th</sup>-50<sup>th</sup> centile) and head circumference 60 cm (+ 5.2 SD). She had left hemihyperplasia, involving face, trunk and limbs (mainly legs) with diffusely soft and thick irregularly marbled skin and prominent capillaries and veins on the trunk, abdomen and limbs. Three small (diameter &lt;0.5 cm) achromic spots were observed on the trunk. Her 3<sup>rd</sup> right finger was significantly larger than the contralateral one and she had a bilateral proximal 4/5 cutaneous syndactyly of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> toes. Besides macrosomia, she had dysmorphic features including malar hypoplasia, hypertelorism (inner canthal distance &gt;97<sup>th</sup> centile, palpebral length + 1 SD), long philtrum (&gt;97<sup>th</sup> centile) and high palate, and S-shaped scoliosis.</p>

          <title>Patient 2</title>
          <p>Patient 2, the only daughter of healthy non-consanguineous parents, presented to our observation at 12 years of age with a history of macrodactyly of the right 4<sup>th</sup> finger diagnosed at birth (<xref rid="pone.0123092.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>). Histological examination carried out after surgical excisions performed at 3 and 5 years of age showed fibrolipomatous tissue. At 6 years of age, disease recurrence was observed, with two nodular areas (14 and 11.2 mm in diameter) revealed by ultrasound scan of the right hand soft tissues. Such areas, located adjacent to the shaft of the middle and distal phalanges, showed uneven distribution and no evidence of bone overgrowth or distortion at X-ray examination. No development of further lesions was observed at follow-up at age 18, except for a small angioma between the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> right metacarpal bones, and increased volume of the already existing fibrolipomas of the right 4<sup>th</sup> finger.</p>

          <title>Patient 3</title>
          <p>The proband is the first and only son of healthy, non-consanguineous parents. At birth, macrodactyly of the left 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> fingers was noted. Radiological examination showed that overgrowth involved the soft tissues and all skeletal segments (phalangeal and metacarpal bones) of the affected rays. Thus, a provisional diagnosis of apparently isolated true congenital macrodactyly was done and a periodical clinical follow-up was suggested. Over time, the two enlarged fingers showed disproportionate overgrowth. Moreover, at 6 months of age, a soft swelling appeared at the left deltoid region, which was sonographically compatible with a subcutaneous mass of adipose tissue, and, at 10 months of age, a slight overgrowth of the left arm and forearm was noted. These clinical signs suggested a diagnostic hypothesis of Proteus-like syndrome. Because of the negative functional and postural consequences of excessive volume and weight of the abnormal fingers, a surgical intervention was performed when the proband was 1 year and 3 months old to remove the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> left fingers by amputation (<xref rid="pone.0123092.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>). Skin biopsies from the affected regions were obtained during this procedure. So far, surveillance measures revealed no abnormalities. Psychomotor development seems to be normal and physical examination revealed no significant craniofacial dysmorphism.</p>

        <title>Molecular and biochemical analyses</title>
        <p>Mutational analysis of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> exons and adjacent intronic regions was performed by Sanger sequencing methods on genomic DNA isolated from blood samples, tissue biopsies, and cultured dermal fibroblasts. No pathogenic variants were found, except for the point mutation c.241 G&gt;A [p.E81K] in <italic>PIK3CA</italic> exon 1 detected in patient 1. This mutation was identified in heterozygosity in hair follicles, saliva, left leg biopsy, and left and right leg cultured dermal fibroblasts of the proband, but was undetectable in the patient's blood and in her parents (<xref rid="pone.0123092.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>).</p>
        <p>Considering the limited sensitivity of Sanger sequencing for detecting low-level mosaic mutations, we performed targeted deep sequencing of 21 selected genes involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway both in blood and tissue/biopsy/cell culture samples of the three patients.</p>
        <p>The mean coverage depth per sample was 1900X with a mean percentage of reads on target of 93.75%. The percentage of ROI with a minimum coverage of 200X was 97.22%, see Table C in <xref rid="pone.0123092.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>.</p>
        <p>This approach confirmed the presence of the c.241 G&gt;A [p.E81K] mutation in the right and left leg biopsies of patient 1, with mutant allele frequencies of 9% and 21.5%, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0123092.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d</xref>).</p>
        <p>In both patients with a clinical diagnosis of FAO (patients 2 and 3), targeted deep sequencing analysis led to the identification of a <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation in primary fibroblasts samples only. Specifically, a c.3140 A&gt;G [p.H1047R] mutation was identified in cultured dermal fibroblasts of patient 2 with a frequency of 9.1% (74/811 reads) (<xref rid="pone.0123092.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d</xref>) and a c.3140 A&gt;T [p.H1047L] mutation was identified in the 2<sup>nd</sup> finger tissue biopsy of patient 3 with a frequency of 15.5% (116/746 reads) (<xref rid="pone.0123092.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d</xref>). As shown in Fig <xref rid="pone.0123092.g001" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0123092.g001" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, respectively, the c.3140 A&gt;G [p.H1047R] mutation was undetectable by Sanger sequencing, whereas the c.3140 A&gt;T [p.H1047L] mutation was visible with this method in DNA derived from fibroblast cultures, but was absent in blood samples (data not shown).</p>
        <p><italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations have been previously identified in several types of cancer, where they overactivate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in the absence of growth factors [<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, to functionally characterize these mutations in our patients, we cultured primary dermal fibroblasts from skin biopsies of overgrowth lesions in the absence of serum. According to our immunoblotting results (Fig <xref rid="pone.0123092.g002" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0123092.g002" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), mutant cells (fibroblasts from biopsy of patient 2, and from left and right leg biopsies of patient 1) showed increased levels of phosphorylated AKT at threonine 308, a residue targeted by PI3K in a direct or indirect (through PDK1) manner, when compared to IMR90 primary human normal fibroblasts. Moreover, patients&#x2019; cells showed increased phosphorylation of another AKT residue, serine 473, which is targeted by the TORC2 complex (mTOR/Rictor) in a PI3K-dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In order to fully characterize the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade, we also evaluated the phosphorylation status of p70S6K, a direct substrate of the TORC1 complex (mTOR/Raptor). Our results showed that phosphorylation of serine 371, was significantly increased in overgrowing cells compared to normal healthy cells.</p>

        <p>To complete the functional characterization of our patients&#x2019; primary fibroblasts, we treated these cells with the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 in the absence of growth factor stimulation. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0123092.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b</xref>, overactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was abrogated by pharmacological inhibition of PI3K in all patients tested as shown by the evaluation of the phosphorylation status of p-AKT and p-p70S6K. Importantly, patient-derived fibroblasts showed the ability to grow in culture even in the absence of growth factors, thus mimicking <italic>in vivo</italic> overgrowth features, while IMR90 primary human normal fibroblasts failed to proliferate in serum starvation conditions (<xref rid="pone.0123092.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref>). Moreover, growth factor-independent proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> was significantly decreased by the pharmacological blockade of PI3K by both wortmannin and LY294002 in affected cells (<xref rid="pone.0123092.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref>), suggesting that this approach could be beneficial in overgrowth patients.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our data support the hypothesis that <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations can be responsible for a wide clinical spectrum of segmental overgrowth disorders. Identical mutations have been found in phenotypically distinct disorders; however, to date any correlation with genotype is suggested but not confirmed [<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The c.241 G&gt;A [p.E81K] mutation identified in a patient with MCAP, patient 1, has been described previously in only one case of MCAP [<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This mutation involves the residue 81 in the Ras-binding domain of PI3K and to our knowledge no functional analysis for this mutation has been ever performed on cells of affected patients.</p>
      <p>According to Keppler-Nereuil [<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] this patient should be categorized as PROS-A.</p>
      <p>The <italic>PIK3CA</italic> c.3140 A&gt;G [p.H1047R] mosaic mutation identified in patient 2 with overgrowth confined only to the right 4<sup>th</sup> finger diagnosed at birth, has been observed in patients with KTS, CLOVES and very severe FAO, but also in cases of isolated macrodactyly [<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. On the basis of the clinical spectrum of this patient (see <xref rid="sec017" ref-type="sec">results</xref>), after the positive testing for PIK3CA mutation, this patient would be classified as PROS B. It is worth noting that the <italic>PIK3CA</italic> c.3140 A&gt;G [p.H1047R] change is the most common cancer-associated <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation [<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, in affected tissues of overgrowth disorder patients, it is isolated and associated to a variable mutation burden, as opposed to what happens in a tumor, where it is one of several somatic mutations.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the c.3140 A&gt;T [p.H1047L] mutation identified in patient 3, with clinical presentation consistent with FAO, has been already described in FAO and in isolated macrodactyly type I cases, and was also reported in more than 130 human cancers in the COSMIC Database. The initial classification of this patient at referral would have been PROS B, however, after clinical follow up, he was more precisely matching the PROS A presentation.</p>
      <p>Our functional studies on primary patient-derived fibroblasts showed overactivation of the PI3K pathway and PI3K-dependent proliferation in affected cells for all mutations analyzed. Indeed, patients&#x2019;derived cells were able to grow <italic>in vitro</italic> in the absence of growth factors and mitogens, while displaying a significantly reduced proliferation rate upon PI3K pharmacological inhibition by both wortmannin and LY294002. Very recent reports have demonstrated that oncogenic PIK3CA mutations cause activation of PI3K pathway and proliferative advantage in cells derived from lymphatic malformations [<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our data, show that the two mutations functionally studied [H1047R, E81K] behave similarly in PROS patient-derived fibroblast.</p>
      <p>No malignancies were identified in our patients. Although an increased cancer risk cannot be ruled out in patients with somatic <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations, data are currently very limited. This is not surprising considering that only in recent years researchers began to identify mutations associated with these disorders, which were often misdiagnosed and superficially classified as Proteus or Proteus-like syndromes [<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Keppler-Noreuil et al. [<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] described a patient diagnosed with FAO harboring a mosaic c.3140 A&gt;T [p.H1047L] mutation that developed premalignant features of nephrogenic rests and a second patient, diagnosed with CLOVES, who had an ovarian cystadenoma; In addition, Kurek <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] reported the case of a CLOVES patient with a mosaic c.3140 A&gt;G [p.H1047R] mutation, who was affected by Wilms' tumor. In another report, two cases of Wilms' tumor, one case of leukemia, two cases of meningioma and one case of medulloblastoma were described, respectively, in five MCAP and one MPHH patient. However, these patients' diagnoses were merely clinical, with no molecular characterization of the underlying disorders [<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>Surgical debulking and orthopedic procedures are the only treatments currently available for patients with segmental overgrowth syndromes [<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, considering that the investigation of small molecule inhibitors of the PI3K signaling network is a promising area of oncology drug development, in the next few years these patients may well benefit from the results of completed and ongoing clinical trials on PI3K inhibitors in cancer therapy. For example, an improved wortmannin chemical analog, PX-866, displayed antitumor activity in preclinical models and is currently being tested in various clinical trials [<xref rid="pone.0123092.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For all of these reasons, PROS patients might be regarded as very appropriate candidates for enrollment in trials based on PI3K inhibitors. In fact, they display an ideal "clean" cellular setting, as they carry only a single <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation while lacking the host of somatic mutations that usually characterize tumors and that can interfere with/modulate the complex mechanisms regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. On the other side, they would need long-term therapies and thus should be treated with drugs with very limited and acceptable side effects.</p>
      <p>The results presented in this study, strengthen the idea that patients with these rare and often neglected syndromes, may represent the target of future trials using clinically available inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathways.</p>
