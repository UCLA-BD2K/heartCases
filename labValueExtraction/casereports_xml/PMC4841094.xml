      <abstract>
        <p>The purpose of this study is to communicate findings from a case study on a South African mother with three children diagnosed with full mutation fragile X syndrome (FXS). The participant is an unaffected carrier of FXS. Research has shown that mothers of children with FXS often experience high levels of parenting stress and low levels of psychological well-being. However, observations made have piqued curiosity about their positivity and determination to carry on each day raising children diagnosed with FXS. The aim is to develop a better understanding of the manner in which a mother of children with FXS make sense of her situation, to gain further insight into the specific resilience processes she acquired. A qualitative case study approach was followed, gathering data through semi-structured interviews based on open-ended questions. The findings offer new insights into a South African mother's life raising children with FXS. Even though there is very limited support and little awareness of FXS in South Africa, she still found ways to seek help, and find solutions to every day challenges. The study conclusions discourage blind stereotyping of mothers of children with FXS as vulnerable only. Future research should concentrate on promoting awareness, education, advocacy, and support for individuals with FXS in South Africa.</p>

  <body>
    <p>In South Africa, disabled individuals and their families have limited support and available resources. It is the sole responsibility of these families to care for their disabled child themselves. They are responsible for any financial costs of professional services the child might need (Greeff &amp; Nolting, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). To date, literature on the experiences of parents raising children diagnosed with fragile X syndrome (FXS), as well as the processes involved to ensure resilience among these parents is limited. This study aims to add knowledge and create awareness on everyday experiences of a parent living with children diagnosed with FXS, in South Africa.</p>
    <p>I was a live-in carer to an adolescent female diagnosed with full mutation FXS living in the United States of America in 2008. During my time as live-in carer, I was able to learn more about FXS and complete my studies concentrating on resilience and FXS. In 2014, while completing research in South Africa, it came to my attention that many professional South Africans are uninformed and unaware of this condition. I realized that there is a need to create awareness on the syndrome, specifically in South Africa.</p>
    <p>Significant challenges are experienced by parents rearing a child with an intellectual disability (Sterling, Barnum, Skinner, Warren, &amp; Flemming, <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). These specific challenges may cause parents to experience high levels of emotional and personal tension, which in turn will impact on the psychological well-being of not only the affected child but the entire family unit collectively (Sarimski, <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). However, some mothers of children diagnosed with FXS have been found to be positive and determined to carry on each day, despite the adversities they are faced with (Hauser, Kover, &amp; Abbeduto, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Poehlmann, Clements, Abbeduto, &amp; Farsad, <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). This prompted the following research question: What are the experiences of a mother raising children diagnosed with FXS? More specifically, this research has two objectives:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To understand and identify specific challenges of a mother, who is an unaffected carrier, raising children diagnosed with FXS;</p></list-item><list-item><p>
To gain further insight into the specific resilience processes she acquired.</p></list-item></list>The information gathered from this research will provide parents, educators, and health care professionals with a greater understanding of how parents experience and cope with raising children diagnosed with FXS, specifically in South Africa. Improved knowledge will enable parents to relate to others in similar situations, and educators and health care professionals to be better informed and to assist parents of children with FXS.</p>
    <sec id="S0002">
      <title>Defining FXS</title>
      <p>FXS is the most common hereditary cause of intellectual disability currently known around the world (Cornish, Turk, &amp; Hagerman, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Essop &amp; Krause, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Fernandez Carvajal &amp; Aldridge, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Kesler, Lightbody, &amp; Reiss, <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). FXS is a genetic disorder, so called because of a fragile site on the tip of the long arm of the X chromosome where, although not quite separated, it looks as though the end is broken off.</p>
      <p>Individuals with no obvious signs or characteristics of FXS can pass it on in a family. Both boys and girls with FXS will have a mother with a permutation or a full mutation. These women have a 50% risk of passing on the abnormal X chromosome to each child. Sons inheriting the X chromosome carrying a full mutation will have FXS, while daughters who inherit the mutation have about a 50% risk of showing features of this syndrome. For women carrying smaller permutations, the risk of expanding to a full mutation in the next generation is a little lower depending on the number of Cytosine&#x2014;Guanine&#x2014;Guanine (CGG) repeats. A woman who carries a FX permutation could have inherited the mutation from her mother or her father. For men with a permutation all their daughters, but none of their sons will be carriers (Hagerman, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Hagerman &amp; Hagerman, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Harris-Schmidt &amp; Fast, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p>

      <title>Parenting children diagnosed with FXS</title>
      <p>Various studies have concentrated on identifying how having and raising a child with intellectual impairment affects health symptoms in parents and contribute to extraordinary challenges for them (Bailey, Skinner, &amp; Sparkman, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Hartley, Seltzer, Head, &amp; Abbeduto, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Minnes &amp; Steiner, <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Smith, Seltzer, &amp; Greenberg, <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). According to Smith et al. (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), their physical health, and social and emotional well-being are affected as described below.</p>
      <p>Mothers of children with FXS were found to have more distinct headaches, backaches, muscle soreness, fatigue, dizziness, and hot flushes than mothers of children without any impairment due to the stress experienced caring for their children affected by FXS (Smith et al., <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). High levels of depression, anxiety, and stress were reported amongst parents of children with FXS (Gane et al., <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Lewis et al., <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>, McCarthy, Cuskelly, Van Kraayenoord, &amp; Cohen, <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Wheeler et al., <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Furthermore, they experienced isolation, reduced levels of parenting confidence, and feeling overwhelmed due to their children's high levels of behaviour problems (Johnston et al., <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Wheeler, Hatton, Reichardt, &amp; Bailey, <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Parents were found to interact less and spent less time with their children and developed high levels of pessimism about their child's future (Abbeduto et al., <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Lewis et al., <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>The time of diagnosis is found to be a traumatic experience amongst parents and many reported problems in the diagnostic process, such as series of misdiagnoses, lack of support during and after diagnosis, lack of understanding, seeking supportive healthcare providers, the waiting lists to receive services, not knowing the nature of the disability, lack of knowledge and information available, interest in learning of healthcare providers, and the fact that they were often left to their own devices (Minnes &amp; Steiner, <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). A study done by Baker, Seltzer, and Greenberg (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) reported that behaviour problems of individuals with FXS had a negative impact on parents&#x2019; marriages. Furthermore, the diagnosis of FXS has been found to cause families&#x2019; excessive financial burden, and impact their employment. This in turn results into a lowered quality of life and takes a prolonged toll on family finances (Wong, Mailick, Greenberg, Hong, &amp; Coe, <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Furthermore, it takes a toll on family interactions and communications (Baker et al., <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p>

    <sec id="S0004">
      <title>Resilience as coping mechanism</title>
      <p>In order to be seen as resilient, it is necessary to experience risks (Luthar, Cicchietti, &amp; Becker, <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Risk refers to characteristics, traits, or experiences that predicts negative outcomes (Wright &amp; Masten, <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) and can be present in individuals (intrapersonal), their families, as well as their environments (interpersonal) (Boyden &amp; Mann, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Mash &amp; Wolfe, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Caring for children with a mental impairment such as FXS denotes risk as discussed above.</p>
      <p>Resilience is seen as a process that involves transactions between the individual and his or her social ecology (Sameroff, <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Ungar, <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In order to acquire resilience, the individual's environment needs to make resources available, but also the individual should navigate towards and make use of these protective resources (Ungar, <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). According to Kumpfer (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), to be considered to be resilient, involves the following stages:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The individual experience challenges.</p></list-item><list-item><p>There are certain resources available in the environment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The individual interact with the environment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The individual's internal resources, such as spiritual, intellectual, social, physical, and psychological skills, buffer against the challenges.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The individual develop the necessary coping skills to cope with the challenges she may experience.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The individual achieve the positive outcome.</p></list-item></list>These stages support and are in line with the understanding of resilience as an ecologically embedded bi-directional process (Lerner, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). In other words, resilience is seen as a continual cooperative transaction between the individual and her context, influenced by her ecology (Lerner, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Ungar, <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>A brief review of the protective resources found in previous studies focusing on resilience in family members of children diagnosed with disabilities is provided, as they align well with the context of my current study. Protective resources refer to processes that encourage resilience and influence an individual's ability to function resiliently. According to Ungar (<xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), protective resources refer to variables that decrease the impact of challenges an individual is faced with and therefore reduce the possibility of negative outcomes. When referring to protective resources, they are grouped as intrapersonal resources and interpersonal resources. It is important to remember that protective resources alone do not guarantee resilience (Rutter, <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>), but the processes rooted in these resources (Unger, <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>Individual protective resources typically include attractiveness, assertiveness, autonomy, internal locus of control, intelligence, empathy, outgoing temperament, optimism, self-awareness, peacefulness, positive self-esteem, self-efficacy, social competency, and sense of humour (Carter, Martinez-Pedraza, &amp; Gray, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Ekas, Lickenbrock, &amp; Whitman, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Knestrict &amp; Kuchey, <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Kuhn &amp; Carter, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Kumpfer, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; McMurray, Connolly, Preston-Shoot, &amp; Wigley, <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Masten, Cutuli, Herbers, &amp; Reed, <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>Protective resources within the social ecology typically include family connectedness (Bayat, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Breitkreuz, Wunderli, Savage, &amp; McConnell, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Greeff &amp; Nolting, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), social support (Breitkreuz et al., <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Ekas et al., <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), financial resources (Breitkreuz et al., <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), durability of family (Greeff &amp; Nolting, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), access to mentors (Masten et al., <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), communication (Greeff &amp; Nolting, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and religious beliefs and spiritual resources (Bayat, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Breitkreuz et al., <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Ekas et al., <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Greeff &amp; Nolting, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Masten &amp; Wright, <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>Despite the limited nature of what we know about the resilience of parents caring for children with FXS, resilience-focused studies have encouraged more positive understandings of how parents of children with disabilities cope. Although I found some studies on resilience in generalised contexts of parents of children with disabilities, I could locate only two studies focusing on the well-being of parents of children with FXS (Hauser et al., <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Poehlmann et al., <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Furthermore, only one study could be found in relation to resilience found in an adolescent with FXS (Fourie &amp; Theron, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). I therefore saw this as an opportunity to explore a South African mother's experiences raising children with FXS and exploring what contributed to her resilience and making this public.</p>

      <sec id="S0005-S20001">
        <title>Study design</title>
        <p>The research objective was to study a single subject in South Africa over time and to collect detailed information about the participant (Creswell, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Mertens, <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Therefore, a qualitative, single case study research design was followed (Creswell, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), anchored in the interpretive paradigm (Merriam, <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Stake, <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">1975</xref>). Making use of an interpretive paradigm allowed me to try to understand the experiences of the mother raising children with FXS, through the meanings that she assigned to them (Merriam, <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Nieuwenhuis, <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2007a</xref>; Stake, <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">1975</xref>). In other words, I interpreted what the participant told me during the data collection process, and realized that what she told me is her interpretation of reality. This perspective located my work in the post-modern realm (Nieuwenhuis, <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2007a</xref>). It helped me to better understand the participant's experiences, making sense of her struggles, and determining the processes that allow her to cope with her daily challenges. Case studies such as these (Mertens, <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) can offer rich contributions to theory and practice, which strengthened my motivation to report this case. Descriptive and in-depth data were collected in order to gain greater understanding of the participant's life and experiences (Hays &amp; Singh, <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="S0005-S20002">
        <title>Instruments</title>
        <p>The data were collected by means of interviews and in situ observations. Observations were made during informal meetings as well as during the interviews, and were recorded in a reflection journal (Merriam, <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). The research journal helped to enhance the trustworthiness of the findings (Nieuwenhuis, <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2007b</xref>). I interviewed the participant twice and made use of semi-structured interviews, based on open-ended questions. Semi-structured interviews were used as it is characterized much like a conversation that is flexible and exploratory (Merriam, <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>).</p>
        <p>Based on an eco-systemic understanding of resilience (Schoon, <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Ungar, <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), I included questions about how raising children with FXS impacted the participant's life and what resources (intra- and interpersonal) appeared to buffer these impacts. The interviews were recorded in order for it to be transcribed and analysed.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="S0005-S20003">
        <title>Ethical considerations</title>
        <p>Before the study commenced, the ethics board at the University of South Africa at which I am a post-doctoral fellow provided ethical clearance (reference number&#x2014;2014MAY/52287521/MC). The participant was not harmed in any physical or emotional manner. All possible or adequate information on the goal of the investigation; the procedures that were followed during the investigation; the possible advantages, disadvantages, and dangers to which the participant might have been exposed to; as well as my credibility was disclosed to the participant. The participant was given information about what the study entails and what would be expected from the participant. This allowed her to make a voluntary decision to take part in the study. She was able to withdraw from the study at any time.</p>
        <p>The participant was observed and interviewed in her natural setting. I explained to the participant that emotions, such as uneasiness, might be experienced as she recalled previous unpleasant experiences. The participant&#x2019;s real names were not used. I debriefed the participant after the interviews and observations were made. Debriefing can be defined as sessions, after the data were collected, where the participants have the opportunity to work through experiences and their outcomes (Strydom, <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). This occurred after the interviews were transcribed rather than after analysis (Houghton, Casey, Shaw, &amp; Murphy, <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The reason for doing so was to allow the participant to acknowledge and respond to her own words before they are scientifically analysed. The participant had no concerns or reservations about the content of the interview. The transcripts therefore remained unchanged and did not influence the analysis and interpretation of the data.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="S0005-S20004">
        <title>Trustworthiness</title>
        <p>To ensure trustworthiness, peer debriefing was used, where the research process and findings were reviewed and discussed with unbiased colleagues (Shenton, <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The credibility of the findings was checked by means of confirming with the participant if what I understood was correct (Lincoln &amp; Guba, <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Mertens, <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p>
        <p>Due to the fact that I possess specific knowledge on the research subject, it influenced the choice of design and interpretation and conclusion of results to some degree. I knew what I was looking for and was able to be more focused during the data collection process. The literature review allowed me to apply logical reasoning and interpretation of the data collected (Shenton, <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Direct quotations from the interviews that were conducted were included. During the interview process, regular reflexivity took place and was recorded in a research journal. I noted my developing argument, feelings, and interpretations, and reflected on my situatedness in this study. Furthermore, a thick description of the participant and her context to facilitate transferability was provided. Although this does not reduce the limitations of case study methodologies, the working hypothesis that emerges from this study guides transferability.</p>

          <title>Sampling</title>
          <p>Purposive sampling took place, which allowed me to choose a participant from whom most could be learned. A paediatrician with a lot of knowledge about FXS in South Africa was contacted. A meeting was held between the paediatrician and myself, where I explained the needs of the study, in order for the paediatrician to identify a mother of a child or children with FXS in South Africa. The participant had to be coping resiliently with her circumstances (raising children with FXS) and be willing to participate in the study. FXS is fairly unknown in South Africa. It is therefore not as easy to identify people affected by this syndrome. However, the paediatrician identified the participant as resilient. The paediatrician and I met in order to discuss how she understood and defined resilience. She defined resilience as follows: &#x201C;The ability of an individual to adapt to or confront stresses or adversity of many different natures. Being able to overcome and successfully live with either psychological or physical challenges.&#x201D; I discussed with her how I understood and defined resilience and together we agreed on a definition for resilience: &#x201C;Resilience refers to a process between an individual, her family, community and culture. Even though the individual have faced significant challenges raising children with FXS, she has overcome the risks and demonstrated positive adaptation.&#x201D; The results of the study were therefore more precise as we identified a resilient participant, rather than just randomly choosing a participant. The most could be learned from her.</p>
          <p>The sample size of the study consists of one unaffected carrier, a mother with three children diagnosed with FXS. The reason for including only one participant is that she was the only participant the paediatrician recommended. I saw this as an opportunity to start creating awareness on FXS. The participant was protected from harm during the identification and selection process by first consulting with the identified paediatrician with FXS experience. Once the participant agreed to take part in the study, she was contacted to set a time and place convenient for her to meet.</p>

        <title>Data analysis</title>
        <p>The data that were collected in the study was analysed using deductive qualitative analysis (Miles, <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), which means that prior reading led me to identify topics that could be illustrated by appropriate quotations. The transcribed interviews were read through to get a global impression of the context. I categorized the topics according to the themes that emerged during my literature review of writing up my doctoral thesis, which shed light on resilience as well as explained the challenges the participant experienced raising children diagnosed with FXS. An independent coder (Nieuwenhuis, <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2007b</xref>) was used to justify the themes that were found during analysis of the data (Creswell, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Following the constant comparative method (Merriam, <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>), I made use of observation notes to support what was found in the interviews.</p>

      <title>Findings</title>
      <p>The participant is an Indian mother of three children diagnosed with full mutation FXS, living in Gauteng, South Africa. She is the carrier of the syndrome that was passed on to her and her sisters from their father. She is not intellectually affected by the carrier status. She works full-time as an admin officer at a company based in her community.</p>
      <p>Her children are aged 23 (female), 20 (male), and 16 (female). The two females are not as severely affected as their brother, as males are often more severely affected than females (Saunders, <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). The 23-year-old female is currently attending a beauty college where she is taught certain skills that will enable her to find a job after college. The 20-year-old male and 16-year-old female are still attending school (a special needs school). The family first found out about FXS in 1997. At this time their eldest daughter just started school (and some delays were noticed by teachers). However, the reason for concern was the development of their son, who was four at this time and had not met certain important developmental milestones such as talking. A diagnosis was then made amongst all three children by a paediatrician.</p>
      <p>She has limited access to support. Although her immediate and extended family offered psychosocial support, the community was not as accepting of people with disabilities. In order to receive grants from the government, she had to educate numerous personnel about what FXS is and what their needs are. Often she was sent away as the government officers did not know about FXS and therefore did not see it as a relevant disability. During the time of the interviews, she did not receive any grants for her children from the government.</p>
      <p>Risks refers to characteristics, traits, or experiences that predicts negative outcomes (Wright &amp; Masten, <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) and can be present in individuals (intrapersonal), their families, as well as their environments (interpersonal) (Boyden &amp; Mann, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Mash &amp; Wolfe, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>As stated before, risk is a prerequisite to resilience, and can be defined as intrapersonal (present in the individual) as well as interpersonal (present in families and their environments) characteristics, traits, or experiences that most likely will result in negative outcomes (Boyden &amp; Mann, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Mash &amp; Wolfe, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). As the primary focus of this study is to understand the experiences of a mother raising children with FXS, findings are used to highlight the challenges, as well as the resilience processes the participant acquired to cope with her challenges. The findings are grouped into intrapersonal and interpersonal challenges and protective resources.</p>

        <title>Challenges</title>
        <p>Throughout the interview, it was found that the participant experienced many challenges. Some were related to her emotional well-being, her family, and her community. The challenges that emerged in the interviews will now be discussed.</p>

        <title>Intrapersonal challenges</title>
        <p>The first intrapersonal challenge that was identified during the interviews was feelings of guilt. In the following extract the participant reported blaming herself for passing along the FXS gene:<disp-quote><p>It was hard. It was like, I used to like, uh, blame myself. A lot of times, blame myself.</p></disp-quote>
When asked if finding out about FXS before starting a family would have influenced her decision making about having children her response was:<disp-quote><p>There were times I said I would not have had children.</p></disp-quote>The participant furthermore reported feeling helpless and alone, which can result in or contribute to depression and stress:<disp-quote><p>I cried and I said, is it so difficult for people to actually understand that there is a problem and I need this help.</p></disp-quote>The participant reported feeling worried about the future of her children:<disp-quote><p>Why it is so hard for me to let go&#x2026; My son is finishing school now. Next year. So now, we have to now, make a plan&#x2026; I mean, my kids are big. I have to look at now, what is he going to do after school.</p></disp-quote>She was often the one who had to explain to others what FXS is and what it entails:<disp-quote><p>I had to tell them, listen, this is fragile X, this is the chromosome story&#x2026; So I sat with him like Dr J. did and I said to him this is what I'm talking about, this is what she's got.</p></disp-quote>This was a frustrating experience for her. Furthermore, the diagnostic process was a difficult and time-consuming process:<disp-quote><p>It is not easy for someone to go through that&#x2026; I always say, umm, what I went through; I don't think everybody can handle that. It is very, very difficult. It is very, very challenging &#x2026; It took a while.</p></disp-quote>The participant reported that it took a long time to receive the correct diagnosis. Furthermore, she reported that it was and still is frustrating that people are still unaware of FXS and that it is her responsibility alone to explain to others what the syndrome is all about.</p>

          <title>Challenges within the family</title>
          <p>Challenges that emerged within the family were related to a feeling of isolation, relationships being affected negatively, and the financial impact that raising children with FXS has on a family. During the interviews the participant reported that she felt that her family was different than other families, that her children did not have many friends, and that socializing with peers is a struggle for her children and indirectly affects her:<disp-quote><p>They (my children) live a bit of an isolated life, because I always kept them for myself. I did what I needed to do to help them by to the best I can. But as far as going out and being with people and socialising, I didn't do enough of that. And that, it think, that, it was like not good &#x2026; she did not learn how to socialise.</p></disp-quote>The participant therefore started isolating herself and her family over the years.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, she reported how the diagnosis of FXS had a financial impact on the family:<disp-quote><p>But it was a lot. It was time consuming. Cause I was home with him (my son). So I couldn't work. So it was like all the time, home just to see hospitals or to see doctors and therapy. And then obviously, financially it does, because, it is not just going there. It is also to take off like, with him, a lot of time from work.</p></disp-quote>

          <title>Challenges within the community</title>
          <p>The challenges that emerged within the community were lack of knowledge and understanding, lack of support groups, and lack of help from the government.</p>
          <p>The participant reported saying that it was frustrating for her that very few people knew and still know about FXS. She has taken it upon herself to explain to others:<disp-quote><p>I hope and pray he understands&#x2026; We need to create that awareness&#x2026; people never knew&#x2026; It was difficult, because people did not understand &#x2026; No, and even still, even still, they don't know &#x2026; I had to tell them, listen, this is fragile X, this is the chromosome story&#x2026; You need support, yes &#x2026; But in our case we had a little of it.</p></disp-quote>The participant joined a support group for mothers of children with special needs, and although this should have been a positive and supportive experience and resource for her, her experience was negative. This is illustrated in the following extract from the interviews:<disp-quote><p>It is not easy for someone to go through that. You need support&#x2026; even with the group we had, there was no kids there that had fragile X. It was just my kids. &#x2026; The other support groups they were of different disabilities.</p></disp-quote>The fact that the South African community is still fairly unaware of FXS, and limited support is provided from the government posed as a challenge to the participant, as more support would be helpful:<disp-quote><p>I had to take her and put her in a special school and I had to get funds for it and uh, because they didn't know, they were not as supportive about it &#x2026; Because what I also notice is that, with a disability, if the parents are working. The government here will not give it. Ja, like uh, you have to earn a certain bracket.</p></disp-quote>I recorded the following in my research journal:<disp-quote><p>I have just met with the mother at their family home. They live in a small house in a relatively poor neighbourhood. Both parents work full-time to provide for their children, and with little support, if any from the government I am not sure how they are able to provide additional care or professional services for their children to ensure they reach their full potential.</p></disp-quote>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The challenges identified in this study relating to a mother raising three children which are diagnosed with full mutation FXS, builds on the broader literature that details experiences of parenting children with disabilities. The participant was able to identify numerous challenges that she experienced raising children with FXS, including intrapersonal challenges as well as challenges within her social environment. The intrapersonal challenges that came forth in the interviews were feelings of guilt and blame, concerns about reproduction, feeling helpless and alone, feeling worried about the future, the burden of educating others, and challenges during the diagnostic process. The interpersonal challenges that were identified were the feeling of isolation, negative impacts on relationships, financial impacts, lack of knowledge and understanding among the community, lack of support, and lack of help from the government. However, the participant was able to overcome the adversities and cope well with her challenges.</p>
      <p>The participant's tenacity, empathy for others, self-awareness, high levels of self-esteem, internal locus of control, and positive outlook guided her towards resources and experiences that supported her. At the same time, her protective social ecology (supportive family members, stable and supportive marriage, quality family time, supportive community, community resources, and religious beliefs and spirituality) nurtured and enabled her to cope with her daily challenges. These resources created the opportunity for her to experience acceptance, which resulted in a positive outlook on life, and having a sense of purpose and contentment. In essence, these protective processes that were identified conceptualises resilience as a supportive person&#x2013;context transaction (Lerner, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Ungar, <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). It therefore demonstrates that positive adjustment depends on both the individual and the individual's social ecology to ensure health-promoting results (Ungar, <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>
Therefore, interactive protective processes, such as interpersonal agency, social support, and religious beliefs and spirituality encouraged the participant's resilience. Her ability to navigate towards resources and resources being available buffered her, and therefore promoted her positive adjustment to the daily challenges of raising children with FXS. Furthermore, the research findings clearly indicate that the mother's ability to cope under difficult circumstances is not merely personality traits, but an ecologically embedded process that includes interpersonal as well as intrapersonal resources.</p>
      <p>The current research only focused on a single case study, which contributes significantly to our current knowledge because it is the first case reported in South Africa and more specifically includes a mother who had three children before the diagnosis were made. The lack of professional and general knowledge of FXS that was experienced by the mother in this case clearly indicates that more research is necessary, and that the sample be expanded to more cases, including the fathers of children with FXS. Research should focus on all ethnical groups in order to optimize the support and other factors in South Africa and cross-cultural understandings of parenting children with disabilities.</p>
      <p>This study does not only concentrate on the negative aspects of raising children with FXS but also offers a positive perspective on raising children diagnosed with FXS. Mothers of children diagnosed with FXS have historically been considered in terms of their vulnerabilities as carers for children with impairments, as well as the results of being carriers of the syndrome (Johnston et al., <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; McCarthy et al., <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Ouyang, Grosse, Raspa, &amp; Bailey, <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Sterling et al., <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Although not all mothers are like this participant and furthermore raising children with FXS is often a challenging experience, reporting this mother's ability to rise above her circumstances resiliently suggests a transformative perspective (Mertens, <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). This study does not only concentrate on the negatives and therefore discourages seeing mothers of children diagnosed with FXS as at risk only.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>This study contributed to literature as it specifically concentrated on a mother of three children diagnosed with FXS. It provides insight into the challenges and the process of resilience in mothers of children with FXS. We now have a better understanding of the challenges the participant faces raising FXS children in South Africa, and the resources that have helped her to be where she is. This understanding will enable and allow parents in similar situations to relate her experiences, and educators and health care professionals to be able to assist parents of children with FXS accordingly. This study therefore discourages negative stereotyping of mothers of children with FXS and hope to encourage communities, and other families to partner with families affected by the diagnoses of FXS, in order to work in partnership with them to promote their resilience.</p>
