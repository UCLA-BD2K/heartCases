        <p>Substitutions, deletions and duplications in the <italic>dystrophin</italic> gene lead to either the severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) or mild Becker muscular dystrophy depending on whether out-of-frame or in-frame transcripts are produced. We identified a DMD case (GS&#x394;44) where the correlation between genotype and phenotype is not respected, even if carrying a typical Duchenne mutation (exon 44 deletion) a Becker-like phenotype was observed. Here we report that in this patient, partial restoration of an in-frame transcript occurs by natural skipping of exon 45 and that this is due to the lack of Celf2a, a splicing factor that interacts with exon 45 in the <italic>dystrophin</italic> pre-mRNA. Several experiments are presented that demonstrate the central role of Celf2a in controlling exon 45 splicing; our data point to this factor as a potential target for the improvement of those DMD therapeutic treatments, which requires exon 45 skipping.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare neuromuscular disease characterized by substitutions, deletions and duplications in the <italic>dystrophin</italic> gene leading to frameshift and premature translation termination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Dystrophin is a cytoskeleton protein which stabilizes the dystrophin-associated protein complex, required for muscle fibre integrity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, and controls gene expression through nNOS activation and nitric oxide-mediated HDAC2 inactivation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. At variance with DMD, the milder form of the disease, the Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), is caused by mutations, including long deletions, which do not perturb the open reading frame (ORF) integrity and produce shorter and partially functional dystrophin isoforms. Deletions in the <italic>dystrophin</italic> gene are found in &#x223C;68% of DMD patients, with the region including exons 44&#x2013;55 being the most commonly mutated, together with the one encompassing exons 2&#x2013;20 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). However, the severity of the pathology is not always predictable by exon deletion, suggesting that each patient has specific deletion breakpoints that may differentially affect splicing. Moreover the &#x2018;reading frame model', in which BMD patients produce a semi-functional, internally deleted dystrophin protein, whereas DMD patients have no detectable protein, is not always respected<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Uncertainty in predicting the Duchenne/Becker pathology indicates that the clinical picture should always be accompanied by a detailed molecular analysis, including transcript structure and dystrophin-associated proteins. Several data indicated that altered splicing patterns in a collection of BMD patients do not directly result from the gene defect but probably derive from modifications in <italic>trans</italic>- rather than <italic>cis</italic>-acting factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p>
    <p>The fact that BMD patients carrying extended deletions display only mild phenotypes, suggested that manipulating the splicing of the dystrophin pre-mRNA, to induce the skipping of specific exons and restore a correct reading frame, could be a powerful strategy for DMD treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. This approach has recently entered into clinical trials through the use of antisense oligonucleotides preventing exon recognition by the splicing machinery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p>
    <p>In this work we have studied a DMD case (GS&#x394;44), in which the correlation between genotype and phenotype is not respected: even if the genetic analysis of the <italic>dystrophin</italic> gene locus showed a deletion of exon 44, which should normally lead to DMD, the patient is now 18 years old and can still walk independently. Molecular analyses on both GS&#x394;44 biopsy and primary myoblasts showed the presence of tiny but consistent dystrophin levels due to endogenous skipping of exon 45. We describe here that this phenotype is due to the lack of the Celf2a protein isoform, that we found to enhance exon 45 inclusion.</p>

        <title>A DMD patient produces dystrophin by natural exon skipping</title>
        <p>An individual (GS&#x394;44) with a DMD genotype (deletion of exon 44 which leads to an out-of-frame transcript) was under study since, quite surprisingly, his clinical and behavioural tests were in agreement more with a Becker phenotype, even if of a severe type. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> summarizes the timed tests from the age of 5 to 18: while DMD patients normally lose ambulance around the age of 12 and need ventilatory support at their late teens, GS&#x394;44 is 18 years old and, even if he has lost the ability to stand up from the ground, he can walk and breath normally.</p>
        <p>A muscle biopsy, performed at the age of 15, indicated the unexpected presence of dystrophin at low but well detectable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). As expected for a dystrophic sample<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> regeneration was occurring: the early myogenic factor myogenin (MYOG) was still expressed, while the terminal differentiation markers, myosin heavy chain (MHC) and muscle creatin kinase (MCK)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, were lower with respect to the biopsy from a healthy control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). Regeneration was also indicated by sustained expression of the proliferative miR-31 and by reduced levels of miR-1 and miR-133, markers of mature muscle fibres<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Since muscle biopsies can vary considerably on the basis of the inflammatory and fibrotic state of the tissue, we derived a culture of primary myoblasts and analysed dystrophin expression upon differentiation in low serum, in parallel to control myocytes derived from a healthy individual. In agreement with the biopsy sample<italic>, in vitro</italic> differentiation confirmed the ability of GS&#x394;44 myocytes to produce dystrophin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). A scaled dilution of proteins from controls indicated that these levels corresponded to &#x223C;7% of those found in healthy myocytes. Interestingly, such low levels of dystrophin paralleled a slower timing of differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>: in fact, myogenin expression was still detectable at day 10, while MHC was reduced in comparison with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). This is in line with the notion that dystrophic cultures show a slower progression into the differentiation process<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, with BMD having on average a less severe differentiation phenotype than DMD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p>
        <p>A detailed mapping of the GS&#x394;44 deletion revealed a 4065, bp deletion, encompassing exon 44, with the fusion between nucleotide 69586 of intron 43 and nucleotide 3038 of intron 44 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a&#x2013;c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). Therefore, we confirmed the DMD genotype of GS&#x394;44.</p>
        <p>Reverse transcription PCR (RT&#x2013;PCR) analysis on RNA from the GS&#x394;44 biopsy and from myocytes derived from primary myoblasts indicated that in addition to the lack of exon 44, a small fraction of transcripts also skipped exon 45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Sequencing of this product confirmed the skipping of exon 45 and the proper fusion between exon 43 and exon 46 (not shown), giving rise to an in-frame transcript coding for a shorter but functional protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Notably, the skipping of exon 45 is currently conceived as a possible approach for the therapeutic treatment of &#x394;44 deletions and for those DMD mutations that through exon 45 skipping could recover the correct reading frame<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. The presence of sub-optimal splice junctions in exon 45 of the <italic>DMD</italic> gene of GS&#x394;44 was excluded by PCR amplification and sequence analysis of the genomic DNA (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Because of the limited ability of <italic>in vitro</italic> propagation of primary myoblasts, fibroblasts derived from the GS&#x394;44 biopsy and <italic>trans-</italic>differentiated with MyoD towards the myogenic lineage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> were also used. These cells produced exon 45 skipping and dystrophin synthesis similarly to differentiated primary myoblasts, even if with a delayed time of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). Notably, two different <italic>trans-</italic>differentiated &#x394;44 DMD myocyte cultures, carrying unrelated deletions around exon 44 (&#x394;44-1 and &#x394;44-2), did not show any detectable exon 45 skipping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>GS&#x394;44 myoblasts lack the Celf2a splicing factor</title>
        <p>RNA-seq experiments, performed on healthy control, GS&#x394;44 and &#x394;44-1 myoblasts and myocytes (deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus, GSE70389), were queried for the abundance of splicing enhancers (SRSF1, SRSF2, SRSF5 and SRSF6) whose potential binding motifs were identified on exon 45 by using the ESE Finder tool (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). This analysis indicated that abundance of such mRNAs did not vary among the different samples; finding that was validated by RT&#x2013;PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). Therefore, none of these factors could be considered a good candidate for the expected phenotype.</p>
        <p>Other possible candidates, among the factors previously known to change during muscle differentiation, were searched. Among them, the CUGBP, Elav-like family member 2 (Celf2) protein was demonstrated to regulate various processes including alternative splicing, editing, RNA stability and translation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> and suggested to participate in dystrophin splicing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. CELF2 is composed of three isoforms differing by their first exon (exons 1a, 1b and 1c)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, that are here termed CELF2a, b and c, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>); moreover, CELF2a has a variant isoform consisting in the alternative use of a 18&#x2009;nt extended exon 11 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Analysis of CELF2 transcripts in the RNA-seq of control, GS&#x394;44 and &#x394;44-1 samples indicated that while the CELF2b and CELF2c isoforms were expressed in all samples, CELF2a was completely absent in GS&#x394;44 both in growth (GM) and differentiation (DM) conditions.</p>
        <p>The absence of CELF2a mRNA, was validated by RT&#x2013;PCR both in the biopsy sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) and in myoblasts (GM) and myocytes (DM) of GS&#x394;44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Notably, all three isoforms were instead present in control and &#x394;44-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Western blot analysis with commercially available antibodies indicated their inability to distinguish between the three different isoforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>); therefore, in following analyses CELF2 isoform expression was always tested at the RNA level.</p>
        <p>When analysing <italic>trans-</italic>differentiated fibroblasts of GS&#x394;44's parents, it was interesting to find that while CELF2a is present in the father, the mother specifically lacks this isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>) and displays skipping of exon 45 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>). In her case, the skipped product is present at very low levels since exclusion of exon 45 would produce an out-of-frame transcript that undergoes degradation through the NMD pathway.</p>
        <p>A 1.3&#x2009;kb DNA sequence upstream the TSS and 200&#x2009;nt of the first exon/intron of <italic>CELF2a</italic> was sequenced in the GS&#x394;44 DNA. We identified only two variants of annotated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (chr10:11046386 T/C, chr10:11047206 C/G of the hg19 human assembly), one of which was laying at the border of a CpG island; neither sequence corresponded to obvious transcriptional factor binding sites as checked on the Encode Transcriptional factors binding tracks at UCSC genome browser and on TransFac database. To check whether methylation could affect CELF2a expression, GS&#x394;44 myoblasts were treated for 7 days with 5-azacytidine in parallel with control myoblasts. No rescue of CELF2a expression was obtained in treated versus untreated GS&#x394;44 cells, suggesting that likely promoter methylation is not the cause of CELF2a lack in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2g</xref>). Also in control cells, 5-azacytidine treatment did not affect CELF2a levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>).</p>
        <p>To detect similar exon skipping events possibly related to the absence of CELF2a, the RNAseq data obtained from control, &#x394;44 and GS&#x394;44 myoblasts and myocytes were analysed by MATS (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Ratios of exon inclusion/skipping were compared in GS&#x394;44 versus &#x394;44-1 and in GS&#x394;44 versus control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). To exclude exon skipping events related to the pathological state or to altered differentiation of DMD cells, we selected only those that were concordant and significant in both GS&#x394;44 versus control and GS&#x394;44 versus &#x394;44-1. Out of 29 genes, correlating with the lack of CELF2a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), five transcripts exhibited alternative splicing events in differentiated myocytes and two of them were experimentally validated, CSDE1 and TMED2. In comparison with control and &#x394;44-1, GS&#x394;44 shows the preferential accumulation of skipped isoforms for both CSDE1 and TMED2 transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2h,i</xref>).</p>
        <p>Four unrelated BMD biopsies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2j</xref>) were then analysed; they all expressed CELF2a and displayed the same CSDE1 and TMED2 isoforms as the control sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). The same isoforms' pattern was also obtained in &#x394;44-1 myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). In contrast, the GS&#x394;44 biopsy and myocytes, besides lacking CELF2a, showed only the skipped isoforms for both CSDE1 and TMED2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e,f</xref>). Notably, while the isoforms present in control and BMD are found in mature muscle fibres (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), those present in GS&#x394;44 correspond to more ubiquitous species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. In fact, comparison of CSDE1 and TMED2 in wild-type (WT) and GS&#x394;44 fibroblasts and myoblasts, indicated that only the unskipped species are the myocyte-specific isoforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2k</xref>). The skipped splicing variants detected in GS&#x394;44 do not have premature stop codons and maintain well-defined protein coding ability even if they are not specific for muscle cells. From these data it cannot be excluded whether any of these changes in isoform ratio could have secondary detrimental effects, even though GS&#x394;44 does not show any adverse effect in any other specific physiological activity.</p>

        <title>Celf2a affects exon 45 splicing</title>
        <p>We next tested whether rescue of Celf2a in GS&#x394;44 could affect exon 45 splicing. A Flag-CELF2a construct (pFlag-CELF2a-1) or an empty vector (pcDNA) were transfected into GS&#x394;44 myoblasts and exon 45 skipping was analysed upon induction of differentiation. Efficient expression of CELF2a was confirmed in GS&#x394;44 myocytes both at the RNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Notably, under these conditions, exon 45 skipping was prevented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The same result was obtained when using a plasmid encoding for the CELF2a variant, lacking the 18&#x2009;nt extension in exon 11 (pCELF2a-2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Interestingly, the overexpression of either forms of CELF2a did not produce any change in the splicing pattern of CSDE1 and TMED2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) indicating that Celf2a has no effect on these two substrates. These results open the interesting question whether CELF2a, together with CSDE1 and TMED2, are on a common pathway perhaps responding to a common upstream effector.</p>
        <p>To further analyse Celf2a splicing activity, &#x394;44-1 myoblasts were infected with a lentiviral construct expressing shRNAs against CELF2a and induced to differentiate for 10 days in the presence of anti-CELF2a LNA GapmeRs. With respect to a 30% decrease of CELF2a, a little amount of exon 45 skipping was observed, indicating again the ability of this factor to impinge specifically on exon 45 splicing in a myogenic environment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>).</p>
        <p>Celf2a activity was also tested on an artificial construct (pLuc45, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>) containing exon 45 and portions of the flanking regions cloned inside the intron of pcDNA3.1-Luc (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). From pLuc45, luciferase can be produced only when exon 45 is skipped. When GS&#x394;44 myoblasts were transfected with pLuc45, a 10-fold increase in luciferase activity with respect to control cells was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). These data indicate that the absence of CELF2a leads to exon 45 skipping also in this artificial construct and that the regions included are sufficient to respond to Celf2a activity. The effects of CELF2a absence were also tested in a cellular context devoid of CELF2a, such as HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). Therefore, pLuc45 was transfected into HeLa cells together with pFlag-CELF2a or with an empty vector as control (pcDNA). The results show that while very little luciferase activity is produced upon ectopic expression of CELF2a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>), in control cells luciferase levels increase by four-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p>
        <p>Finally, to test whether Celf2a interacts with the region containing exon 45, a cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) assay was performed on nuclear RNA from control and GS&#x394;44 myocytes. As a positive control, the region inside intron 10 of the insulin receptor gene (<italic>IR</italic>), previously reported to bind Celf2c (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>), was used. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3e</xref> shows that, in control myocytes (panel CTRL), Celf2 antibodies are able to immunoprecipitate the region containing exon 45 of the dystrophin pre-mRNA (E45) as well as a specific region inside intron 10 of the IR transcript (IR-I10). No interaction was instead detected on regions containing exon 10 (E10) of the dystrophin pre-mRNA or when amplification of the spliced exons 44&#x2013;45 (E44&#x2013;45) region was performed. Notably, when CLIP was performed on GS&#x394;44 myocytes (panel GS&#x394;44), no signal was found on the dystrophin exon 45 containing region, while interaction was detected on intron 10 of the IR transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Since GS&#x394;44 myocytes express only the CELF2b and c isoforms, these results indicate that exon 45 interaction in control cells is specifically due to CELF2a. In conclusion, these data indicate that the Celf2a isoform is able to interact with the dystrophin pre-mRNA at the level of exon 45 and to enhance its inclusion during the splicing reaction.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The exon skipping strategy, as a therapeutic approach for DMD, relies on the concept of converting severe Duchenne phenotypes into milder Becker ones. In line with this, several studies have shown that the disease course of BMD patients with a mutation mimicking a 'skipped' DMD mutation is relatively mild even though BMD individuals display a large range of phenotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, likely reflecting the ability of shorter dystrophin proteins to accomplish only a subset of the different functions of the WT full-length form<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and to be able to produce different amounts of dystrophin. This strong variability stands for individual heterogeneity likely including the specific deletion as well as possible trans-acting factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p>
      <p>Moreover, one of the major concerns about the exon skipping approach resides on how much dystrophin should be required in order to be of therapeutic benefit. Here we show a DMD patient case of a 18-year-old boy, with a &#x394;44 mutation; however, his clinical features, are in net contrast with the common lost of deambulation ability of DMD patients occurring around the first decade of age. Surprisingly, GS&#x394;44 myocytes, through spontaneous exon skipping, produce 7% of dystrophin with respect to control cells, indicating that this amount of dystrophin is enough to alleviate the severity of the disease. Therefore, GS&#x394;44 is an exemplary human case indicating that even very low levels of dystrophin might provide milder dystrophic conditions. GS&#x394;44 presents an intermediate phenotype between a typical DMD patient and a Becker individual, who can be asymptomatic for several decades; in fact, GS&#x394;44 walks independently even if has lost the ability to stand up from the ground. This is in line with the finding that levels of dystrophin slightly higher than those of GS&#x394;44 were found in a large cohort of BMD individuals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and required in mice to slow down or prevent disease progression and improve overall muscle function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.</p>
      <p>By transcriptome analysis of GS&#x394;44 myocytes, we discovered the absence of CELF2a, a specific isoform of the Celf2 splicing factor and we were able to correlate the absence of this product with exon 45 skipping occurring in GS&#x394;44. CELF2 mRNA is expressed at variable levels in BMD/DMD skeletal muscles and its role in splicing regulation was previously suggested<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Celf2 belongs to the CELF/Bruno-like family of RNA-binding proteins that, in mammals, contains six members. This family of highly conserved proteins is involved in regulation of cell-specific and developmentally regulated alternative splicing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The highest expression of CELF2 is found in heart, skeletal muscle and brain and single-nucleotide mutations in this gene have been correlated with a familial form of arrhythmogenic right ventricular<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p>
      <p>Since no mutations were found around the promoter and first exon/intron regions of the GS&#x394;44 <italic>CELF2a</italic> gene, it is likely that the genetic cause for its absence resides on upstream factors regulating its biogenesis or to a still unidentified epigenetic control. As other transcripts appear to be specifically affected in GS&#x394;44 myocytes, it will be interesting to analyse whether they are part of a common regulatory pathway specifically impinging on muscle homeostasis.</p>
      <p>Our data suggest that CELF2a inhibition could represents an interesting new strategy to be considered for improving DMD treatment, at least in those cases where the skipping of exon 45 would result in the recovery of mRNA with an ORF. A relevant challenge for the future would be to design and set up genetic or pharmacological treatments for interfering with Celf2a activity; moreover, these results point to the relevance of studying the genomic milieu of different patients in order to facilitate the clinical development of personalized therapies.</p>

        <title>Case report</title>
        <p>The proband is a 18-year-old boy, the first child of non-consanguineous Italian healthy parents. There was no family history of autoimmune or musculoskeletal disorders in the family. The birth was at term, by caesarean delivery. The baby presented neonatal jaundice treated by phototherapy. The child has never crawled and has acquired independent walking at 18 months. At 1 month of age he presented intolerance to breast milk so he began to take formula. At 7 months he presented an episode of bronchospasm that required hospitalization at the department of pediatrics of the local hospital. During hospitalization, laboratory tests pointed out high levels of transaminases (GOT 797&#x2009;U&#x2009;l<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> and GPT 266&#x2009;U&#x2009;l<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and creatin kinase (12622&#x2009;U&#x2009;l<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). Because this elevation, the family has been addressed at the Cardiomyology and Medical Genetics of Second University of Naples suspecting a muscle disorder, where he arrived at the age of 8 months. At the first control, the baby did not show pseudo-hypertrophy of the calves, but given the high values of the creatin kinase, a blood sample was carried out, with the mother's consent, to perform the molecular analysis of the <italic>dystrophin</italic> gene. The analysis showed the isolated deletion of the exon 44, an out-of-frame mutation consistent with a diagnosis of DMD. Since then, the child underwent regular checks every 6 months, by the same clinical team. Despite the prognosis, the evolution of the disease was very mild, at the age of 5 years the boy was still able to stand up from the floor in 5&#x2009;s, though showing the Gowers manoeuvre, and to climbing stairs without support in 2&#x2009;s. The electrocardiogram showed signs of postero-lateral fibrosis, a picture typical of dystrophinopathic cardiomyopathy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> so that the administration of steroids (Deflazacort &#x2212;0,75&#x2009;mg&#x2009;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> day<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and Ace-inhibitors (Fosinopril 5&#x2009;mg day<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) was started, according to standard protocol.</p>
        <p>At the last control&#x2014;at the age of 18 years&#x2014;the boy walks independently, with a waddling gait, but shows some difficulty in getting up from a chair and climbing stairs. North Star (NSAA) has a value of 8/34 and he was able of walking 252&#x2009;m in 6&#x2009;min (6MWT). The electrocardiogram showed a progression of the fibrosis, while echocardiography showed normal diameters and volumes of cardiac chambers, normal thickness of septum and left posterior wall and a normal ejection fraction. There was a mild reduction of the vital capacity values (FVC 2610, ml, 61%).</p>
