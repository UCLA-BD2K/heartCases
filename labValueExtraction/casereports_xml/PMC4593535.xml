        <p>This article reports orthodontic treatment of a case of hypodontia of five premolars
in an 11-year-old female patient with a positive tooth size-arch length discrepancy
in both dental arches. The patient had a straight profile with balanced facial
growth. Setup manufacture revealed the possibility of achieving ideal occlusion by
mesializing permanent molars up to 15 mm, in addition to keeping a primary molar in
the dental arch. With the aid of absolute anchorage, the proposed mechanics was
performed and the occlusion predicted in the setup was achieved, while profile and
facial growth pattern were maintained. The use of miniscrews for extensive
orthodontic movements was successful. Furthermore, one primary molar was extensively
mesialized. The indication of gingivoplasty to correct gingival smile proved
effective. This is considered a useful technique for orthodontists.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Tooth agenesis is the most common developmental anomaly in humans, often representing a
major clinical problem.<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Congenitally missing
teeth are classified according to the number of missing teeth, except for third molars.
Hypodontia is the term used to describe patients with agenesis of one to five teeth;
however, when six or more teeth are missing, the condition is classified as oligodontia,
whereas anodontia means all teeth are missing.<sup>2,3</sup>
</p>
      <p>The incidence of hypodontia of permanent teeth varies widely, and can be found in 2.6%
to 11.3% in the overall population, while the incidence in primary teeth is considerably
lower.<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Once congenital absence of one primary
tooth occurs, that tooth successor is bound to be missing, given that the germ of the
permanent tooth is formed from the germ of the primary tooth. Oligodontia is a rather
rare condition, affecting about 0.1% to 0.2% of the population. It can occur as the
manifestation of a syndrome or as an isolated condition linked to mutations in the MSX1
and PAX9 genes.<sup>2,3</sup>
</p>
      <p>Hypodontia features a wide range of manifestations. Depending on the number and location
of missing teeth, it can affect esthetics, masticatory function, speech and occlusion
balance, either through unwanted occlusal contacts, extrusion of antagonists, or
inclination of teeth adjacent to the sites of missing teeth.<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Changes in size and shape are also commonly observed in teeth of
patients with hypodontia.<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</p>
      <p>Complexity of hypodontia treatment varies widely, and it is more critical among young,
growing patients whose psychological aspects and facial development are often
compromised, thereby requiring a multidisciplinary approach.<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</p>
      <p>The aim of this article is to report the treatment of a growing patient presenting
gingival smile and five premolars missing, and whose chief complaint was her unfavorable
esthetics due to the size and diastemata of her anterior teeth.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>This clinical case involves a female Caucasian 11-year-old patient who presented for
treatment at private practice. She was referred to orthodontic treatment by a pediatric
dentist who noted hypodontia involving five missing teeth. The patient reported as chief
complaint generalized diastemata; and as secondary complaint, the small size of teeth
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>
<fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Initial orthodontic records.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="2176-9451-dpjo-20-04-00082-gf01"/></fig>
</p>
      <p>The patient was at the beginning of pubertal growth spurt and in mixed dentition. She
still had primary second molars and tooth #14 was missing. Radiographic examination
confirmed that teeth #14, 15, 25, 35 and 45 were also missing, and in primary second
molars, root resorption was not noticeable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig
2</xref>). No family history of hypodontia was reported, nor any signs or symptoms
suggesting temporomandibular disorders.</p>

</p>
      <p>Facial analysis revealed a relatively favorable growth pattern with balanced lower face
dimension, normal nasolabial angle and lip competence, although both upper and lower
lips were retrusive. At smiling, the patient presented with 6 mm of gingival smile, and
reduced cervicoincisal dimension of maxillary canine and incisor crowns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table

      <p>Examination of lateral cephalogram and cephalometric tracing showed that upper and lower
incisors were upright, there was balanced anteroposterior growth of the maxilla and
mandible, with 2 degrees of ANB, as well as balanced vertical growth with 32 degrees of
mandibular plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig 2</xref>).</p>
      <p>The patient also presented with deep overbite, coincident midlines and permanent molars
in Class I relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig 1</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Treatment goals</title>
      <p>Treatment goal was to enhance esthetics and achieve appropriate occlusal function by
eliminating generalized diastemata in both arches; extracting primary second molars,
except for tooth #55; mesializing permanent molars and tooth #55; establishing normal
overbite and Angle Class I relationship with tooth #55 taking the position of tooth #14.
Furthermore, the therapeutic goals were to reduce gingival smile and increase the
cervico-occlusal dimension of maxillary incisors and canines while keeping the axial
inclination of incisors and preserving facial growth pattern and facial profile.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Alternative treatment</title>
      <p>To close the diastemata of incisors and canines, one alternative would be to increase
the size of teeth by means of direct or indirect restorations, considering extensive
oral rehabilitation without the aid of orthodontic treatment. One way to correct the
congenital absence of teeth #14, 15, 25, 35 and 45 would be to keep primary second
molars in the dental arch, maintain the space left by tooth #14, wait for the patient to
stop growing, and then place an implant in the region of tooth #14. Finally, one should
monitor primary second molars in case four more implants were needed in the region of
second maxillary and mandibular premolars.</p>
      <p>Closing the spaces left by missing teeth without the aid of absolute anchorage was not
an option, given that incisor retraction was contraindicated, since incisors exhibited
good axial inclination.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Treatment plan</title>
      <p>Patient's legal guardians opted for treatment with extraction of teeth #65, 75 and 85,
and space closure by molars mesialization. Treatment plan included preadjusted
orthodontic appliance placement followed by alignment and leveling, closure of
diastemata between incisors and canines, four miniscrews placement, molar mesialization
and referral for gingivoplasty.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Treatment progress</title>
      <p>Initially, composite resin stops were fabricated and placed on the occlusal surface of
teeth #36 and 46 to correct overbite and obtain disocclusion, thereby allowing a fixed
orthodontic appliance to be bonded to the lower arch.</p>
      <p>Roth prescription 0.022 x 0.028-in brackets were bonded to incisors, whereas MBT
prescription brackets were bonded to canines, premolars and molars. Molars were banded,
with the exception of tooth #55 which received a standard attachment; and teeth #65, 75
and 85 which did not receive any attachments. After bonding the appliance, alignment and
leveling were performed with 0.014-in nickel-titanium archwires, followed by 0.016-in,
then 0.018-in and 0.020-in stainless steel archwires. When 0.020-in stainless steel
archwires were used, the diastemata between incisors and canines were closed with the
aid of elastomeric chains, so as to allow placement of miniscrews on the distal surface
of canines.</p>
      <p>The periodontist was shown the sites of choice for placement of four miniscrews (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Fig 4</xref>) which were installed concurrently with the
extraction of teeth #65, 75 and 85.</p>
      <p>

occlusal balance required for orthodontic treatment finishing.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="2176-9451-dpjo-20-04-00082-gf03"/></fig>
</p>
      <p>
<fig id="f04" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Photograph depicting four miniscrew placement sites chosen after closure of
diastemata between incisors and canines was achieved.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="2176-9451-dpjo-20-04-00082-gf04"/></fig>
</p>
      <p>A 15-mm mesialization of molars was carried out using elastomeric chains supported on
the miniscrews and by means of applying 200 g of force on each side, with molars sliding
along a 0.020-in stainless steel archwire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig 5</xref>).
The elastics were replaced every four weeks, on average. After closing the remaining
spaces, a pair of 0.019 x 0.025-in rectangular archwires was placed to establish the
correct torques, and dental intercuspation was achieved using intermaxillary elastics
with a vertical component. It took seven months to align and level both dental arches
and close the diastemata between incisors and canines, whereas molar mesialization
spanned 25 months. Moreover, it took four months to finish treatment and establish
balanced occlusal contacts, thereby totaling three years of orthodontic treatment.
Gingivoplasty was performed after total closure of spaces, and before the case was
finished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f06">Fig 6</xref>).</p>

</p>
      <p>A 0.018-in retainer was bonded to the lingual surface of all teeth from #34 to 44. On
the upper dental arch, a retainer of the same gauge was bonded from tooth #11 to 21.
Furthermore, a wraparound removable retainer was installed.</p>
      <p>After treatment completion, an excellent cosmetic effect was achieved thanks to
correction of gingival smile, increased cervico-occlusal dimension of maxillary incisors
and canines, and closure of diastemata. A good functional result was achieved with deep
overbite correction, closure of remaining spaces in the dental arch, molars in Angle
Class I relationship, canines in ideal type I occlusion and coincident midlines.
However, incisor axial inclination was not achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f06">Fig
6</xref>).</p>

    <sec sec-type="discussion">
      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Diagnosis of dental anomalies is usually performed by pediatric dentists, as these
professionals are the first to interact with children and adolescents.<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In the case presented herein, the patient was
enrolled in a half-year prevention program in the private practice of a pediatric
dentist. Tooth agenesis was detected when she was seven years old, after preventive
analysis of panoramic radiograph, and her parents were informed accordingly. The patient
was referred to orthodontic assessment and decided to wait until the final phase of
mixed dentition before allowing orthodontic intervention.</p>
      <p>During diagnosis and planning, patient's chief complaints were addressed. In assessing
patient's vertical growth pattern, it was found that her gingival smile did not stem
from excessive vertical growth of the maxilla. Therefore, she was referred to
periodontal plastic surgery. Studies on smile esthetics show that a gingival smile not
greater than 3 mm is perceived as esthetic by laypeople and dentists alike, whereas a
4-mm gingival smile is not considered esthetic by these groups, which underscores the
need to address this condition in the case presented herein.<sup>7,8</sup>
</p>
      <p>One of the therapeutic options to close anterior diastemata would be to augment
mesiodistal crowns with composite resin on anterior teeth by means of oral
rehabilitation without resorting to orthodontic treatment, which had been proposed by
another professional. However, patient's legal guardians only allowed closure to be
effected orthodontically. The decision to close spaces by means of orthodontic therapy
and not by increasing the size of teeth is more favorable biologically, since it
eliminates the need for periodic replacement of restorations, avoids the risk of
fractures in restorations, while also reducing financial costs.</p>
      <p>In evaluating the alternatives to address congenital missing teeth, the authors chose to
close spaces by means of molar mesialization instead of installing four dental implants.
Such choice was based on the possibility of establishing a balanced occlusion without
the need for implants, which entails a higher relative biological cost; increased
financial costs, given the surgical costs and fabrication of crowns; the need for
periodic replacement of crowns, and mainly because the patient was still growing, which
might hinder a prompt resolution of the case. Auto-transplantation of third molars to
the sites of second premolars was not an option, given that the stage of development of
third molars was not sufficient. Additionally, a mandibular third molar was missing, and
there was the risk of third molar resorption after auto-transplantation.<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</p>
      <p>A diagnostic setup was developed to measure the amount of mesialization required, in
addition to checking the feasibility of attaining occlusal balance by keeping the
maxillary primary second molar in the arch, as both premolars in the right upper
quadrant were missing. Patient's parents were informed about the risk of root resorption
of this primary molar due to the extensive orthodontic movement planned for the case.
This could have eventually resulted in the loss of this tooth and the need to replace it
with an implant after the patient stopped growing. Orthodontic diagnostic setups are
extremely useful tools which aid in planning and performing orthodontic treatment. In
this particular case, the end result was quite similar to the result predicted on the
setup.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p>
      <p>As regards the unusual occlusal relationship of maxillary primary second molar which
occluded with mandibular first permanent molar and mandibular first premolar, the setup
showed that this relationship would allow a balanced occlusion. This was confirmed after
treatment was completed, when a favorable occlusion with balanced distribution of forces
in the vertical, lateral and anteroposterior directions became apparent.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</p>
      <p>Roth prescription was used on incisors with a view to facilitating the incorporation of
palatal and lingual torque in incisors, while the use of MBT prescription on canines and
premolars is justified by the constant need for offsets in mandibular canines when Roth
prescription is used.<sup>12,13</sup> The use of MBT brackets on incisors would also be
indicated for this clinical case.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> It should be noted that the use of preadjusted
appliances is a personal choice and does not directly influence the success of the
mechanics applied, given the constant need for individualization of cases during
treatment finishing, as in the case described herein. Palatal and lingual torque were
applied to upper and lower 0.019 x 0.025-in stainless steel archwires in order to reduce
excessive incisor uprighting, but the results failed to meet expectations. The use of
rectangular archwires, when closing the diastemata between canines and incisors prior to
placing the miniscrews, could have reduced retroclination of maxillary and mandibular
incisors.</p>
      <p>Taking into account patient's good facial profile and good buccopalatal and buccolingual
inclination of incisors, closing spaces by means of incisor retraction was ruled out, as
it could have resulted in loss of lip support, thereby hindering facial esthetics. Thus,
the use of absolute anchorage for molar mesialization was indicated. This absolute
anchorage could be provided either by miniscrews or Bollard miniplates. The choice for
miniscrews prevailed, given that they are easier to install and more
affordable.<sup>14,15</sup>
</p>
      <p>According to Marassi and Marassi,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> mass
retraction requires a force of 150-300 cN on each side (1 Newton = 100 cN = 102 g) which
is equivalent to 150 to 300 g. This level of force is sufficient to close 0.5 to 1 mm
space per month, considering normal alveolar bone height.<sup>15,16</sup> Therefore, a
36-month treatment period was regarded as quite satisfactory, considering that it took
25 months for permanent molars to mesialize 15 mm.</p>
      <p>When miniscrews are used as anchorage during sliding mechanics, super-elastic
nickel-titanium springs, conventional nickel-titanium springs, elastomeric modules and
elastomeric chains can be used.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Although
nickel-titanium springs are recommended due to their lower force variation, the patient
complained of discomfort in the gingiva when the springs were being adapted; thus, the
use of elastomeric chains was preferred.</p>
      <p>Molar mesialization with the aid of elastic chains was preferred, as these afford
continuous force for at least 21 days.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Molar
sliding was achieved by round 0.020-in archwires, since there was no need for torque
control of incisors. Moreover, this archwire produces less friction than a 0.019 x
0.025-in rectangular archwire.</p>
      <p>After treatment, panoramic radiograph revealed good root parallelism of all teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f07">Fig 7</xref>). Excessive uprighting of maxillary and
mandibular incisors was observed in the final cephalometric tracing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f07">Fig 7</xref>). This unfavorable situation may have been due
to closure of anterior diastemata when determining miniscrew sites. The degree of
esthetic commitment caused by the axial inclination of incisors on the face is
debatable, especially considering that patient's chin was significantly augmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f07">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table
1</xref>).</p>

</p>
      <p>A 0.018-in retainer was bonded to the lingual surface of all teeth from #34 to 44 due to
a greater potential for open spaces to relapse, given the vast amount of spaces
remaining in the lower arch. A 0.018-in retainer was bonded to teeth from #11 to 21, and
a removable wraparound plate was installed to maintain the transverse dimension as well
as to close spaces. It is recommended that the lower retainer remain bonded
indefinitely, both to avoid opening spaces and to prevent a decrease in intercanine
width, which results from aging of the occlusion and may cause esthetic impairment. The
patient was instructed to wear the plate for a period of 24 months, during which time
the periodontal ligament could replace its fibers.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>

      <p>Twelve months after removal of appliances, occlusal adjustment was performed by removing
occlusal interference and verifying the absence of fremitus in incisors, thereby
allowing removal of the upper retainer.</p>

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <p>Treatment of hypodontia often requires that osseointegrated dental implants be used to
replace missing teeth. In this clinical case, a conservative proposal was presented for
correction of five missing teeth without the need for implants, with satisfactory
esthetic and functional results.</p>
      <p>The use of miniscrews for extensive orthodontic movement was effective. Furthermore, a
primary molar was satisfactorily mesialized. The indication of gingivoplasty to correct
gingival smile proved effective, and considered a useful technique for
orthodontists.</p>
