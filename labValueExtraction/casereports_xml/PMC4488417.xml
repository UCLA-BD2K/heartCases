        <p>Simultaneous removal of bilateral thyroid tumors was performed while preserving the
parathyroid gland in six dogs. At least one external parathyroid gland was identified in
all dogs. In five cases, the external parathyroid gland and its blood supply were
preserved intact. In one dog, the vessels supplying the external parathyroid gland had
been invaded by the tumor, and the gland was thus removed and reimplanted into the
sternohyoid muscle. That dog required postoperative treatment with oral calcium gluconate
and vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. Local tumor recurrence was not observed in any of the cases.
The mean survival time was 920 days. We found that the external parathyroid gland could be
identified and preserved in most dogs undergoing total thyroidectomy.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Thyroid tumors account for 1.2&#x2013;3.8% of all tumors in dogs [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Carcinomas are more common than
adenomas and represent 90% of thyroid tumors. These tumors typically develop in older dogs;
90% of affected dogs are older than 7 years of age [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Bilateral tumors were reported in as many as 60% of the dogs in one study [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], but another reported bilateral tumors in only 20% of
dogs [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thyroid carcinomas are considered to be
highly malignant, with 16&#x2013;38% of affected dogs reported to have evidence of metastasis in the
regional lymph nodes or lungs at the time of diagnosis [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The median survival time after thyroidectomy is greater than 36 months if the
tumor is freely mobile, and 6&#x2013;12 months if the tumor has invaded the surrounding tissues
[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
    <p>Treatment of canine thyroid carcinoma depends on the size of the mass, the extent of local
invasion, the presence or absence of gross metastatic disease and any clinical signs of
thyrotoxicosis. Surgical excision has the best outcome when tumors are freely mobile and have
not invaded the deeper tissues [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thyroidectomy is generally not recommended for bilateral tumors or
when there is tumor invasion into the adjacent structures, including the blood vessels,
recurrent laryngeal nerves, vagosympathetic trunk, parathyroid glands, and larynx and trachea
[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, successful surgical treatment of bilateral
thyroid tumors has been reported [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
    <p>In dogs, the presence of a thyroid carcinoma usually prevents identification of the
parathyroid gland on the side ipsilateral to the tumor. With bilateral disease, the surgeon
needs to perform a total thyroidectomy and to be prepared to treat the dog for
hypoparathyroidism [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, in humans, techniques
for identification and preservation of the parathyroid gland during total thyroidectomy have
been established [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. There are many reports that
preservation and/or autotransplantation of the parathyroid gland can reduce the incidence of
post-operative hypocalcemia [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, to minimize post-operative complications, an attempt should be
made to identify the parathyroid glands and preserve their blood supply during total
thyroidectomy.</p>
    <p>The most serious post-operative complication of total thyroidectomy without parathyroid
preservation is hypocalcemia. This can be severe and life threatening, and may require
intensive monitoring and care followed by prolonged supplementation with calcium and vitamin
D. In a study of 15 dogs that underwent total thyroidectomy for mobile thyroid gland tumors,
hypocalcemia developed in all nine dogs that underwent complete parathyroidectomies, three of
four dogs that underwent autotransplantation and one of two dogs in which a parathyroid gland
was preserved [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. At the end of the study, seven of
these dogs still required treatment with calcitriol, with or without supplemental calcium.</p>
    <p>There have been reports of surgical treatment of bilateral thyroid tumors in dogs [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but a technique for identification and preservation of
the parathyroid gland in dogs undergoing total thyroidectomy has not been described. The
purpose of this study was to describe the identification and preservation of the parathyroid
gland during total thyroidectomy in dogs, to evaluate surgical outcomes and complications
associated with this procedure and to provide a basis for prognostic assessment.</p>
    <p>The medical records of all dogs diagnosed with bilateral thyroid carcinoma between April 1,
2005 and October 30, 2013 were reviewed. Dogs with freely mobile tumors that were treated by
surgical excision and without evidence of metastasis, were included in the study. Six dogs
with bilateral thyroid carcinoma met the inclusion criteria. The dogs were all beagles and
ranged in age from 5&#x2013;10 years (mean age 8.9 years). Two were intact, and four were spayed
females. All six dogs had two palpable thyroid masses, and one had a cough. None of the dogs
had abnormal regional lymph nodes (including the retropharyngeal, cranial cervical and
mandibular lymph nodes) on palpation or evidence of metastasis on thoracic radiographs.</p>

Tumor/Node Metastasis/Distant Metastasis.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>. Tumor diameters were determined after surgical excision. Tumor volumes were
calculated based on tumor diameters. All cases were staged according to the classification
system of the World Health Organization [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
    <p>Prior to surgery, serum thyroxine concentrations were recorded for three dogs, and serum
calcium concentrations were recorded for all dogs. One dog (case 4) had a high serum thyroxine
concentration (&gt;24.9 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/d<italic>l</italic>, reference range 1.1&#x2013;3.6
<italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/d<italic>l</italic>), but did not have clinical signs of
hyperthyroidism. Another (case 5) had a low serum thyroxine concentration (0.9
<italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/d<italic>l</italic>), but did not have clinical signs of hypothyroidism.
Serum thyroxine concentrations were within normal limits in another dog (case 2), and all of
the dogs had serum calcium concentrations within the normal reference range.</p>
    <p>Thyroidectomy was performed with the patient in dorsal recumbency with a towel under the neck
to slightly elevate it. A ventral midline skin incision was made from the larynx to manubrium.
The sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles were separated using blunt dissection and were
retracted laterally to expose the thyroid tumors. Each external parathyroid gland was
identified as a smooth disc measuring several millimeters in diameter near the cranial pole of
the thyroid capsule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Intraoperative gross appearance of the external parathyroid gland <italic>in

thyroid tumor. (b) The parathyroid gland preserved <italic>in situ</italic> after
excision of the thyroid tumor.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-747-g001"/></fig>). The dark yellow or brownish color of the parathyroid gland differed from the dark red
hue of the thyroid tumor. When the external parathyroid gland was not clearly visible, the
fibrous tissue covering the cranial pole of the thyroid was dissected to facilitate its
identification. To allow preservation of the external parathyroid glands, the tumors were
excised using a modified extracapsular technique [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Each
identified external parathyroid gland was then bluntly dissected from the thyroid capsule
using Metzenbaum scissors and bipolar electrocautery, while the parathyroid branches of the
cranial thyroid artery and vein were preserved. The thyroid artery was ligated downstream of
the origin of the parathyroid branch with 4&#x2013;0 absorbable suture, and other small vessels were
cauterized with bipolar electrocautery. The tissue downstream of the ligature was then
transected, and the thyroid tumor was removed. After thyroidectomy, the musculature was
apposed along the midline using 3&#x2013;0 absorbable suture, and the subcutaneous tissues and skin
were closed routinely. Two dogs developed mild postoperative swelling around the surgical
wound.</p>
    <p>When preservation of the parathyroid vessels was not possible, the parathyroid tissues were
minced into approximately 1-mm cubes and reimplanted into muscle [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A recipient bed was created in one of the sternohyoid muscles by
bluntly dissecting parallel to the muscle fibers, and the minced parathyroid was then
implanted into the muscle belly. The muscle was closed with 4&#x2013;0 absorbable suture.</p>
    <p>The gross appearance of the external parathyroid gland during surgery is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>. In four dogs (cases 1, 3, 4 and 5), only one
external parathyroid gland could be identified, while in the other two dogs (cases 2 and 6),
both external parathyroid glands were located. In one of these (case 2), only the right
external parathyroid gland was preserved as the left cranial thyroid vein had been invaded by
the tumor. In one of the dogs (case 4) in which only one external parathyroid gland was
identified, the vessels supplying the gland had been invaded by the tumor. In this dog, the
parathyroid gland was excised during bilateral extracapsular thyroidectomy and then dissected
free of the thyroid tumor and reimplanted into a recipient bed created in the sternohyoid
muscle.</p>
    <p>The volumes of the thyroid tumors are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table
1</xref>. The mean tumor volume was 17.1 cm<sup>3</sup>. In 8 of 12 tumors, the ipsilateral
external parathyroid gland was identified. In all cases, the external parathyroid gland was
identified on the side of the smaller thyroid tumor.</p>
    <p>Post-operative serum thyroxine concentrations were within the reference range in five dogs
that were treated with oral levothyroxine (5&#x2013;10 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/kg twice daily). One dog
(case 4) had a suspected functional thyroid tumor; in this dog, the serum
thyroxine concentration was greater than normal, and levothyroxine sodium treatment was
discontinued.</p>
    <p>Serum calcium concentrations were measured every 6 hr during the first day after surgery and
then every 12&#x2013;24 hr until discharge from the hospital. In four dogs, the serum calcium
concentrations remained within the reference range (9.0&#x2013;12.0 mg/d<italic>l</italic>) after
surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Serum calcium concentrations in each dog after surgery. The dashed line indicates 9.0
mg/d<italic>l</italic>, which is the lower limit of the reference range.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-747-g002"/></fig>). In the other two dogs (cases 3 and 4), hypocalcemia was detected after surgery; in
one of these (case 3), one external parathyroid gland had been preserved <italic>in
situ</italic>, and in the other (case 4), one external parathyroid gland had been
reimplanted. In the dog with the parathyroid gland preserved <italic>in situ</italic> (case
3), the hypocalcemia was mild, and no treatment was required. In the dog with the reimplanted
parathyroid gland (case 4), the serum calcium concentration was 8.3 mg/d<italic>l</italic> at
26 hr after surgery, and treatment with oral calcium gluconate (125 mg twice a day) and oral
alfacalcidol (0.005 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/kg once a day) was initiated. Forty-one days after
surgery, the calcium gluconate treatment was discontinued. One hundred and ten days after
surgery, the oral alfacalcidol was discontinued, because the serum calcium concentration
remained stable.</p>
    <p>The condition for being discharged from the hospital was that their serum calcium
concentration remained stable for more than 36 hr. Although case 3 was mildly hypocalcemic at
44 hr after surgery, this dog was discharged 68 hr postoperatively because the hypocalcemia
resolved without treatment. Discharge from hospital was on post-operative day 3 (case 6), day
4 (cases 1 and 2), day 5 (case 5) or day 6 (cases 3 and 4), and the mean duration of the
hospital stay was 3.7 days.</p>
    <p>All tumors were histologically confirmed to be thyroid follicular cell carcinomas and had
locally invaded the blood vessels and thyroid capsule. The surgical margins were infiltrated
by tumor cells in two cases (cases 2 and 3). Adjuvant radiation therapy was recommended for
these cases, and case 3 received radiation therapy (32 Gy in total; 4 Gy fractions over 4
weeks).</p>
    <p>Five dogs were still alive at their last follow-up examination (274, 789, 929, 1,280 and
1,769 days after surgery). Pulmonary metastasis occurred in one dog (case 3) and resulted in
death at 477 days after surgery. In the dog with hyperthyroidism (case 4), local recurrence or
distant metastases were suspected, but not identified at the final follow-up examination. In
the remaining four dogs, no local recurrence or distant metastases were detected at the final
follow-up examination. Median survival time was estimated using the Kaplan&#x2013;Meier method, but
the median survival time was not reached. The mean survival time was 920 days.</p>
    <p>The parathyroid gland has generally been considered difficult to identify in dogs with
thyroid carcinoma [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Because the blood supply to the
external parathyroid gland might be compromised by the thyroid tumor, detection of the
external parathyroid gland on the side ipsilateral to the tumor may be difficult [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, we found that at least one external parathyroid
gland could be identified in all of the dogs in our study. The external parathyroid gland was
identified as a smooth disc measuring several millimeters in diameter near the cranial pole of
the thyroid capsule. In a recent report describing total thyroidectomy in 15 dogs with
bilateral thyroid tumors, the external parathyroid gland was not preserved in nine of the
cases [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, none of the dogs in our study
required total parathyroidectomy.</p>
    <p>Acute hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism after total parathyroidectomy may be life
threatening [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Dogs with acute hypocalcemia should be treated
with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> and calcium immediately after surgery. In the present study, all
five dogs in which an external parathyroid gland was preserved without reimplantation did not
require treatment for hypocalcemia. Only one of the dogs required parathyroid reimplantation;
this dog experienced postoperative hypocalcemia, which eventually resolved with treatment. In
a study of 15 dogs that underwent total thyroidectomy, three of four dogs that underwent
reimplantation of an external parathyroid gland required treatment for hypocalcemia [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These results suggest that the external parathyroid
gland should be preserved <italic>in situ</italic> when possible to minimize the likelihood of
hypocalcemia during the postoperative period.</p>
    <p>In a study of cats that underwent reimplantation of an external parathyroid gland after
bilateral thyroidectomy, serum calcium concentrations fell below the normal range within 24 hr
after surgery and, in most cases, returned to normal within 20 days [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It was presumed that the normalization of serum calcium concentrations
in these cases likely resulted from revascularization of the parathyroid graft. This suggests
that the dog that underwent parathyroid reimplantation in our study regained the ability to
maintain normal serum calcium concentrations because of revascularization of the parathyroid
graft. The dog received 110 days of treatment for hypocalcemia, because the medication was
gradually decreased over a long period of time.</p>
    <p>The textbooks suggest that attempts to salvage the parathyroid glands may cause inadvertent
seeding of tumor cells at the surgical site [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>];
however, no local recurrence was detected at the final follow-up examinations in any of our
cases. Previous studies have also not reported an increased rate of local recurrence
associated with extracapsular excision of mobile canine thyroid tumors [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thus, the risk of seeding
may be reduced, if careful extracapsular excision is performed.</p>
    <p>A median survival time was not reached in our study, but the mean survival time of 920 days
is similar to a previously reported survival time [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].
In one study, the median survival time was 7 months, and 47% of dogs that underwent surgical
treatment for thyroid carcinoma died within 2 years after surgery from causes related to
primary tumor regrowth or metastasis [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Another study
reported that the median survival time for dogs that underwent unilateral or bilateral
thyroidectomy was more than 36 months, and no cases of local recurrence were observed [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In a recent study of bilaterally thyroidectomized
dogs, the median survival time after surgery was 38 months, and there were no cases of local
recurrence [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These results suggest that local
control is important in dogs with thyroid tumors. The long survival times and lack of local
recurrence seen in the cases that we describe here suggest that the precise preservation of
the external parathyroid gland, while maintaining an intact thyroid capsule does not influence
local tumor control.</p>
    <p>In this study, we found that at least one external parathyroid gland could be identified and
preserved in most dogs undergoing total thyroidectomy. This procedure appears to be safe and
effective, and reduces the complications associated with the surgical treatment of bilateral
thyroid carcinoma in dogs. However, this study only included a small number of cases and the
median survival time was not reached, and thus, additional studies should further assess the
safety and effectiveness of this technique.</p>
