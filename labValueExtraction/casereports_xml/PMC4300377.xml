        <p>A male Thoroughbred fetus was
aborted on day 251 of pregnancy. Gross and histological examinations detected systemic
granulomatous lesions in many superficial and visceral lymph nodes and organs including
the liver, tonsils, lungs, thymus, spleen, right thyroid gland and gastrointestinal tract,
and suppurative placentitis, pyogranulomatous amnionitis and intralesional acid-fast
bacilli were also detected. An examination of the DNA base sequence of the &#x3B2; subunit of
RNA polymerase demonstrated that <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> strain 104 had
infected several organs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of equine
fetal mycobacterial infection in Japan.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Mycobacteria are aerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria that are capable
of causing granulomatous inflammation in a wide range of animals [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Bacteria belonging to the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>
complex (MTC) are called typical mycobacteria and cause tuberculosis. Conversely, diseases
caused by bacteria that are not the members of the MTC; i.e., atypical mycobacteria, are
referred to as mycobacterioses or atypical mycobacterioses [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In horses,
<italic>Mycobacterium</italic> (<italic>M.) tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M.
bovis</italic> produce tuberculosis, and atypical mycobacteria including those belonging to
the <italic>M. avium</italic> complex (MAC) have been reported to cause mycobacteriosis [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, mycobacterial infections rarely occur in
horses, even in places where the disease exhibits a high incidence among other animal species;
therefore, horses are considered to be naturally highly resistant to mycobacterial infection
[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In equine cases of mycobacterial infection,
lesions usually form in the intestinal tract and the associated lymph nodes, and hematogenous
or lymphatic spread can occur to the liver, spleen, lungs and other lymph nodes [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Miliary
lesions are predominantly seen in the lungs of advanced cases [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The clinical signs of equine mycobacterial infection depend on the extent to
which the animal&#x2019;s organs have been affected. The most frequent complaints are chronic weight
loss, weakness and lethargy. In addition, horses can also present with pyrexia, coughing and
respiratory distress due to the development of pulmonary lesions [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
    <p>Equine abortions associated with fetal mycobacterial infection are uncommon. In the English
literature, only 4 cases have been reported; i.e., 2 cases of <italic>M. avium</italic>
complex infection in North America [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], a case of <italic>M. terrae</italic> infection in
Australia [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and a case of infection by a novel type
of mycobacteria in North America [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In Japan, there
has only been one reported case of equine mycobacteriosis, in which granulomatous pneumonia
developed in an adult horse [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In this paper, we
describe the first case of equine abortion with mycobacterial infection of the fetus and
placenta in Japan.</p>
    <p>A 9-year-old Thoroughbred mare aborted a male fetus on day 251 of gestation. This was the
mare&#x2019;s 5th pregnancy and her first abortion. The mare was imported from the United States
about 15 months before the abortion and was pregnant at the time. She had already delivered a
healthy filly in Japan. A routine hormone test performed on day 213 of gestation revealed a
high serum progesterone level, and further increases were seen on days 226 and 235. A
decreased serum estrogen level was also detected on day 235 of gestation. Based on these
results, placentitis was suspected, and antibiotic therapy was started. On day 241 of
gestation, abdominal swelling was noticed. In an ultrasonographic examination, it was
difficult to measure the combined thickness of the uterus and placenta, and this was
attributed to a high intrauterine pressure caused by an increased amount of amniotic fluid
[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The mare began to show signs of labor from day
246 of gestation, and the administration of a uterine relaxant was started. The mare aborted a
male fetus 5 days later. Samples from the chorionic surface of the placenta that were obtained
at the abortion were submitted for bacteriological examination in a commercial laboratory. The
specimens were aerobically cultured for 18 to 24 hr at 35&#xB0;C on blood, chocolate or MacConkey
agar medium, and <italic>Enterobacter agglomerans</italic> was isolated. The aborted fetus and
fetal membranes were submitted for gross and histological examinations.</p>
    <p>The aborted fetus exhibited a crown-rump length of 47 cm and weighed 10 kg. The fetus
presented with growth insufficiency and was emaciated, and a white viscous substance adhered
to its external surface. Enlarged superficial and visceral lymph nodes were seen throughout
its body, including the axillary, inguinal, mediastinal, bronchial, intercostal, hepatic,
splenic, gastric, mesenteric and colonic lymph nodes. The cranial mesenteric lymph nodes were
most severely affected and measured approximately 9 &#xD7; 4 &#xD7; 4 cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Gross photograph of the fetus&#x2019; intestinal tract and the associated lymph nodes. The
cranial mesenteric lymph nodes are markedly enlarged (arrowhead). Bar=10 cm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1617-g001"/></fig>). Cut sections revealed the multinodular proliferation of homogenous light-tan tissue
with occasional central yellowish-white foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig.
2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Cut surface of a cranial mesenteric lymph node. The lymph node is enlarged and has been
replaced with homogenous light-tan tissue and occasional central necrosis (arrowhead).
Bar=1 cm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1617-g002"/></fig>). The liver was diffusely yellowish in color and slightly swollen. About half of the
caudate lobe of the liver had been replaced with an aggregate of small yellowish-white
nodules, which measured up to 3 mm in diameter. The tonsils were enlarged and exhibited an
irregularly roughened surface. White nodules, which measured up to 5 mm in diameter, were
scattered throughout the lungs, thymus, spleen and right thyroid gland. The intestinal mucosa
was diffusely roughened from the jejunum to the colon, and many minute white nodules were
evident in the wall on cut sections. The lungs displayed diffuse atelectasis.</p>
    <p>In the placenta, the cervical star exhibited a birth tear. In addition, the placenta had
thickened slightly due to edema, and the chorionic surface was diffusely congestive and
covered with a sanguineous exudate containing necrotic debris. The allantoamnion was diffusely
edematous, and numerous raised yellow plaques, which measured up to 1 cm in diameter and in
some cases had fused together, were distributed across the surface of the amnion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Gross photograph of the surface of the amnion. Multifocal to coalescing, raised yellow
plaques are distributed across the surface of the amnion. Bar=2 cm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1617-g003"/></fig>). The collected tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded in
paraffin, cut into 4 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>m-thick sections and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin. Selected sections were subjected to Gram and Ziehl-Neelsen staining.</p>
    <p>Histologically, most of the normal lymph node tissue had been replaced by diffuse
granulomatous lesions composed of many epithelioid macrophages, scattered neutrophils and
multinucleated giant cells intermingled with proliferative fibrous tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_004" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>The cranial mesenteric lymph node has been replaced by a diffuse granulomatous lesion
containing necrotic foci (N). HE. Bar=500 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1617-g004"/></fig>). The multifocal accumulation of neutrophils, which had become necrotic, and a coagulum
of nuclear and cytoplasmic debris were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig.
4</xref>). The lesions displayed a sarcomatous appearance as described previously in equine
mycobacterial infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_005">Fig. 5</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_005" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>Higher magnification image of the granulomatous lesion in the cranial mesenteric lymph

of concentrically arranged cells [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The cytoplasm of
the macrophages and multinucleated giant cells within these lesions exhibited a fine granular
appearance. In addition to the lymph nodes that had grossly enlarged, the superficial
cervical, medial and lateral retropharyngeal, renal, medial iliac and iliofemoral lymph nodes
also exhibited lesions. The grossly observed small nodules in the caudate lobe of the liver
were granulomas, which were frequently accompanied by central necrosis. The hepatocytes
displayed diffuse fatty changes, and small foci of granulomatous inflammation were found in
the portal regions of the remaining lobes. Similar granulomatous lesions had also formed in
the tonsils, lungs, thymus, spleen and right thyroid gland, which corresponded to the small
white nodules observed during the gross examination. Multifocal or diffuse granulomatous
proliferation was seen in the lamina propria and submucosa from the stomach to the right
dorsal colon. The chorionic surface of the allantochorion was diffusely covered with an
abundant proteinaceous exudate containing degenerative neutrophils with a scattered or focal
distribution and colonies of Gram-positive bacilli. In addition, neutrophils had accumulated
multifocally in the villous stroma, and the chorioallantoic stroma was edematous. Squamous
metaplasia of the chorionic epithelium was also observed. Severe lesions were present
throughout an extensive area from the cervix to the body of the chorion. In the amnion,
neutrophils had accumulated to form multiple abscesses and were also found in the regions
around blood vessels. Epithelioid macrophages and multinucleated giant cells were scattered
around the abscesses and among the infiltrating neutrophils. Ziehl-Neelsen staining detected
numerous acid-fast bacilli within the intralesional phagocytes in the liver, tonsils, lungs,
thymus, spleen, jejunum, ileum, colons and superficial cervical, axillary, inguinal,
mediastinal, gastric and mesenteric lymph nodes in the fetus and amnion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_005">Fig. 5</xref>, inset), which were only weakly stained by Gram staining.
Acid-fast bacilli were also scattered in the necrotic foci. The Gram-positive bacilli in the
chorionic exudate exhibited intense acid-fast reactions. Acid-fast bacilli that had adhered to
the fetus&#x2019; skin were also observed.</p>
    <p>Cryopreserved specimens of the thymus, lungs, liver, spleen, cranial mesenteric lymph nodes,
allantochorion and allantoamnion that were obtained during necropsy were subjected to
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis to identify the acid-fast organisms. DNA was
extracted from the samples using a DNA isolation kit (MagNA Pure LC DNA Isolation Kit I,
Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and was then analyzed by PCR targeting the gene encoding the &#x3B2;
subunit of RNA polymerase (<italic>rpoB</italic>) (primers: MF, 5&#x2032;CGACCACTTCGGCAACCG3&#x2032;; MR,
5&#x2032;TCGATCGGGCACATCCGG3&#x2032;), as described previously [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].
The resultant PCR product was approximately 350 base pairs in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_006">Fig. 6</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_006" position="float"><label>Fig. 6.</label><caption><p>PCR analysis targeting the <italic>rpo&#x3B2;</italic> gene. M: 100 bp DNA ladder, lanes 1&#x2013;5:

chorion, respectively. All PCR products are approximately 350 base pairs in length.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1617-g006"/></fig>), and its nucleotide sequence was analyzed in a commercial laboratory (Macrogen Japan
Corp., Tokyo, Japan). A BLAST search detected 100% homology between the PCR product and the
<italic>M. avium</italic> strain 104 (<italic>M. avium</italic> 104) published in GenBank
(accession numbers NC008595 and CP000479). Blood and fecal specimens from the mare, which were
obtained at 8 and 17 months after the abortion, respectively, were also subjected to PCR
analysis using the same method. No specific DNA of mycobacterial organisms was detected in
these specimens.</p>
    <p>Based on these findings, the case was etiologically diagnosed as fetal systemic
mycobacteriosis and mycobacterial placentitis due to <italic>M. avium</italic> 104 infection.
The fetus had systemic lesions histologically characterized by granulomatous inflammation with
intralesional acid-fast bacilli. The fetal membranes exhibited diffuse, severe suppurative
chorionitis and pyogranulomatous amnionitis, and intralesional acid-fast bacilli were detected
on them.</p>
    <p>In Japan, there has only been one case report about equine mycobacterial infection, which
involved granulomatous pneumonia in an adult horse. Bacteria belonging to the MAC were
isolated from the case [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. <italic>M. avium</italic>
104, which was detected in our specimens, is also a member of the MAC and was previously
demonstrated to be identical to a strain of <italic>M. avium</italic> subsp.
<italic>hominissuis</italic> (MAH) based on an examination of the sequence of its
<italic>hsp65</italic> gene [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. MAH infection is
often detected in pigs and humans in Japan [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], as well
as in other countries [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and has been described in
adult horses, but not in equine fetuses [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although
MAC species have been identified as causative agents in two equine cases of fetal
mycobacterial infection [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], this is the first report about a case in which MAH infection resulted in
fetal mycobacteriosis and abortion. The present case indicates that it is possible for
mycobacterial organisms to be transmitted from infected horses, their environments and/or
equine veterinary facilities. The risk assessment is needed against mycobacterial infection in
persons working in the horse industry.</p>
    <p>Three infectious routes have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of placentitis
in horses: ascending infection from the posterior genital tract by way of the cervix,
hematogenous infection from the maternal bloodstream and local spread from infectious foci
derived from deep-seated endometritis [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the
current case, the presence of acid-fast bacilli in the exudate found on the chorionic surface
indicated that the bacteria might have entered the uterus via the cervix. Furthermore,
bacterial invasion of the chorionic surface and subsequent hematogenous spread might have
caused the fetus&#x2019; systemic infection. The adherence of acid-fast bacilli to the fetal skin
indicated that the bacilli were present in the amniotic fluid, and a peroral infection might
subsequently have occurred. Suppurative chorionitis was also observed in the previous cases of
fetal equine mycobacteriosis [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Superinfection by <italic>Enterobacter agglomerans</italic> or other
undetected bacteria might have modified the chorionic lesion and played a role in the
subsequent abortion. The fact that mycobacteria were not isolated from the specimen collected
in the present case suggests that a specific culture method might be needed for isolating
mycobacteria [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
    <p>In the 4 previously reported cases of fetal mycobacterial infection involving aborted horse
fetuses, the fetuses were aborted on days 160, 180, 255 (8 1/2 months) and 300 of gestation,
respectively [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In one of these cases, a Standardbred fetus that was delivered on day 160 of
gestation had numerous non-caseating granulomas in its small intestine, splenic lymph nodes,
lungs, liver, amnion and allantochorion, which were only detected during microscopic
examinations [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, an American Quarter Horse
that was aborted on day 180 of gestation did not have any significant granulomatous lesions
[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, an 8 1/2-month-old Thoroughbred
fetus did not exhibit any gross lesions, but histiocytic bronchopneumonia involving
intralesional acid-fast bacilli was detected microscopically [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Finally, a Standardbred fetus that was aborted on day 300 of gestation had
non-caseating granulomas in its liver; suppurative pneumonia, in which intraalveolar
multinucleated giant cells were found to have engulfed aspirated materials; and extensive
suppurative placentitis [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Compared to these cases,
the present case, in which the fetus was aborted on day 251 of gestation, involved more severe
and extensive lesions, which affected the fetus&#x2019; lymph nodes and organs. The degree and
distribution of mycobacterial lesions are considered to be influenced by various bacterial
parameters, such as the quantity and virulence of the causative bacteria [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The immunological status of the host is also considered
to play a key role in the development of lesions in human MAC infections [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In human cases of pulmonary and disseminated MAC
disease, <italic>M. avium</italic> 104 was frequently detected in the lesions of
immunocompromised hosts [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this case, although
the virulence of the isolated mycobacterium was not determined, the destruction of lymphoid
tissue might have adversely affected the immunological status of the fetus, leading to a
vicious circle of disease expansion.</p>
