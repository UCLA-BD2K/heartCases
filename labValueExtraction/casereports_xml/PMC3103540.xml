          <p>Two subjects of a non-consanguineous Caucasian family were studied. The 46,XX phenotypic normal female was diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency at the age of 10 months, had normal pubertal development and still has no signs of hypergonodatropic hypogonadism at 32 years of age. Her 46,XY brother was born with normal male external genitalia and was diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency at 14 months. Puberty was normal and no signs of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism are present at 29 years of age.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>StAR gene analysis revealed two novel compound heterozygote mutations T44HfsX3 and G221S. T44HfsX3 is a loss-of-function StAR mutation. G221S retains partial activity (&#x223C;30%) and is therefore responsible for a milder, non-classic phenotype. G221S is located in the cholesterol binding pocket and seems to alter binding/release of cholesterol.</p>

          <p>StAR mutations located in the cholesterol binding pocket (V187M, R188C, R192C, G221D/S) seem to cause non-classic lipoid CAH. Accuracy of genotype-phenotype prediction by <italic>in vitro</italic> testing may vary with the assays employed.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mutations in the <italic>StAR</italic> gene were first described in patients with classic congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia (CLAH) in which both the adrenals and the gonads seemed to completely lack steroidogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Lin1">[1]</xref>. The underlying pathophysiology of CLAH is explained by the defective transport of cholesterol needed for the biosynthesis of steroids, to the inner mitochondrial membrane, and the cytoplasmic accumulation of lipid droplets which would fatally harm the cells of the steroidogenic tissues over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Bose1">[2]</xref>. So far, patients described as having the recently described non-classic form of lipoid adrenal hyperplasia (NCLAH) presented with adrenal insufficiency in early infancy or later and, while manifesting with hypocortisolism, had inconsistent signs of mineralocorticoid deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Baker1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Metherell1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Sahakitrungruang1">[5]</xref>, thus resembling the clinical profile of familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD). FGD has been described as a syndrome secondary to ACTH resistance, and inactivating mutations in the gene encoding melanocortin type 2 receptor (<italic>MC2R</italic>) were the first to be associated with FGD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Cooray1">[6]</xref>. However, only &#x223C;25% of such patients were found to be the carriers of <italic>MC2R</italic> mutations and have been classified as type 1 FGD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Chan1">[7]</xref>. A second genetic cause of FGD was identified in 15&#x2013;20% of patients resulting from defects in the MC2R receptor accessory protein (<italic>MRAP</italic>) (FGD type 2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Chan1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Metherell2">[8]</xref>. In the remaining 55% of patients with a FGD syndrome, no mutations in either <italic>MC2R</italic> or <italic>MRAP</italic> genes were found. Large family association studies delimited a region on chromosome 8q12.1&#x2013;q21.2 that was associated with the FGD syndrome in several families (FGD type 3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Genin1">[9]</xref>. The <italic>StAR</italic> gene maps to the gene locus 8p11.2 and has been identified only recently as causing non-classic lipoid adrenal hyperplasia in a first series of patients in 5 families <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Metherell1">[4]</xref>. In contrast to CLAH which leads to a complete undervirilization/feminization of the external genitalia in 46,XY subjects at birth, most 46,XY patients with the NCLAH seem to have a normal gonadal function during their fetal life and therefore have normal male genitalia at birth or show only minimal anomalies such as cryptorchidism or hypospadias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Baker1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Metherell1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Sahakitrungruang1">[5]</xref>. However, some patients that were followed to adulthood showed a progressive decline in the gonadal functions over time, as demonstrated by decreasing plasma testosterone, high gonadotropins and abnormal spermiogram <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Metherell1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To better understand whether a StAR mutation will lead to the severe form of CLAH or whether it will manifest as NCLAH mimicking a FGD syndrome, further patients need to be studied and followed as they age. On the other hand, patients manifesting with a FGD syndrome who do not have mutations in the genes for <italic>MC2R</italic> and <italic>MRAP</italic> should be genetically investigated for <italic>StAR</italic> mutations.</p>
      <p>In this report, we have studied a series of 7 patients (6 families) who had the clinical and biochemical diagnosis of congenital isolated glucocorticoid deficiency, for possible genetic defects. The <italic>MC2R</italic> gene analysis revealed a novel homozygous MC2R mutation (K289fs) in one patient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Hirsch1">[10]</xref>. The <italic>MRAP</italic> gene sequencing showed a normal sequence in all 7 patients. The <italic>StAR</italic> gene analysis revealed two novel mutations (T44HfsX3 and G221S) present in compound heterozygote form in two siblings. Here we are describing the clinical, genetic and functional characteristics of these novel StAR mutations.</p>

          <title>Patient 1</title>
          <p>A Caucasian phenotypically normal female was the first child of non-consanguineous parents, born in 1978 after an uneventful pregnancy and a normal neonatal period. At 10 months of age, she experienced an episode of dehydration and hypoglycemia accompanied by skin hyperpigmentation: blood glucose 23 mg/dl (1.27 mmol/L), plasma sodium 127 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, urea 75 mg/dL (12.4 mmol/L). Fifteen days later she suffered a similar episode. The cortisol levels did not respond to stimulation with ACTH [250 &#xB5;g perfused over 4 h, followed by 250 &#xB5;g IM/12 h for the following 2 days]: baseline 2.3 &#xB5;g/dL (63.4 nmol/L) followed by 3.7 &#xB5;g/dL (102.1 nmol/L) at 15 h, 1.9 &#xB5;g/dL (52.4 nmol/L) at 24 h, 2.1 &#xB5;g/dL (57.9 nmol/L) at 48 h and 1.4 &#xB5;g/dL (38.6 nmol/L) at 72 h. The ACTH was not measured and baseline plasma renin activity was 22 ng/mL/h (28.5 nmol/L/h; normal range: 1.1&#x2013;22.9 ng/mL/h). Karyotype was 46,XX. She was diagnosed with congenital adrenal hyperplasia and was treated with hydrocortisone (18&#x2013;20 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d) and fludrocortisone (50 &#xB5;g/d); doses were adjusted during childhood and puberty according to the growth and the renin activity control. Pubertal development started at 12 years of age, menarche presented at 14 years, total pubertal growth gain was 14 cm and a final height of 143 cm was reached at the age of 16 years (midparental height 147.2 cm). Currently, at the age of 32 years, she is doing fine on hydrocortisone (10 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d) and fludrocortisone (50 &#xB5;g/d) replacement treatment, has regular menses and normal serum gonadotropin concentrations at early follicular phase (LH 2.6 IU/L and FSH 4.2 IU/L); the ACTH is un-measurable.</p>

          <title>Patient 2</title>
          <p>The younger brother of patient 1, was born in 1981 after an uneventful pregnancy. He had normal male genitalia and descended testes. At 3 weeks of life, a Synacthen&#xAE; (250 &#xB5;g/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> iv) test showed a normal cortisol response: baseline 2.5 &#xB5;g/dL (68.9 nmol/L) and peak 19.5 &#xB5;g/dL (538.0 nmol/L). However, at 14 months of age he presented with hypoglycemic episodes and skin hyperpigmentation. ACTH was elevated [&gt;1250 pg/mL (&gt;275 pmol/L)], cortisol did not respond to ACTH stimulation [basal 3.1 &#xB5;g/dL (85.5 nmol/L); peak 3.4 &#xB5;g/dL (93.8 nmol/L)] and plasma renin activity was normal [4.2 ng/mL/h (5.4 nmol/L/h)]. He was treated with hydrocortisone (16&#x2013;18 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d) and fludrocortisone (50 &#xB5;g/d) during childhood and puberty. Puberty started at 11.5 years of age, hydrocortisone dose was adjusted to 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d to improve growth, total pubertal growth gain was 31 cm and he reached a final height of 159.3 cm (midparental height 160.7 cm). At 17 years of age, fludrocortisone therapy was stopped and plasma renin activity remained normal thereafter. Presently, at the age of 29 years, he is fine on only hydrocortisone therapy. Bilateral testicular volume is 25 mL. Serum testosterone is 669 ng/dL (23.1 nmol/L; normal range 262&#x2013;1600 ng/dL), LH 7.3 IU/L (normal range 0.8&#x2013;8.0), FSH 7.2 IU/L (normal range 0.7&#x2013;12.0), inhibin B 138.2 pg/mL (normal range 107&#x2013;322 pg/mL), androstendione 150 ng/dL (5.2 nM/L; normal range 70&#x2013;250 ng/dL), DHEA &lt;70 ng/dL (&lt;2.4 nmol/L; normal range 400&#x2013;800 ng/dL); DHEA-S &lt;15 &#xB5;g/dL (&lt;384 nmol/L; normal range 60&#x2013;410 &#xB5;g/dL); ACTH is 12 pg/mL (2.6 pmol/L) under cortisol replacement therapy.</p>

        <title>Structural model of StAR</title>
        <p>We performed a PhiBlast search of PDB database with the amino acid sequence of human StAR. A custom position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) was created based on initial runs of the Phi-BLAST and after five rounds of search optimizations, the human StAR related lipid transfer domain of MLN64 (PDB # <bold>1EM2</bold>) and StAR related lipid transfer 5 (PDB # 2R55) structures were chosen as template based on structure quality and coverage of human StAR sequence. A secondary structure prediction of the human StAR sequence was performed to start the initial alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020178-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Amino acids 62 to 285 of the human StAR molecule were aligned with template structures to generate structural alignments of two molecules and fed into the YASARA and WHATIF programs for building of models. Some of the loop sequences were modelled separately by scanning loop database library. In the final model of StAR a total of 6 loops were modelled (LLGSRLEETL, QQDNGD, RMEAMG, VPDV, GSP, HPASEARC). Quality control analysis revealed 98.7% of residues in favoured regions and 100% residues in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Our StAR model was close to MLN64 in terms of core structural features and was also in agreement with previously described models of StAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020178-g003">Figure 3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Mathieu1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Murcia1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Yaworsky1">[28]</xref>. These previous models of StAR have also been based on MLN64 structure which was used as a template in our model building, and therefore, based on reported features, our model was quite similar in overall fold and geometry as compared to previous reports, and had similar steroid binding pocket, preserving core salt bridges between E169 and R188 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Mathieu1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Murcia1">[27]</xref>.

        <title>Structural changes caused by the G221S mutation</title>
        <p>To study the effect of the novel and some known StAR mutations, we performed computational mutagenesis of our structural model of StAR. To explore the role of mutations in binding and release of cholesterol by StAR, a docking of cholesterol into the StAR structure was performed and used to calculate the interactions with neighbouring amino acids forming the cholesterol binding pocket. Several hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of cholesterol and side chains of amino acids forming the cavity holding the cholesterol seem to form during entry and exit of cholesterol. In our simulation, E169, R188, H220, T223 and S244 located on the beta sheets of the cholesterol binding cavity next to helix 3 were found to be involved in the interactions with cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020178-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition, other potential interaction partners of cholesterol were N150 L260 and T263. In previous studies mutations of E169, R188 and L260 (E168 and R187 in case of hamster StAR) have been reported to result in loss of cholesterol transfer activity of StAR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Bose1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Baker1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Sahakitrungruang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Mathieu1">[26]</xref>. Among these core residues, R188 forms salt bridges with E169 and H220, and two hydrogen bonds with E169, one of which was not found in G221S-StAR, although all salt bridges were intact. A slight but significant shift in the core binding site upon G221S mutation was observed due to disruption of G221&#x2013;S244 hydrogen bond which seems to cause change in conformation of H220 side chain and disrupt interaction of H220 with cholesterol in the S221-StAR compared to WT-StAR as revealed by all atom contact analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020178-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). This change is likely to have resulted from additional contacts of S221 with V116 which are absent in WT StAR.</p>

        <title>Entry and exit of cholesterol in StAR</title>
        <p>Potential routes of cholesterol entry and exit were also evaluated to fully understand the role of StAR mutation (G221S) described in this study. After docking of cholesterol into StAR, we performed a steered molecular dynamic simulation, where a constant force on cholesterol molecule was applied during simulation. We observed considerable movement of the loop formed by residues A174&#x2013;L178 of StAR, but not of the C-terminus helix during the exit of cholesterol bound to StAR. An earlier report using the forced disulfide bond formation has indicated flexibility of C-terminus helix based on cholesterol binding studies with WT and structurally constrained StAR proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Baker2">[29]</xref>. Another recent computational molecular dynamic simulation study on binding and exit of cholesterol from StAR found movement of the A174&#x2013;L178 loop but not the C-terminus helix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Murcia1">[27]</xref>, suggesting a possible rigid nature of the C-terminus helix. However, structures of both WT and structurally constrained StAR proteins reported by Baker et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Baker2">[29]</xref> need to be solved to resolve the issue whether loss of cholesterol binding was due to putting constraints on C-terminus helix or by the subtle structural changes caused by the restraints created by artificially introduced disulfide bonds as suggested by Murcia et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Murcia1">[27]</xref>. Additional studies involving mutagenesis of amino acids in the loop formed by AA174&#x2013;178 of StAR will also be required to investigate the potential mechanisms of cholesterol binding. We also observed interaction of cholesterol with R188 and T223 in WT and R188, T223 and S221 in G221S-StAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020178-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Steered molecular dynamic simulations showed a slight but consistent delay of 2 ps in the release of cholesterol from the S221-StAR compared to WT StAR (10 versus 8 ps). Further analysis of cholesterol binding by looking at all the contacts revealed additional contacts between C5 and C6 of cholesterol molecule and R188 in case of S221-StAR that may be responsible for this delay. Therefore, potential mechanism for the partial loss of function of G221S-StAR could be due to the alterations in binding/release of the cholesterol molecule resulting from structural changes in the cholesterol binding pocket. It is possible that multiple modes of cholesterol binding and exit may exist in the function of StAR protein as suggested by two different models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Murcia1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Baker2">[29]</xref> and any impairments caused by mutations may affect one or both of the mechanisms of cholesterol binding and exit in the StAR protein.</p>

Western blot analysis confirmed similar levels of expression of both the mutant G221S and the wt StAR protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020178-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). By contrast, the StAR mutation T44H_S46X which is predicted to shorten the StAR protein from 285 amino acids to only 45 amino acids, was not detected in our Western blots, either due to degradation of smaller protein fragment or smaller fragment running off the gel. Assessment of pregnenolone production in cell supernatants by ELISA revealed similar pregnenolone production rate for the T44H_S46X mutant as for vector control (data not shown on the graph). By contrast, compared to the wt StAR the G221S mutant produced 30&#x2013;50% pregnenolone over the observation period of 5&#x2013;600 min while the L260P mutant (which is associated with severe CLAH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Flck1">[32]</xref>) produced pregnenolone only to the basal levels of the vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020178-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>

            <p>COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors for the side chain cleavage system (F2) and wild-type (WT) or mutant StAR. A) Protein expression was assessed by Western blot. B) The ability to produce pregnenolone (Preg) was measured in the cell supernatants after 5&#x2013;600 min using a commercially available ELISA assay. Results are given as mean &#xB1; SD. StAR independent Preg production of the cell system was assessed by using empty vector/F2 and adding 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22R OH-Chol) to the cell medium.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Two siblings (a boy and a girl) were diagnosed 30 years ago with congenital adrenal hyperplasia and were treated with glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids although no clear signs of salt loss were present except for a moderately elevated PRA in the girl. Mineralocorticoid therapy was withdrawn in the boy at the age of 17 years without clinical problems as expected, while the sister continues with the therapy due to moderately low plasma sodium values with normal potassium levels, although the PRA has not been assessed further. These familial cases were considered to have a FGD syndrome and analyzed for the candidate genes. After finding that <italic>MC2R</italic> and <italic>MRAP</italic> gene sequences were normal, two novel <italic>StAR</italic> mutations were identified, one of paternal, the other of maternal origin. This raises the number of families with reported late-onset, nonclassic CLAH (NCLAH) with <italic>StAR</italic> mutations to over 10 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0020178-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

      <p>Like in other reported cases of NCLAH (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0020178-t001">Table 1</xref>), gonadal function was normal during fetal life in the boy and in both siblings during pubertal development and through adulthood up to their present age. The female patient has regular menses and normal gonadotropin levels at the age of 32 years; the male patient has normal serum testosterone with gonadotropin levels at the upper normal limit and inhibin B in the lower normal range at age 29 years. As neither of them has attempted to have children, fertility remains unanswered. Similarly, evolution of their gonadal function remains uncertain. The cases of (N)CLAH reported to date show a wide variation in the gonadal function involvement in both females and males. In 46,XX females, this may range from normal fertility and age at menopause to infertility, progressive increase in LH and development of ovarian cysts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Bose1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Bose2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Tanae1">[34]</xref>. In 46,XY individuals sexual development may be severely affected or only minor anomalies may be found (hypospadias and/or cryptorchidism) or even absent at birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Lin1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Bose1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Baker1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Metherell1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Sahakitrungruang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Flck1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Prader1">[35]</xref>. Accordingly, 46,XY individuals without major genital anomalies may have normal pubertal development and adulthood sexual function; however, infertility may also develop gradually with age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Metherell1">[4]</xref>. The overall sex difference in gonadal failure, which is even seen with the loss-of-function StAR mutations, is thought to be explained by the fact that the ovaries are quiescent and inactive from fetal life to puberty but the testes are fully active in a 46,XY fetus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Bose1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Bose2">[33]</xref>. Therefore, as the stimulation of steroidogenesis in a StAR deficient milieu will lead to accumulation of cholesterol and cell damage over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Bose1">[2]</xref>, it seems plausible that partial loss of StAR will damage steroidogenic cells to a lesser degree, and that the adrenal cortex and the testes (both of which are fully active in utero) will be affected earlier than the ovaries.</p>
      <p>The age at the presentation and the diagnosis of adrenal failure and the degree of mineralocorticoid deficiency show large variations among the patients described (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0020178-t001">Table 1</xref>), ranging from adrenal failure at 2&#x2013;4 years of age with mild hyperreninemia in the first described patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Baker1">[3]</xref> to the lack of diagnosis and treatment at 58 years of age without evidence of mineralocorticoid deficiency in another series <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Metherell1">[4]</xref>. Our patients presented with typical symptoms of adrenal failure (hypoglycemia and dehydration) at the age of 10 and 14 months; both had cortisol deficiency but no obvious mineralocorticoid deficiency.</p>
      <p>To date 9 StAR mutations have been reported as causing NCLAH because of clinical manifestations and/or <italic>in vitro</italic> functional testing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0020178-t001">Table 1</xref>). Recently, a comparison of three <italic>in vitro</italic> assays to test StAR function revealed a significant inter- and between assay variability with the best phenotype correlation coming from the direct assays measuring pregnenolone production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Sahakitrungruang1">[5]</xref>. It appeared that StAR mutations with more than 10&#x2013;20% of wt activity <italic>in vitro</italic> may rather manifest as NCLAH (or FGD) while an activity of less than 10% may be found with severe forms of CLAH. Concordant clinical and functional findings suggested that NCLAH exists for StAR mutations V187M, R188C, R192C, and G221S <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Baker1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Metherell1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Sahakitrungruang1">[5]</xref>. Similarly, G221D StAR was manifesting with isolated cortisol deficiency, but revealed only 3% activity in the functional assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Sahakitrungruang1">[5]</xref>. As revealed by our structural model of StAR, all these residues are at the cholesterol binding pocket with R188 making a direct contact with the cholesterol. A disruption in this interaction by mutation of the R188 residue or the structural shifts in the cholesterol binding pocket due to mutations of neighbouring residues will likely cause disruption in either the binding or the release of cholesterol. Although StAR mutations A218V, M225T and L275P have been tested in vitro as being partially active (14%, 43%, 24% respectively), clinical findings of patients harboring these mutations qualify for the classic form with neonatal onset of disease and/or severe 46,XY DSD at birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Bose1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Nakae1">[36]</xref>. The C-terminus helix in StAR provides the boundary for cholesterol binding pocket and both L260 and F267 are involved in interaction with cholesterol during binding/release. The F267S mutation had low in vitro activity, manifested with a severe form of 46,XY DSD and early adrenal insufficiency (10 weeks) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0020178-Sahakitrungruang1">[5]</xref>; and qualifies therefore for the classic form of CLAH.</p>
      <p>In summary, we report two novel StAR mutations found in compound heterozygote form in two related patients (sister and brother) presenting with isolated glucocorticoid deficiency. The T44H_S46X mutation encoded a 45 aa protein which was completely inactive. The G221S StAR mutation retained more than 30% of wt activity explaining the mild phenotype.</p>
