      <abstract>
        <p>A rare case of sudoriferous cyst of the orbit occurring in an
adult, who had facial trauma, is reported. Several factors
suggest its adult onset. The only other case reported in an
adult is of presumed childhood origin. Very few congenital
cases have been reported. A 65-year-old lady presented with
recent onset of left-sided ptosis and a painless mass below the
left supraorbital margin. The patient had traumatic ptosis after
a road traffic accident 13 years ago. The ptosis was surgically
repaired, which resulted in symmetrical palpebral apertures.
Computed tomographic scan revealed a well-defined cystic mass
in the anterior orbit. The mass was removed <italic>in toto</italic> by anterior
orbitotomy. Histopathological examination revealed a single cyst
lined by double-layered cuboidal epithelium in some areas and
transitional epithelium at others. A periodic acid Schiff (PAS)
positive, diastase-resistant glycocalyx lined the inner epithelium.
Apical snouting suggested an apocrine nature. This confirmed a
diagnosis of sudoriferous cyst.</p>

    <p>Sudoriferous cysts are cysts of sweat gland origin. Sweat
glands are found distributed throughout the body in the skin
with special concentration in the axillae, nipples, perianal and
perigenital areas. They also occur as modified glands in the
following areas: eyelids as Moll&#x2032;s glands, breast as mammary
glands and auditory canal as ceruminous glands secreting
wax.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Whereas sudoriferous cysts are common in the lids, their
occurrence in the orbit is extremely rare.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></p>

      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>A 65-year-old lady presented to our hospital in July with a 10-day
history of left-sided ptosis and a mass below her left superior
orbital rim. There was no history of recent trauma. She had
suffered a road traffic accident 13 years ago and the injuries she
sustained left her with facial asymmetry, slight enophthalmos,
ptosis and diminished vision, all on the left side. She underwent
lid repair for traumatic ptosis 7 years ago after which her
palpebral apertures were symmetrical. Thereafter, she remained
asymptomatic and did not have any ocular complaints, which
could necessitate a visit to an ophthalmologist.</p>
      <p>The patient had a full ocular examination at our hospital
2 months previously for painless progressive loss of vision
on the right. At that time, no ptosis or mass was present. She
had bilateral immature senile cataracts. The left eye had a
traumatic mydriasis with a 5-mm, non-reactive pupil and a
relative afferent pupillary defect. Intraocular pressures were
normal. A juxtamacular scar (found inactive on fluorescein
angiography) was present in the right fundus and the left had
mild disc pallor.</p>
      <p>On her current (July) visit, her best-corrected visual acuities
were 20/40 and 7/200, right eye and left eye respectively. She
had facial asymmetry, with hollowing of the left temporal area,
flattening of left upper cheek, and mild left enophthalmos.
There was severe ptosis of the left upper lid. A well-defined
swelling, approximately 1.5 cm in diameter was present
medially below the left supraorbital margin [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1A">Fig. 1A</xref>]. It was
non-tender, smooth, fluctuant, and fairly mobile without any
fixation to the overlying skin but fixed at its base. The upper
edge of the swelling could not be palpated under the bony
margin. On lid eversion, the swelling was above the upper
tarsal border. The extra-ocular movements in the left eye were
restricted in elevation. The levator muscle action was 14 mm
on the right side and 5 mm on the left. Other ocular findings
were as before.</p>
      <p>Computed tomographic scan of the orbits showed
a well-defined, anteriorly situated cystic swelling of
1.8 cm &#xD7; 1.6 cm  &#xD7; 1 cm size [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1B">Fig. 1B</xref>] on the left. Ultrasound
examination corroborated the cystic nature of the swelling.
The patient underwent anterior orbitotomy under local
anesthesia and sedation. After opening the orbital septum, a
large cyst was removed <italic>in toto</italic> after dissecting its adhesions to
the levator aponeurosis and its fibers [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1C">Fig. 1C</xref>. The thinned
levator aponeurosis was then attached below the superior
tarsal border. Postoperatively, her palpebral apertures were
symmetrical [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1D">Fig. 1D</xref>].</p>
      <p>Gross examination showed that the cyst measured
1.6 cm  &#xD7; 1.5 cm &#xD7; 1 cm [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1E">Fig. 1E</xref>]. Cut surface revealed a
unilocular cyst filled with a clear fluid. The translucent cyst
wall was 0.1-0.2 cm thick. Histopathological examination
showed a cavity lined by a two-layered cuboidal epithelium
in many areas and transitional epithelium in others [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1F">Fig. 1F</xref>.
The surrounding fibrofatty tissue showed congested vessels
and sparse mononuclear infiltrate. Periodic acid Schiff (PAS)
diastase stain showed a positive apical glycocalyx and diastase-
resistant granules. Apical snouting was seen in the inner lining
cells suggestive of an apocrine cyst [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1G">Fig. 1G</xref>]. A diagnosis of
sudoriferous cyst was made.</p>
      <p>There was no recurrence of cyst formation or ptosis at 1-year
postoperative follow-up.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Orbital cysts/structural lesions account for 5-30% of the
lesions in various reported series of orbital tumors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> A lucid
classification of the differential diagnosis has been proposed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
Dermoid cysts are the most frequent and others include
cysts of surface epithelium, teratogenous cysts, neural cysts,
inflammatory cysts, and secondary cysts from adjacent
structures. Acquired cysts include mucocoeles, implantation
cysts, and lacrimal ductal cysts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> Apocrine gland
cysts come under the category of simple epithelial cysts. Different cysts
have their own characteristic histological features.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></p>
      <p>Sudoriferous cysts (or hidrocystomas) are cysts of sweat
gland origin. Sudoriferous glands are of two varieties based
on the method of secretion; in the apocrine variety, the lining
cells release the apical part of their cytoplasm, the remainder
of the cell being viable. The eccrine-type sustain no loss of cell
structure. Sudoriferous cysts arising from the sweat glands of
Moll are usually found in the lids and are apocrine in type.</p>
      <p>Orbital sudoriferous cysts are extremely rare and only a few
have been reported in children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> In the only reported
adult case,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> the cyst was presumed to have developed in childhood
and grown gradually. Bone remodeling and orbital enlargement
suggested the long-standing nature of the lesion. In our case,
there was no bone remodeling; the swelling was of recent onset
and a lid operation performed earlier elsewhere failed to reveal
any cystic lesion. All this indicates that the sudoriferous cyst
was probably of adult origin.</p>
      <p>It is known that implantation of epithelial cells into
deeper tissues at the time of any injury leads to formation
of epithelial inclusion cysts. For congenital sudoriferous
cysts, it is hypothesized that sequestration at the embryonic
stage of epithelial cells destined to form glands of Moll could
lead to cyst formation in the orbit.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> In our patient, there are
two possibilities as to probable origin of this cyst: (i) some
implantation of epithelial cells occurred during the time of lid
surgery, which led to cyst formation much like an inclusion cyst
and (ii) some superficial glandular tissue cells were implanted
into deeper tissue layers at the time of injury and remained
dormant/resulted in a tiny undetected cyst, which gradually
enlarged to noticeable levels over a period of time.</p>
      <p>Had this been a conjunctival inclusion cyst, it would have
had a lining of stratified columnar epithelium; ductal cysts of
lacrimal glandular tissue also have a double layered lining and
may have PAS positive material but the characteristic apical
snouting would be absent.</p>
      <p>More sophisticated tests specific for apocrine cells such
as human milk fat globulin-1 (1.10.F3) monoclonal antibody,
cytoplasmic granules containing epidermal growth factor (EGF)
and others are not universally available. All previous reports
have relied on typical apocrine features seen on hematoxylin
and eosin staining.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Orbital sudoriferous cysts, though earlier reported to be only of
childhood origin, may also be of adult origin. This diagnosis must
also be considered when dealing with orbital cysts in adults.</p>
