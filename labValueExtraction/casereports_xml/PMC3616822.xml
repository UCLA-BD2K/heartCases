      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Circle contact lenses, also known as color contact lenses and big eye contact lenses, are a type of cosmetic contact lens. Circle contact lenses make one's eyes appear larger and come in a variety of colors and effects. They have received rather limited attention outside the Asian population until recently, but trends such as music videos of doll eyed pop stars have, reportedly, led to their increased use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is not generally known that a circle contact lens usually contains iron oxide and other metals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], which means their use during MRI is a potential hazard.</p>
      <p>We present a rare case of incidental discovery of circle contact lenses on MRI. Additionally, we recreated the image of circle contact lenses in vitro.</p>

      <title>Case presentation</title>
      <p>A 28&#xA0;year-old woman who had a cervical desmoid underwent a follow-up MRI. MRI showed an artifact in the globes (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). She had experienced no discomfort or local heat or pain in her eyes during the examination. We asked her about her eyes, and it was proved that she wore circle contact lenses while being imaged in the 3.0 Tesla (3.0&#xA0;T) MRI scanner (Magnetom Trio, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany). One year after this examination, she has not had any eye symptoms.</p>

The diameter of the circle contact lenses was 14.2&#xA0;mm, and the thickness was 0.08&#xA0;mm. We measured a temperature change of circle contact lenses after MRI scan.</p>

      <p>MRI of the gelatin phantom containing circle contact lenses showed susceptibility artifact consistent with extra-wide outer rim of the lenses (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The circle contact lenses was not deformed nor moved after the MRI scan. The total MRI scanning time was 8&#xA0;minutes. After the MRI scan, the temperature of circle contact lenses rose 1.0 degree Celsius (&#xB0;C).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Circle contact lenses have gained popularity in the younger population for their tendency to enlarge and draw attention to the iris. The diameter of regular contact lenses is similar to the diameter of the cosmetic circle contact lenses. The difference between the two types of lenses is that circle contact lenses are tinted not only in the area that covers the iris of the eye, but also has a rim slightly outside this area, usually in a darker color. The result is the appearance of a bigger, wider iris, which creates an illusion of large, doll-like eyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, the extra-wide outer rim of the lens usually contains iron oxide, a known source of susceptibility artifact in MRI scans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Indeed, the circle contact lenses showed susceptibility artifact consistent with extra-wide outer rim of the lenses in our in vitro case. However, the resolution of the clinical scanner used to image the circle contact lenses in vitro (0.86&#xA0;mm in plane, 3&#xA0;mm slice) was larger than the thickness of the circle contact lenses (0.08&#xA0;mm), so that the images in Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> might show the extent of the susceptibility artifacts rather than the circle contact lenses themselves.</p>
      <p>There have been no reports in the English literature about the imaging findings of circle contact lenses in vitro and in vivo on MRI. There was only one Japanese report about the interactions of MR equipment with circle contact lenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. They reported that a circle contact lens was not likely to be affected by the power of absorption by 3.0&#xA0;T MRI. However, they did not verify the extent of temperature change during MRI scan.</p>
      <p>Clinical MRI services should be aware of circle contact lenses as a source of decreased image quality as well as the theoretical risk of burns to the globe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The cosmetic effects of circle contact lenses are much more subtle than the intended audience of computer graphics-enhanced music videos might be led to believe, and it is in fact sometimes difficult to tell they are being worn. Information on the content ratio of iron or other metals in circle lenses has not been made public. Several types of colored contact lenses are available and some of manufactures have revealed the contents, to some extent. Some colored contact lenses do not contain iron oxide. Currently, products of unknown origins may be also distributed. Removal of all contact lenses prior to an MRI examination should continue to be enforced, as it seems the only realistic way to prevent patients from being scanned while still wearing circle lenses.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>We presented a rare case of incidental discovery of circle contact lenses on MRI and the MRI imaging finding of circle lenses in a phantom. Not only physicians but also radiographers and referring physicians should be familiar with the imaging findings and potential risk of scanning circle contact lenses by MRI.</p>
