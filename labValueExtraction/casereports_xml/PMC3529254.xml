  <body>
    <p>A 68-year-old previously healthy man presented with chest discomfort. He was diagnosed with angina pectoris. Chest radiography showed multiple rice-like subcutaneous calcifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The patient confirmed that he had observed these subcutaneous nodules all over his body, which showed no change in number and size for over 10 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). He lived in a rural area where pigs are raised and was fond of consuming pork; further, he confirmed having no past history of seizures and tuberculosis. Total serum immunoglobulin E level was 19.1 IU/mL. Blood enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for <italic>Taenia solium</italic> was negative for cysticercosis IgG antibodies. Stool examination showed normal results. For evaluation of neurocysticercosis, brain computed tomography scan was performed, and a few dot-like calcified lesions in the brain parenchyma was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Femur radiography showed numerous oval-shaped calcifications in the thigh soft tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Analysis of subcutaneous tissue biopsy specimen from the upper left arm showed a well demarcated encapsulated calcific nodule in intramuscular area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B and 2C</xref>). On the basis of the above results, we made a final diagnosis of disseminated cysticercosis. However, the patient presented only palpable subcutaneous nodules, and the diagnosis of disseminated cysticercosis was an incidental finding. No antiparasitic therapy was initiated, and the patient showed no complication at 7 months after diagnosis.</p>
