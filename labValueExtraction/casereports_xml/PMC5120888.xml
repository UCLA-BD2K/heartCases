      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Endodermal cysts (ECs) of the central nervous system (CNS) are rare congenital lesions with endodermal origin, also known as neurenteric or enterogenous cysts. CNS ECs mostly occur in the subdural space of the spinal cord<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>; intracranial ECs are very rare and commonly situated in the posterior cranial fossa as extra-axial lesions,<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> whereas an intraparenchymal location is extremely rare. The cyst requires a complete removal and any residue can lead to recurrence. However, due to lack of diagnostic features, ECs, especially those with intracystic hemorrhage, are often misdiagnosed and treated as brain abscess with aspiration. Here, we present 1 case of intraparenchymal EC with spontaneous intracystic hemorrhage in the temporal lobe of a 43-year-old man. We describe the clinical, imaging, and pathological findings and review the literature with the purpose of providing information for clinical treatment.</p>

      <title>Case report</title>
      <p>A 43-year-old male was admitted to hospital for 3-year headache and memory deterioration. He had a 10-year history of otitis media and no history of head trauma. Neurological examination and hematological test were normal. Brain computed tomography (CT) revealed a cystic lesion in the left temporal lobe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A and B). The cyst wall was hyperdense and slightly enhanced, cyst fluid exhibited low density, and some sediment appeared in the cyst. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a hypodense cyst wall, hyperdense cyst fluid, and isointense sediment on T1- and T2-weighted images (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C and D). Only the cyst wall showed slight enhancement after gadolinium injection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E and F). There was no observable edema around the cyst on both CT and MRI. The patient was diagnosed as having brain abscess based on otitis media history and imaging.</p>

      <p>After 3 days of antibiotic treatment, a subtemporal craniotomy was performed for removing the cyst. During surgery, a brain needle could not be inserted into the cyst due to a tough wall and thereby the lesion was excised totally. We found that the cyst was of intraparenchyma and had a sharp demarcation with adjacent brain tissue. The cyst wall was grayish and solid enough to resist a brain needle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The cyst contained about 10&#x200A;mL dark brown mucoid fluids. After contents were collected, the cyst was fixed in 10% formalin, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin for histological test. Histological examination of the wall showed a thin fibrous membrane lining with columnar epithelial cells and plenty of macrophages, myofibroblasts, inflammatory cells, and cholesterol crystal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A&#x2013;C). Immunohistochemical staining showed that epithelium was positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B) and carcinoembryonic antigen CD68 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C) but negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S-100, and vimentin (not shown), ruling out the epithelium of ectodermal origin. Sporadic staining of CD34 and smooth muscle actin was observed in cyst wall, supporting the cyst of endodermal origin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D and E). Moreover, some epithelial cells stained positive for Ki-67 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>F). Cytology of cyst fluid revealed a mixture of white blood cells and red blood cells, indicating intracystic hemorrhage. Sterile culture of cyst fluids showed no bacterial growth. A final diagnosis was EC based on histological findings.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Intracranial ECs were first reported in 1962 by Small<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> and about 80 to 100 cases have been reported to date.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> They are usually encountered as extra-axial lesions and rarely associated with hemorrhage. We described a case of intraparenchymal EC with intracystic hemorrhage in the temporal lobe, which is the first report of this kind to our knowledge.</p>
      <p>Pathogenesis of CNS EC is thought to associate with persistence of primitive endodermal cells in neurenteric canal in early embryogenesis.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> This theory explained the location of ECs in the spinal subdural space and posterior fossa but not those with supratentorial location. Other theories include anomalous migration of endodermal cells along neurenteric canal cephalad and to lateral positions,<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> which deciphered the decreasing occurrence of ECs from spine to head and lateral supertentorial position. Our case could be explained with a combination of 2 theories, which displayed a fascinating entity of uncertain embryopathogenesis.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p>
      <p>The primary complaint of patients with intracranial ECs is headache. Other symptoms include gait dysfunction, ataxia, and motor, sensory, and memory disturbances.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> These signs may result from mass effect, inflammation, or irritation of adjacent brain tissues.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Supratentorial ECs are reported to have a larger size and later onset of symptoms than those in the posterior fossa.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> The most frequent presentation was seizure, followed by headache, and motor, visual, and cognitive deficits.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Our patient showed a headache and memory deterioration, similar to the patient with intraparenchymal EC reported by Kitamura et al<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> who presented with headache and disorientation. It seems that the symptoms of intraparenchymal ECs are not distinctive from those of other intracranial lesions.</p>
      <p>Imaging features of ECs are variable depending on cyst contents. On CT, ECs may appear as hypodense or hyperdense expansive lesions with a smooth margin.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> On MRI, the signal intensity is typically isointense or slightly hyperintense on T1- and T2-weighted images.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> The signal intensity reflects protein content in cyst fluid, where a higher proteinaceous cyst fluid often has a higher T1-weighted and lower T2-weighted signal.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Generally, ECs cannot be enhanced with contrast on both CT and MRI. Intracystic hemorrhage or fatty components could alter imaging presentation, making diagnosis of EC quite a challenge. In our patient, a higher T1- and T2-weighted signal cyst and slightly enhanced wall was observed, which was suspected as brain abscess based on otitis media history. Nonetheless, the lack of edema surrounding the cyst in the patient was inexplainable.</p>
      <p>Diagnosis of EC is based on histological findings. Histologically, ECs are usually lined with pseudostratified or stratified, ciliated or nonciliated, cuboidal or columnar epithelium adhering to a fibrous base membrane and filled with clear, yellowish or brown milky substances. Immunohistochemical staining of epithelium is positive for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin, and carcinoembryonic antigen but negative for neuroectodermal markers such as GFAP, S-100, and vimentin. Sometimes, the cyst wall involves specialized respiratory/gastroenteric mucosa, well-developed muscularis mucosa, or cartilaginous elements. Our patient showed a positive cytokeratin and negative GFAP and S-100, supporting the diagnosis of EC.</p>
      <p>Intracranial ECs are rarely related to spontaneous hemorrhage, and there are only 4 such cases reported till now.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Of all the reported cases, 1 showed hemorrhage in the subarachnoid space and 3 showed intracystic bleeding. Histological examination of the cyst wall found rich blood vessels, which were thought to be the cause of intracystic hemorrhage. Subarachnoid hemorrhage could be associated with rupture of cyst surface vessels. Both inflammation and leakage of cystic contents could cause rupture of cyst wall vessels.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> We found a wide staining of vessels in the cyst wall, explaining the intracystic hemorrhage and slight enhancement of cyst wall. However, the hemorrhage confused imaging presentation, leading to misdiagnosis. This case told us that intracystic hemorrhage should be considered in cases of cystic lesions with enhanced walls.</p>
      <p>A radical removal of ECs is widely accepted for preventing recurrence.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> A review of recurrent intracranial ECs showed that cyst walls were left in part in the initial surgery of most cases and recurrence occurs at the same site from 2 months to 32 years.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Recurrent ECs could proliferate, migrate, or become malignant, and some of them could release cystic contents into subarachnoid space leading to chemical meningoencephalitis.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> In 1 case of frontal lobe EC, Kitamura et al<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> reported that the cyst recurred at 34 months after cyst aspiration and there was occasional intense headache during the disease process. We performed a total cyst excision in the patient and 3-year follow-up found no recurrence of the lesion. Thus, a complete cyst removal is the best surgical strategy for EC.</p>
