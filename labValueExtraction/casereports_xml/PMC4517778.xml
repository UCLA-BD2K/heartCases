      <abstract>
        <p>Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a rare, heterogeneous disorder characterized by cessation of menstruation occurring before the age of 40 years. Genetic etiology is responsible for perhaps 25% of cases, but most cases are sporadic and unexplained. In this study, through whole exome sequencing in a non-consanguineous family having four affected members with POF and Sanger sequencing in 432 sporadic cases, we identified three novel mutations in the fusion gene <italic>CSB-PGBD3</italic>. Subsequently functional studies suggest that mutated CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein was impaired in response to DNA damage, as indicated by delayed or absent recruitment to damaged sites. Our data provide the first evidence that mutations in the CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein can cause human disease, even in the presence of functional CSB, thus potentially explaining conservation of the fusion protein for 43 My since marmoset. The localization of the CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein to UVA-induced nuclear DNA repair foci further suggests that the CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein, like many other proteins that can cause POF, modulates or participates in DNA repair.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Premature ovarian failure (POF), also known as premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), typically is defined by elevated serum FSH levels prior to the age of 40 years [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Approximately 1% of women are affected. The disorder is heterogeneous, causation including chromosomal abnormalities and single gene mutations, as well as autoimmune, metabolic, infectious and iatrogenic factors [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Evidence for genetic factors has been provided by population and candidate gene studies. Approximately 10 &#x2212; 15% of cases have an affected first or second degree relative [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], although proven genes with functional confirmation exist only for <italic>FMR1</italic>, <italic>NR5A1</italic>, <italic>BMP15</italic>, <italic>NOBOX</italic>, <italic>FIGLA</italic>, <italic>PGRMC1</italic> and <italic>GDF9</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed multiple loci potentially associated with POF in Chinese, Korean, and Dutch [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, in each it was difficult to implicate specific novel genes, and the positive findings were not always replicated. Recently, some causative perturbation has been found in POF associated with somatic anomalies, such as Perrault syndrome and blepharophimosis-epicanthus syndrome type 1 (BPES1), using whole genome or exome sequencing [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, low prevalence and impaired fecundity result in limited pedigrees of POF without associated somatic anomalies (non-syndromic), and whole exome sequencing has not yet been conducted in non-syndromic POF kindreds having more than one affected member until the recent report by Wang, in which compound heterozygous mutation in the HFM1 gene were identified [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
      <p>Here, we reported our results of whole exome sequencing in a Chinese non-consanguineous POF kindred and Sanger sequencing in 432 sporadic POF patients. We identified one heterozygous <italic>PGBD3</italic> mutation in the kindred, and two <italic>CSB-PGBD3</italic> fusion gene mutations among the 432 sporadic patients. All three mutants of <italic>CSB-PGBD3</italic> were impaired in DNA damage repair, as indicated by delayed or absent recruitment to sites of cellular damaged. This could be caused by dysfunctional interaction with RNA polymerase II (RNAPol II). However, other mechanisms could exist.</p>

        <p>To validate exome data and detect independent mutations, we further performed Sanger sequencing of <italic>PGBD3</italic> in 432 sporadic POF patients and 400 matched control females. Clinical features of the two cohorts were shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005419.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.

This resulted in abundant CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein arising by alternative splicing of <italic>CSB</italic> exons 1&#x2013;5 to the <italic>PGBD3</italic> transposase which was conserved in the subsequent primate radiation [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Given that, we sequenced exons 1&#x2013;5 of <italic>CSB</italic> in the two cohorts as well. As a result, we found one additional novel heterozygous missense mutation (ENST00000515869: c.3166G&gt;A, p.V1056I) in <italic>PGBD3</italic> and one heterozygous nonsense mutation (ENST00000515869: c.643G&gt;T, p.E215X) in exon 4 of <italic>CSB</italic> in POF patients; the latter resulted in a truncated protein without PGBD3. Neither perturbation was found among controls (<xref rid="pgen.1005419.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). The women having these two novel variants experienced normal puberty and established regular menses with menarche at 14 and 15 years old, respectively. They presented with secondary amenorrhea at the age of 24 and 25 years respectively, and neither of them had achieved pregnancy. They were of normal height and intellectually normal. Karyotype and FMR1 premutation analysis were normal. Somatic anomalies were not present in any family members.

        <p>U2OS and HeLa cells expressing CSB-PGBD3-RFP or CSB-PGBD3-eGFP (including wild type and three mutants) were exposed to laser micro-irradiation or oxidative damage. Similar to OGG1 (8-Oxoguanine DNA Glycosylase1, responsible for the excision of 8-oxoguanine in response to oxidative damage), which localizes to the laser damaged sites rapidly, wild type CSB-PGBD3-RFP protein was recruited to the damaged sites immediately after laser irradiation, and gradually disappearing around 5 min (<xref rid="pgen.1005419.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Similar response was observed after oxidative damage, in which CSB-PGBD3-eGFP bound onto chromatin immediately after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment and began to separate after 15 min (<xref rid="pgen.1005419.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). Compared to the wild type, the response of mutants p.G746D and p.V1056I to DNA damage was much weaker (<xref rid="pgen.1005419.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>), and the percentage of cells containing CSB-PGBD3-RFP that were recruited to laser damaged sites was significantly lower (22.03% vs. 72.94%, p&lt;0.001 for p.G746D; 30.30% vs. 72.94%, p&lt;0.001 for p.V1056I; respectively) (<xref rid="pgen.1005419.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). For the truncated protein p.E215X, no accumulation was observed at the laser damaged sites (<xref rid="pgen.1005419.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A, 3C and 3D</xref>). However, p.E215X bound onto chromatin immediately after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment but separated from it unexpectedly rapidly (<xref rid="pgen.1005419.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). Protein p.E215X manifested no aggregation in 15 min after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, which was the peak point for the recruitment of wild type, suggesting that p.E215X may not participate in the DNA damage repair.</p>

            <title>Delayed recruitment of CSB-PGBD3 mutants at DNA lesion.</title>
            <p>(A) DNA damage was induced by laser micro-irradiation in the nuclei of U2OS cells expressing wild type and mutant CSB-PGBD3-RFP. (B) OGG1-GFP was recruited to the DNA damage site along with CSB-PGBD3-RFP. (C) Fluorescence accumulation curve showed the recruitment of mutant p.G746D and p.V1056I to damaged sites were weaker compared with wild type, and mutant p.E215X could not accumulate at the damaged site completely. (D) Percentage of reactive cells after laser micro-irradiation was less for mutants compare with wild type (*p&lt;0.001). (E) Western blot for wild type and mutant CSB-PGBD3-eGFP protein attached to chromatin in HeLa cells after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. Mutant p.G746D and p.V1056I bound onto chromatin with a delayed time course compared with wild type. The quick recruitment and separation of p.E215X was elusive. (F) Immunoprecipitation experiments showed the truncated protein p.E215X failed to interact with RNApol II with or without treatment. (G) and (H) showed the clonogenic survival of CSB-PGBD3 tranfected cells suffering UV irradiation. The percent survival relative to the control was significantly higher for wild type compared with the mutants. (Scale bars: 5um)</p>

        <p>It is known that CSB is among the first protein to bind stalled RNA polymerase II (RNApol II) at the sites of DNA damage, and is required to recruit other transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR) factors [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein has been previously shown to interact with RNApol II as well. To verify previous findings and explore defects of identified three mutants, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) between FLAG-CSB-PGBD3 (including wild type and mutants) and RNApol II. No significantly different interaction with RNApol II was observed among p.G746D, p.V1056I and wild type either after UV or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> damage. However, the truncated protein p.E215X failed to associate with RNApol II either after UV or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> damage (<xref rid="pgen.1005419.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). Our clonogenic survival assay further showed that the clonogenic survival percent of wild-type CSB-PGBD3-expressing cells was significantly higher than that of mutants-expressing cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005419.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G and 3H</xref>), indicating a crucial role of functional CSB-PGBD3 played in maintaining cell survival after DNA damage. Taken together, our results suggest that CSB-PGBD3 could play a role in DNA damage repair, and that the mutations we identified impair this normal function of CSB-PGBD.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Whole exome sequencing in a kindred having multiple family members with non-syndromic POF identified the p.G746D mutation in <italic>CSB-PGBD3</italic>, inherited in autosomal dominant fashion. Among 432 sporadic POF cases, we discovered one additional novel missense mutation (p.V1056I) and one nonsense mutation (p.E215X) in <italic>CSB-PGBD3</italic>. Thus, this gene complex needs to be intact for normal ovarian development and maintenance.</p>
      <p>CSB is an important player in TCR pathway. If perturbed, this results in Cockayne Syndrome (CS), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive growth failure, microcephaly, and mental retardation. In CS a dysfunctional DNA repair mechanism exists, nearly 70% of CS caused by perturbation in the <italic>CSB</italic> gene [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. PGBD3 and CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein arose in the common ancestor of humans and marmosets about 43 million years ago and has been highly conserved ever since [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. CSB-PGBD3 has been proved to participate in TCR of DNA damage [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, there is no clear mechanism elucidating the role of PGBD3 plays in CS, nor has a mutation in <italic>PGBD3</italic> been identified in CS.</p>
      <p>Curiously, complete absence of detectable CSB protein does not invariably cause CS: a nonsense mutation at codon 77 in CSB exon 2 causes only mild UV-sensitive syndrome (UVSS) with no syndromic or developmental components [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], whereas complete absence of CSB resulting from deletion of 5' UTR sequences including exon 1 causes classical early onset CS [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Indeed, it may be functionally significant that the novel nonsense mutation p.E215X in our sporadic POF patient, who had no CS, UVSS or other somatic anomalies, has never been found to cause CS [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
      <p>Our finding- perturbations and functional alterations in POF cases- replies that CSB-PGBD3 play a role in ovarian development or maintenance. In the functional study, in response to the output of laser power that induced CSB-PGBD3-RFP to the damage site, OGG1-GFP was recruited to the damage site, indicating that CSB-PGBD3 is recruited to the UVA laser-induced oxidative damage sites, and the presence of functional CSB does not displace the fusion protein from the foci. There are several possible roles played by the proteins localized to DNA damage loci, including direct participants, indirect facilitators, or bystanders. Our study and others indicate that CSB-PGBD3 binds with RNApol II after DNA damage treatments. Combined with the fact that overexpression of CSB-PGBD3 promoted cellular resistance to UV irradiation, it is likely that CSB-PGBD3 is involved in DNA repair.</p>
      <p>CSB-PGBD3 is known to interact with RNApol II through the N-terminal CSB domain [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In our study, the truncated protein E215X (nonsense mutation in CSB exon 4) manifested no binding with RNApol II and no accumulation in the laser damaged site, indicating that CSB-PGBD3 also requires exon 5 to interact with RNApol II. Mutant p.G746D, p.V1056I, and p.E215X did not change the nuclear localization as did wild type, but their response to DNA damage caused by laser/UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was delayed or absent. These results, in aggregate, suggest that CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein may be involved in DNA damage repair and three mutants could be loss of function partly or totally during the process. Therefore, haploinsufficiency of functional CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein might explain POF. However, at least 18 distinct homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in CSB exons 1&#x2013;5 are responsible for CS, and there is no observation of POF in any of the families of affected CS individuals, in which one would expect heterozygous women [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. More likely, the two novel sporadic mutations we observed (E215X and V1056I) acted in a dominant negative fashion.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we demonstrated that CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein was expressed in oocyte, but not in granulosa cells or theca-interstitial cells. Of relevance, DNA damage is one of the most common insults that challenge oocytes [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Ability to repair DNA damage is essential to maintain the supply of oocytes necessary for reproduction. Many DNA repair genes are found to be expressed in oogenesis, such as <italic>BRCA1</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], <italic>HELQ</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and <italic>EXO1</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. If defects occur along the pathway of DNA repair, DNA damage could accumulate; oocytes may also be particularly vulnerable to ubiquitous external damage. Subsequently, the number of damaged follicles may increase with aging, leading to a greater rate of follicle loss through atresia, finally causing POF. Our results suggest that oocytes carrying mutant p.G746D, p.V1056I, and p.E215X either alone or together are unable to repair DNA damage efficiently. This provides direct genetic evidence that perturbation of genes involved in DNA damage repair could lead to non-syndromic POF. Our finding is consistent with recent reports that perturbations of MCM8 and MCM9 are responsible for POF, acting through compromised DNA repair [<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005419.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
      <p>In summary, we found perturbations of CSB-PGBD3 in familial and sporadic patients with POF. Functional studies involving CSB-PGBD3 can provide explanations relevant to ovarian maintenance.</p>
