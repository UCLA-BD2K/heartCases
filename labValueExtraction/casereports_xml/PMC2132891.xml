      <abstract>
        <p>Zellweger syndrome and related diseases are  caused by defective import of peroxisomal matrix proteins. In all previously reported Zellweger syndrome  cell lines the defect could be assigned to the matrix protein import pathway since peroxisome membranes  were present, and import of integral peroxisomal membrane proteins was normal. However, we report here a  Zellweger syndrome patient (PBD061) with an unusual  cellular phenotype, an inability to import peroxisomal  membrane proteins. We also identified human PEX16,  a novel integral peroxisomal membrane protein, and  found that PBD061 had inactivating mutations in the  <italic>PEX16</italic> gene. Previous studies have suggested that peroxisomes arise from preexisting peroxisomes but we  find that expression of <italic>PEX16</italic> restores the formation of  new peroxisomes in PBD061 cells. Peroxisome synthesis and peroxisomal membrane protein import could be  detected within 2&#x2013;3 h of <italic>PEX16</italic> injection and was followed by matrix protein import. These results demonstrate that peroxisomes do not necessarily arise from  division of preexisting peroxisomes. We propose that  peroxisomes may form by either of two pathways: one  that involves PEX11-mediated division of preexisting  peroxisomes, and another that involves PEX16-mediated formation of peroxisomes in the absence of preexisting peroxisomes.</p>

    <p>M<sc>embrane-bound</sc> organelles appear to be synthesized by fission and fusion of homotypic organelles  or budding from heterotypic organelles. These  common modes of organelle biogenesis also represent attractive models for peroxisome biogenesis. The hypothesis  that peroxisomes are derived from the ER was proposed  nearly 30 yr ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Novikoff and Shin, 1964</xref>). However, this  hypothesis was largely abandoned when it was found that  peroxisomal enzymes were imported directly from the cytoplasm to the peroxisome, rather than via the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Lazarow  et al., 1982</xref>). Peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs)<sup>1</sup> are  also imported directly from the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Fujiki et al.,  1984</xref>), and together these results led to the currently favored hypothesis that peroxisomes form by division of  preexisting peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Lazarow and Fujiki, 1985</xref>). However, there is little direct evidence for how peroxisomes  are synthesized.</p>
    <p>To distinguish between these different models for peroxisome biogenesis we and others have searched for mutants that are unable to import PMPs into peroxisomes,  and thus, fail to synthesize peroxisome membranes. In addition to studies in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">H&#xF6;hfeld et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Wiemer et al.,  1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Gotte et al., 1998</xref>) (Gould, S.J., and S. South, manuscript in preparation), we have examined human cell lines  derived from patients who suffer from disorders of peroxisome biogenesis. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders  (PBDs) include Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile Refsum disease, and rhizomelic  chondrodysplasia punctata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Lazarow and Moser, 1995</xref>).  This group of genetically heterogeneous, lethal diseases is  characterized by severe mental retardation, loss of multiple peroxisomal metabolic functions, and defective import  of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins. All  previously characterized PBD cell lines import PMPs normally and contain numerous peroxisomes, leading to the  hypothesis that the PBDs are caused by defects in peroxisomal matrix protein import and not the biogenesis of peroxisome membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Santos et al., 1988a</xref>). The cellular  and molecular analysis of PBD cells has demonstrated that  PMP import is fundamentally different from the matrix  protein import pathways, but until now has done little to  advance our understanding of peroxisome membrane biogenesis, or PMP import.</p>
    <p>Here we describe a cell line from a Zellweger syndrome  patient, PBD061, that differs from previously reported  PBD cell lines. Specifically, it is unable to import PMPs,  and lacks detectable peroxisome membranes. The characterization of PBD061 cells and the gene product defective  in this cell line, PEX16, revealed the following: PEX16 is  required for peroxisome synthesis, and peroxisomes can  form in the absence of preexisting peroxisomes. Possible  mechanisms for peroxisome synthesis in rescued PBD061  cells and in normal cells are discussed.</p>

        <title>Tissue Culture, Cell Lines, and Antibodies</title>
        <p>Skin fibroblasts from PBD patients were obtained from Ann and Hugo  Moser (The Kennedy Krieger Institute, Baltimore, MD), and from the  Coriell Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). All cell lines were cultured in high  glucose DME that was supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and  10% fetal calf serum. Cell lines in this report are referred to by a unique  PBD number with the exception of the normal human fibroblast cell line,  5756T (an SV-40&#x2013;transformed derivative of GM5756; Coriell Cell Repository), and the hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2 (a gift from Michael  Schrader, Baltimore, MD). The CG1 cell line, PBD009, has inactivating  mutations on both <italic>PEX1</italic> alleles, and lacks detectable levels of <italic>PEX1</italic>  mRNA and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Reuber et al., 1997</xref>). The CG2 cell line, PBD005, is  homozygous for an inactivating mutation in <italic>PEX5</italic>, and lacks detectable  levels of <italic>PEX5</italic> mRNA and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Dodt et al., 1995</xref>). The CG3 cell line,  PBD097, is a compound heterozygote for two inactivating frameshift mutations in <italic>PEX12</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Chang et al., 1997</xref>). The CG4 cell line, PBD105, is also  a compound heterozygote for two inactivating frameshift mutations, except in the <italic>PEX6</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Yahraus et al., 1996</xref>). The CG7 cell line, PBD100,  is homozygous for a splice donor site mutation in <italic>PEX10</italic> and expresses a  <italic>PEX10</italic> mRNA with a large internal deletion that lacks <italic>PEX10</italic> activity  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Warren et al., 1998</xref>). The gene that is mutated in cells from complementation group 8 of the PBDs is unknown but the CG8 cell line used in this  study, PBD109, was equally or more severely deficient in peroxisomal matrix protein import than any other CG8 cell line. The CG9 cell line,  PBD061, is equivalent to GM6231, a Zellweger syndrome cell line from  the Coriell Cell Repository. The CG10 cell line, PBD094, is homozygous  for an inactivating nonsense mutation in the <italic>PEX2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Shimozawa et al.,  1992</xref>). The CG13 cell line, PBD222, is the sole representative of this complementation group and was derived from a neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy patient. Again, the gene defective in this patient remains to be determined. Aside from PBD222, all cell lines used in this study were derived  from severely affected Zellweger syndrome patients.</p>
        <p>Antibodies to PMP70 were obtained from Gerardo Jimenez-Sanchez  and David Valle (The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). Antibodies to P70R were obtained from Wilhelm Just (University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany). mAbs to the myc epitope  tag were obtained from the tissue culture supernatant of the hybridoma  1-9E10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Evan et al., 1985</xref>). To generate antibodies to PEX16, we first expressed amino acids 145&#x2013;336 of <italic>PEX16</italic> in fusion with the maltose binding  protein. The resulting maltose binding protein&#x2013;<italic>PEX16</italic> fusion was purified  by affinity chromatography on an amylose resin according to the manufacturer's instructions (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="neb">New England Biolabs Inc.</named-content>). The purified fusion protein was then injected into rabbits and polyclonal sera were collected. The  sera displaying the highest titer against in vitro synthesized PEX16 was  used for all experiments. Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies were  obtained from commercial sources. Horseradish peroxidase&#x2013;labeled anti&#x2013; rabbit secondary antibodies were also obtained from commercial sources.</p>

        <title>Immunofluorescence</title>
        <p>Cells were cultured on glass coverslips and processed for indirect immunofluorescence as follows. Cells were washed twice in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS; 0.2 g/liter KCl, 0.2 g/liter KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 8.0 g/liter  NaCl, 21.6 g/liter Ha<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.1), and fixed for 15 min in 3.7% formaldehyde in DPBS, followed by two washes with DPBS. Unless otherwise  noted, the cells were then permeabilized by incubation in 1% Triton X-100  in DPBS for 5 min to permeabilize all cellular membranes. Cells were  washed twice in DPBS, and incubated with the primary antibody or antibodies for 15 min. All antibody incubations were performed in DPBS that  was supplemented with 5% nonspecific goat serum. Next, the cells were  washed 10 times with DPBS, and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies in 5% nonspecific goat serum and DPBS for 15 min. Cells  were washed 10 times, and mounted on glass slides in a solution of 100 mM  Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 90% glycerol, and 0.1% <italic>para</italic>-phenylenediamine. For  differential permeabilization experiments in which the plasma membrane  is permeabilized but the peroxisome membrane remains intact, the Triton  X-100 incubation was omitted and cells were permeabilized instead by incubation in 25 &#x3BC;g/ml digitonin in DPBS for 5 min. Cells were visualized on  an <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="Olympus">Olympus</named-content> fluorescence microscope and all images were collected on  film (T-Maxx 400; <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="kodak">Eastman-Kodak</named-content>).</p>

        <title>PEX16 Cloning, Mutation Detection, and Plasmids</title>
        <p>Candidate cDNAs for the mammalian <italic>PEX16</italic> gene were identified by  searching the database of expressed sequence tags using the TBLASTN  algorithm. A mouse cDNA capable of encoding a protein similar to <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> PEX16 was identified. The sequence of the murine  <italic>PEX16</italic> cDNA was used to identify a human <italic>PEX16</italic> cDNA by BLAST  searches of the human database of expressed sequence tags. Clones encoding the human <italic>PEX16</italic> cDNA were obtained from Genome Systems  Inc. and sequenced in their entirety. The <italic>PEX16</italic> ORF was also amplified  from a full-length cDNA clone using <italic>PEX16</italic>-specific oligonucleotides  5&#x2032;-CCCGGTACCATGGAGAAGCTGCGGCTCCTGGGC-3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032;-CCAAGCGGCCGCAGTTTTATTAGGGAAGAGGGGC-3&#x2032;. The resulting  PCR products were digested with Asp718 and NotI, and cloned between  the Asp718 and NotI sites of pcDNA3, creating pcDNA3-<italic>PEX16.</italic> The  <italic>PEX16</italic> insert in this plasmid was sequenced in its entirety to ensure that  no mutations were introduced during the cloning process. The cDNA and  deduced protein sequences for human <italic>PEX16</italic> are available from GenBank (accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF118240">AF118240</ext-link>).</p>
        <p>Mutation detection was performed initially by RT-PCR. RNA was extracted from PBD061 cells and from a control human fibroblast and converted to <italic>PEX16</italic> cDNA as follows. Approximately 1 &#x3BC;g of total RNA  from an unaffected individual and from PBD061 was used as template in a  cDNA synthesis reaction using a <italic>PEX16</italic>-specific oligonucleotide (5&#x2032;-CCAAGCGGCCGCAGTTTTATTAGGGAAGAGGGGC-3&#x2032;) and Superscript  reverse transcriptase (Life Sciences Inc.). 3 &#x3BC;l of the cDNA synthesis reaction products was used as template in PCR using the <italic>PEX16</italic>-specific oligonucleotides 5&#x2032;-CCTAAGACCGGAAGCAGGAAGGAG-3&#x2032;, and 5&#x2032;-ACACCCTCCTTCCGGGAGGTCTGT-3&#x2032; that lie in the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; untranslated  regions of the <italic>PEX16</italic> cDNA. A product of the correct size was obtained  from each reaction. However, the yield of <italic>PEX16</italic> cDNA from PBD061  RNA was significantly lower than that obtained from control RNAs, a  result that was consistently observed in multiple experiments. The <italic>PEX16</italic>  cDNAs from the control group, and PBD061 cells were sequenced directly  and in their entirety. The control fragment matched the <italic>PEX16</italic> cDNA sequence exactly. In contrast, the <italic>PEX16</italic> cDNA from PBD061 had a 1-bp  substitution in which the first nucleotide of the arginine 176 codon, CGA,  was converted to a T, terminating the <italic>PEX16</italic> ORF about halfway through  the coding region (data not shown).</p>
        <p>The sequence chromatograph of the <italic>PEX16</italic> cDNA from PBD061  showed no evidence of the C at this position. However, a wide array of  mutations may result in altered mRNA abundance and it is, therefore, common for a mutation to appear homozygous at the cDNA level even though  there may be different mutations on the two alleles in the patient. To test  whether PBD061 cells were homozygous for the R176ter mutation we first  had to determine the <italic>PEX16</italic> genomic organization in the region of the  mutation. Oligonucleotide primers flanking the site of mutation, and  based on the cDNA sequence, were used in various combinations in PCR  reactions with total human genomic DNA from an unaffected individual  as a template. One set of oligonucleotides (5&#x2032;-CAGCCCTGGCAACCATGAGCAGTC-3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032;-CAAAAACTCTGCGATGGTCTCC-3&#x2032;)  amplified a DNA fragment that was &#x223C;100 bp larger than expected from  the cDNA sequence, indicating that it spanned an intron and therefore  would be derived from genomic DNA. Direct sequence analysis confirmed this hypothesis as the cDNA sequences of the amplicon were interrupted by a 134-bp segment that had all of the features of a human intron.  These same oligonucleotides were used to amplify a <italic>PEX16</italic> gene fragment spanning the site of mutation from the genomic DNA of an unaffected individual and PBD061. The structure of each product was determined by direct sequence analysis.</p>
        <p>The <italic>PEX16</italic> expression vector, pcDNA3-<italic>PEX16</italic>, was described above.  The plasmid pcDNA3-<italic>PEX16</italic>/R176ter was created by T/A cloning the  PEX16 RT-PCR product that was generated from PBD061 RNA into the  pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen Corp.). The resulting clone was sequenced in  its entirety to ensure that no other mutations were introduced during the  amplification process. The <italic>PEX16</italic>/R176ter cDNA was released from this  plasmid, pCR2.1-<italic>PEX16</italic>/R176ter, by digestion with EcoRI and cloned  into the unique EcoRI site of pcDNA3, creating pcDNA3-<italic>PEX16</italic>/ R176ter. The COOH-terminal myc-tagged derivative of the <italic>PEX16</italic>  cDNA was generated by PCR using the wild-type <italic>PEX16</italic> cDNA as a template, the oligonucleotide 5&#x2032;-CCCGGTACCATGGAGAAGCTGCGGCTCCTGGGC-3&#x2032; at the 5&#x2032; end and the oligonucleotide 5&#x2032;-CCAAAGATCTGCCCCAACTGTAGAAGTAGATTTTC-3&#x2032; at the 3&#x2032; end, which  replaces the stop codon with a BglII site. The resulting fragment was  cleaved with Asp718 and BglII and inserted between the Asp718 and  BamHI sites of pcDNA3-myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Yahraus et al., 1996</xref>), creating the plasmid  pcDNA3-<italic>PEX16myc.</italic> This plasmid carries a modified <italic>PEX16</italic> ORF that  encodes the 10&#x2013;amino acid long c-myc epitope tag at the COOH terminus  of PEX16. The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal myc-tagged derivative of the <italic>PEX16</italic> cDNA  was generated by PCR using the wild-type <italic>PEX16</italic> cDNA as a template, the  oligonucleotide 5&#x2032;-CCCGTCGACGGAGAAGCTGCGGCTCCTGGGCCTC-3&#x2032; at the 5&#x2032; end and the oligonucleotide 5&#x2032;-CCAAGCGGCCGCAGTTTTATTAGGGAAGAGGGGC-3&#x2032; at the 3&#x2032; end. This cDNA fragment was cleaved with SalI and NotI, and cloned between the XhoI and  NotI sites of the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal myc tag vector, pcDNA3-N-myc. This plasmid carries a high efficiency initiation codon, and the c-myc epitope tag  upstream of the XhoI and NotI sites. The resulting plasmid, pcDNA3- <italic>mycPEX16</italic>, encodes the 10&#x2013;amino acid long c-myc epitope tag at the 5&#x2032; end  of the PEX16 ORF. The plasmid that expresses the maltose binding protein&#x2013;PEX16 fusion (pMBP-PEX16) was created by amplifying a subfragment of the <italic>PEX16</italic> cDNA by PCR using the <italic>PEX16</italic> cDNA as a template,  and the oligonucleotides 5&#x2032;-CCCGTCGACACTGGACAGAGAGACCCAGGCAC-3&#x2032;, and 5&#x2032;-CCAAGCGGCCGCAGTTTTATTAGGGAAGAGGGGC-3&#x2032;. This fragment encoding amino acids 145&#x2013;336 of PEX16,  was cleaved with SalI and NotI, and inserted between the SalI and NotI  sites of pMBP, a modified version of pMALc2 (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="neb">New England Biolabs Inc.</named-content>)  The plasmids designed to express PMP70myc, PEX12myc, PMP32myc,  PEX3myc, PEX11&#x3B1;myc, and PEX11&#x3B2;myc all consist of the full-length human cDNA cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3-myc  in such a way as to encode the 10&#x2013;amino acid myc tag after the COOH-terminal amino acid of each protein, followed immediately by a stop  codon.</p>

Microinjections were performed with  DNA at a concentration of 1 &#x3BC;g/ml in reverse phosphate buffered saline  (4 mM NaHPO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 140 mM KCl, pH 7.3).

        <title>Protein Preps, Fractionations, Protease Protection, and  Western Blots</title>
        <p>Total cellular proteins were extracted from cultured fibroblasts as described  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Dodt and Gould, 1996</xref>). For subcellular fractionation experiments, postnuclear supernatants were prepared from HepG2 cells by homogenization in a  Balch homogenizer followed by successive centrifugation steps to remove  nuclei and unbroken cells. The resulting clarified supernatant was separated by density gradient centrifugation (Nycodenz; Nycomed Pharma) as  described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Dodt et al. (1995)</xref>. Equal amounts of each fraction were assayed for catalase, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and NADPH-cytochrome reductase (NCR) to follow the peroxisomes, mitochondria, and  microsomes, respectively. Equal amounts of each fraction were also separated by SDS-PAGE and assayed for PEX16 levels by Western blot as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Crane et al. (1994)</xref>.</p>
        <p>For membrane extractions, a light mitochondrial pellet was obtained by  centrifugation of a HepG2 postnuclear supernatant at 25,000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min.  The pellet fraction was then extracted with 10 mM Tris, pH 8.3 on ice for  20 min with agitation. This sample was separated into a membrane pellet,  and a soluble supernatant by centrifugation at 200,000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min. The  supernatant was saved and the pellet was subjected to extraction with 1 M  NaCl on ice for 20 min with agitation. This sample was separated into a  membrane pellet, and a soluble supernatant by centrifugation at 200,000 <italic>g</italic>  for 30 min. The supernatant was saved, and the pellet was subjected to extraction with 100 mM Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> pH 11.5 on ice for 20 min with agitation.  The carbonate extracted supernatant and pellet were separated by centrifugation at 200,000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min. The levels of PEX16 in each sample  were determined by semiquantitative Western blotting after separating  equal proportions of the three supernatants and the carbonate extracted  pellet by SDS-PAGE.</p>
        <p>Protease protection experiments were performed as follows. A postnuclear supernatant was prepared from HepG2 cells and a light mitochondrial pellet was obtained as above. This was resuspended in 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mM EDTA. Equal proportions  were aliquoted to eight different tubes. Triton X-100 was added to four of  the tubes to a final concentration of 1%. Either 0, 15, 30, or 60 &#x3BC;g of the  protease trypsin (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="sigma">Sigma Chemical Co.</named-content>) was added to an aliquot that contained Triton X-100 and to an aliquot that lacked protease. These samples  were incubated on ice for 20 min, and protease digestion was terminated  by adding a twofold excess of bovine trypsin inhibitor. Equal proportions  of each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and PEX16 was detected  by Western blot.</p>

        <title>PBD061 Cells Are Defective in PMP Import</title>
        <p>Little is known about the mechanisms of PMP import or  the synthesis of peroxisome membranes. To identify cell  lines that are defective in these processes we screened skin  fibroblasts from over 100 PBD patients for the presence of  PMP-containing peroxisomal structures. Each cell line was  processed for indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies specific for PMP70, an integral membrane protein of  the peroxisome. Previous studies have reported that PBD  cells contain peroxisomes and import PMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Santos et al.,  1988a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">1988b</xref>) and we detected numerous PMP70-containing peroxisomes in virtually all cell lines examined. These  included representatives of complementation groups 1, 2,  3, 4, 7, 8, 10, and 13 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). However, we did identify one  cell line, PBD061, which failed to import PMP70 into peroxisomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, I). This cell line was derived from a severely affected Zellweger syndrome patient and is the sole  representative of PBD complementation group 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Moser  et al., 1995</xref>). To test whether the absence of PMP70 staining  in PBD061 cells reflected a generalized defect in PMP import or a peculiarity of PMP70 distribution, representatives  of all complementation groups were also processed for indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies specific for other  PMPs, including ALDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Mosser et al., 1994</xref>), and P70R  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Shani et al., 1997</xref>). These antibodies also revealed the presence of numerous PMP-containing peroxisomes in representatives of all complementation groups except for the  CG9 cell line, PBD061 (data not shown). </p>
        <p>As an independent test of this phenotype we followed the  distribution of overexpressed PMPs in this cell line. Plasmids designed to express the integral peroxisomal membrane proteins PMP70myc, PEX12myc and PMP32myc (a  human peroxisomal solute carrier) were transfected into  PBD061 cells and a control PBD fibroblast line, PBD094,  which is mutated in the <italic>PEX2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Shimozawa et al.,  1992</xref>). We were unable to detect peroxisomal or vesicular  staining for these PMPs in PBD061 cells, even though all  three proteins were efficiently targeted to peroxisome  membranes in PBD094 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Similar rates of transfection in both cell lines were confirmed by cotransfection  with a cytosolic marker expression vector (data not shown).  Similar results were observed in cells transfected with expression vectors designed to express other human PMPs,  including PEX3myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Kammerer et al., 1998</xref>), PEX10myc  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Warren et al., 1998</xref>), PEX11&#x3B1;myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Schrader et al., 1998</xref>),  PEX11&#x3B2;myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Schrader et al., 1998</xref>), and PEX13myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Gould  et al., 1996</xref>) (data not shown). Although we were unable to  detect peroxisomal or vesicular structures with any of the  11 PMPs tested, it is possible that some as yet unidentified  PMPs may reside in some type of peroxisome-related  structure in PBD061 cells. </p>
        <p>To better understand the fates of PMPs in PBD061 cells,  total cellular protein was extracted from the CG9 cell line,  PBD061, and a CG10 cell line, PBD094, as well as from  PBD061, and PBD094 cells that had been transfected with  the PEX12myc expression vector. The abundance of the  PMPs (PMP70, P70R, PEX14, and PEX12myc) were then  determined by immunoblot with antibodies specific for  each protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). As evident from this experiment, levels of full-length PMP70 and P70R in PBD061 cells were  below the limit of detection in PBD061 cells but were  readily detected in PBD094 cells, indicating that these proteins might be degraded in PBD061 cells. This hypothesis  is supported by the presence of anti&#x2013;P70R-reactive products of lower molecular mass in PBD061 cells, but not in  PBD094 cells. However, this was not the fate of all PMPs,  since levels of PEX14 were similar in PBD061 cells and  PBD094 cells, as were levels of PEX12myc. Thus, the fate  of PMPs in a cell line defective in PMP import varies from  protein to protein, just as the fate of peroxisomal matrix  proteins varies in cells with specific defects in matrix protein import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Lazarow and Fujiki, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Santos et al., 1988a</xref>,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">1988b</xref>). </p>

        <title>Identification of PEX16, the Gene Mutated in CG9 Cells</title>
        <p>The prevailing model of peroxisome biogenesis holds that  peroxisomes are formed by division of preexisting peroxisomes. Thus, it was an open question as to whether peroxisome synthesis could be restored in a cell line such as  PBD061; and the identification of the gene defective in  PBD061 cells would likely have a significant impact on our  understanding of peroxisome biogenesis. We employed  the homology probing strategy that has been used previously to identify human homologues of other yeast <italic>PEX</italic>  genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Dodt et al., 1996</xref>). The database of expressed sequence tags was searched for mammalian homologues of  the <italic>Y. lipolytica PEX16</italic> gene and a single human homologue was identified (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A). This human <italic>PEX16</italic> cDNA  was inserted into a mammalian expression vector and the  resulting plasmid, pcDNA3-<italic>PEX16</italic>, was transfected into  PBD061 cells. 3 d after transfection the cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies  specific for the peroxisome membrane marker, PMP70,  and a peroxisomal matrix protein, catalase. Expression of  <italic>PEX16</italic> rescued both PMP and matrix protein import in  PBD061 cells, demonstrating that peroxisomes can form in  the absence of preexisting peroxisomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). No rescue  was observed in cells transfected with the vector alone. </p>
        <p>The functional complementation experiments described  above indicated that this patient would have mutations in  the <italic>PEX16</italic> gene. The <italic>PEX16</italic> cDNA was amplified from  control and PBD061 RNAs by RT-PCR, and direct sequence analysis revealed the presence of a nonsense mutation in the <italic>PEX16</italic>/PBD061 cDNA population (data not  shown). This mutation, a C-to-T transition at a CpG dinucleotide, converts the arginine 176 codon to a nonsense  codon (R176ter), and appeared to represent the only form  of <italic>PEX16</italic> mRNA present in PBD061 cells. To determine  whether this mutation was present at the genomic DNA  level we amplified an appropriate fragment of the <italic>PEX16</italic>  gene from control and PBD061 genomic DNAs. Direct sequence analysis showed only the mutant form of the gene  in PBD061 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, A and B), indicating that this patient is  homozygous for the R176ter mutation. </p>
        <p>The R176ter mutation is predicted to delete the COOH-terminal half of <italic>PEX16</italic>, suggesting that it may have a severe  effect on gene function. To test this directly we engineered  the R176ter mutation into the <italic>PEX16</italic> cDNA expression  vector and assayed the effects of this mutation by functional  complementation. PBD061 fibroblasts were transfected  with the expression vectors pcDNA3-<italic>HsPEX16</italic>/R176ter  and pcDNA3-<italic>HsPEX16.</italic> After 3 d, cells from each population were processed for indirect immunofluorescence using  anti-PMP70 and anticatalase antibodies to assess the reconstitution of peroxisome biogenesis. The <italic>PEX16</italic>/R176ter cDNA  displayed no rescue activity, indicating that the R176ter mutation had a severe effect on <italic>PEX16</italic> function (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, C&#x2013;F).</p>

        <title>PEX16 Encodes an Integral PMP with Its Termini  Extending into the Cytoplasm</title>
        <p>While the above results demonstrated that PEX16 is required for peroxisome biogenesis they did not reveal how  PEX16 might perform this role. Since the physical location  of proteins can provide useful insight into their function  we first determined the subcellular distribution of PEX16.  Antibodies to PEX16 were generated and recognized a  polypeptide of 38 kD, the predicted molecular mass of  PEX16, in human cell extracts (data not shown). These antibodies were used to localize PEX16 in subcellular fractionation experiments. A postnuclear supernatant was  prepared from HepG2 cells and fractionated by Nycodenz  density gradient centrifugation. Fractions were assayed for  marker enzymes of peroxisomes, mitochondria, and microsomes, as well as PEX16 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> A). PEX16 behaved as  a typical PMP, localizing only to the high-density, catalase-containing peroxisomal fractions (rupture of peroxisomes  during homogenization and centrifugation leads to the  presence of peroxisomal matrix proteins at the top of the  gradient, demonstrated here by the presence of catalase  activity in the low density fractions). </p>
        <p>Sequence analysis predicted that the 336&#x2013;amino acid-long  PEX16 protein contained two transmembrane domains:  one among amino acids 110&#x2013;144, and another spanning  amino acids 222&#x2013;243 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> A). To test the hypothesis that  PEX16 was a PMP we prepared another postnuclear supernatant from HepG2 cells and collected peroxisomes, mitochondria, and other large organelles by centrifugation at  25,000 <italic>g.</italic> This light mitochondrial fraction was subjected to  successive extractions with hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris,  pH 8.5), high salt (1 M NaCl), and high pH (100 mM  Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, pH 11.5). These treatments are designed to release  soluble peroxisomal enzymes, electrostatically associated  membrane proteins, and tightly associated membrane proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Fujiki et al., 1982</xref>). Integral PMPs are  predicted to remain in the carbonate-extracted membrane  pellet. Western blot analysis revealed that PEX16 behaved  as an integral PMP, remaining in the membrane pellet even  after carbonate extraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> B).</p>
        <p>To assess the topology of PEX16 in the peroxisome  membrane we first performed protease protection experiments on a light mitochondrial fraction of HepG2 cells.  Exogenous protease reduced PEX16 from 38 to 15 kD in  the absence of detergent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> C), demonstrating that a  significant portion of PEX16 extends into the cytoplasm.  The anti-PEX16 antibodies used in this experiment were  raised against its COOH-terminal 189 amino acids, which  comprises the segment between the two transmembrane  domains, the second transmembrane domain, and the 10-kD  COOH-terminal tail. The only topology that is consistent  with these results is for PEX16 to reside in the peroxisome  membrane with its NH<sub>2</sub> and COOH termini extending  into the cytoplasm and its intermembrane loop protected  in the peroxisome lumen.</p>
        <p>To test PEX16 orientation by an independent method we  generated tagged versions of the <italic>PEX16</italic> cDNA expression  vectors: one designed to express the c-myc tag at the NH<sub>2</sub>  terminus of PEX16 (pcDNA3-<italic>mycPEX16</italic>), and one designed to express the c-myc tag at its COOH terminus  (pcDNA3-<italic>PEX16myc</italic>). Normal human fibroblasts were  transfected with these plasmids. After 2 d of incubation, the  cells were processed for immunofluorescence using antibodies specific for the myc epitope tag and for catalase, a  peroxisomal matrix protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The mycPEX16 and  PEX16myc proteins both colocalized with catalase, confirming that PEX16 is a peroxisomal protein. Furthermore,  the mycPEX16 and PEX16myc proteins were detected under differential permeabilization conditions that preclude  the detection of intraperoxisomal antigens, confirming that  PEX16 is a peroxisomal membrane protein with its NH<sub>2</sub>  and COOH termini extending into the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, overexpression of mycPEX16 or PEX16myc never induced peroxisome proliferation, suggesting that there may  be a functional distinction between factors that are required  for peroxisome membrane synthesis and those that are involved in peroxisome proliferation, such as PEX11&#x3B1; and  PEX11&#x3B2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Schrader et al., 1998</xref>). In control experiments, the  mycPEX16 and PEX16myc expression vectors were able to  rescue peroxisome synthesis in PBD061 cells, confirming  that these localization studies were performed with functional forms of PEX16 (data not shown). </p>

        <title>Biogenesis of PEX16</title>
        <p>PEX16 was first identified in the yeast <italic>Y. lipolytica.</italic> Although previous studies of PMP biogenesis have reported  that they are synthesized in the cytoplasm and imported  into peroxisomes posttranslationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Lazarow and Fujiki,  1985</xref>), the analysis of <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic> PEX16 suggested that  this protein is inserted into the ER, and it traffics to peroxisomes in a <italic>PEX1</italic>- and <italic>PEX6</italic>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Eitzen  et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Titorenko et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Titorenko and Rachubinski, 1998b</xref>). This model for PEX16 biogenesis is built  on the following observations: YlPEX16 accumulates in  the ER in the absence of either the <italic>PEX1</italic> or <italic>PEX6</italic> genes;  a pulse of YlPEX16 expression can be detected first in the  ER and subsequently in the peroxisome; and YlPEX16 is  modified by N-linked glycosylation. Given that the loss of  human <italic>PEX16</italic> results in the absence of peroxisomes from  the cell, a similar biogenic pathway for human PEX16  would implicate the ER as a possible source of newly synthesized peroxisomes in rescued PBD061 cells.</p>
        <p>We first examined the distribution of PEX16myc in cells  that lack <italic>PEX1.</italic> PBD009 cells have inactivating mutations  on both <italic>PEX1</italic> alleles, lack <italic>PEX1</italic> mRNA and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Reuber et al., 1997</xref>), and would be expected to accumulate  PEX16myc in the ER. In contrast to the expected results,  we found that PEX16myc colocalized with the peroxisomal membrane marker, P70R, in <italic>PEX1</italic>-deficient PBD009  cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, A and B). Next, we replicated the pulsed expression experiments. However, because of the need to  detect PEX16myc at the very earliest time points during  its expression, we had to deliver the PEX16myc expression  vector by nuclear microinjection rather than electroporation. The normal human fibroblast line 5756T was injected  with pcDNA3-<italic>PEX16myc</italic> and then processed for indirect  immunofluorescence at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h after injection.  The first time point that we detected PEX16myc expression was 2 h after injection, at which point all of the  PEX16myc appeared to colocalize with the peroxisomal  membrane marker, P70R (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, C and D). Examination  of multiple cells at the 2- and 3-h time points showed a  similar peroxisomal distribution of PEX16myc. The fact that  human PEX16 lacks a consensus sequence for N-linked  oligosaccharide addition, Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr, made it impossible to follow N-linked glycosylation as a test of  whether PEX16 entered the ER before its delivery to peroxisomes. </p>
        <p>The recent evidence for ER involvement in peroxisome  biogenesis is not limited to the biogenesis of PEX16 in <italic>Y.  lipolytica.</italic> Other tantalizing evidence includes the observation that brefeldin A (BFA) blocks peroxisome biogenesis  in <italic>Hansenula polymorpha</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Solomos et al., 1997</xref>), and the  finding that ARF and COPI may play a role in peroxisome  proliferation in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Passreiter et al., 1998</xref>).  Since PEX16 plays an essential role in peroxisome synthesis we tested whether BFA might block the targeting of  PEX16 to peroxisomes in normal cells. Normal human fibroblasts were incubated in 10 &#x3BC;g/ml BFA for 30 min and  then injected with the pcDNA3-<italic>PEX16myc</italic> expression vector. The cells were maintained in the same concentration of  BFA and processed for indirect immunofluorescence at  various times after injection. Peroxisomal PEX16myc was  detected in peroxisomes 2 h after injection, demonstrating  that BFA did not inhibit the targeting of PEX16myc to  peroxisomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, E and F). We also tested whether incubation at 15&#xB0;C, a treatment that blocks exit of proteins  from the ER/Golgi intermediate compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Saraste  and Kuismanen, 1984</xref>), had any effect on PEX16myc targeting to peroxisomes. We failed to detect any significant  inhibition of PEX16myc targeting to peroxisomes in cells  incubated at 15&#xB0;C as compared to cells incubated at 37&#xB0;C  (data not shown).</p>
        <p>These experiments failed to provide evidence for an ER  role in PEX16myc biogenesis. Most proteins which enter  the ER do so cotranslationally, and, thus, are never  present in the cytosolic fraction before association with a  sedimental organelle. We attempted to follow the biogenesis of PEX16 in pulse&#x2013;chase experiments but were unable  to incorporate enough radioactivity into newly synthesized  PEX16 to detect the protein after even a long (1 h) pulse  labeling period (data not shown). Therefore, we were unable to use pulse&#x2013;chase experiments to determine whether  PEX16 enters the peroxisome directly from the cytoplasm  or indirectly through the ER.</p>

        <title>Peroxisome Synthesis in Rescued CG9 Cells</title>
        <p>The restoration of peroxisome synthesis in PBD061 cells  demonstrated that peroxisomes do not necessarily arise by  division of preexisting peroxisomes. To characterize the  process by which this occurs we followed the appearance of  peroxisomes at various times after injection of PBD061 cells  with the <italic>PEX16</italic> expression vector. At each time point, cells  were processed for indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies specific for the peroxisomal membrane marker,  PMP70, and the peroxisomal matrix marker, catalase. We  were unable to detect any peroxisomal structures 30 min, 1,  or 2 h after injection. However, by 3 h after injection we  started to observe P70R-containing structures that could be  detected over and above background staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, A and  B). These structures generally did not contain the matrix  protein catalase, and were much reduced in number as compared to normal cells or fully rescued PBD061 cells. In addition, peroxisomes detected at early time points often appeared to form elongated structures similar to those that  form at early times in the PEX11&#x3B2;-mediated proliferation  of human peroxisomes. </p>
        <p>At later time points, &#x223C;18&#x2013;24 h after injection or transfection, peroxisomes of more normal distribution and abundance could be detected, although these commonly lacked  significant levels of catalase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, C and D). At later time  points (36&#x2013;72 h after injection or transfection), the proportion of rescued cells that contained both P70R and catalase  increased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, E and F), although it never attained unity.  In no instance did we observe punctate catalase in the absence of P70R-containing peroxisomes (data not shown).  Taken together, these results suggest that peroxisome synthesis occurs in a multistep fashion beginning with the formation of a limited number of PMP-containing vesicles, followed by the elongation and proliferation of peroxisomal  structures, and ending with the robust import of peroxisomal membrane and matrix proteins. However, it should be  noted that low but detectable numbers of catalase-importing cells could be detected at early time points after injection of the <italic>PEX16</italic> expression vector. Similar rates of rescue  were observed in the presence of BFA, demonstrating that  peroxisome synthesis is insensitive to this inhibitor of vesicular transport (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, G and H).</p>
        <p>We repeated these kinetic studies using the PEX16myc  expression vector. PBD061 cells were injected with pcDNA3- <italic>PEX16myc</italic> and processed for indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies specific for the myc epitope tag and  for P70R. As with the wild-type expression vector, rescue  could not be detected until 3 h after injection. At this time  point, some cells contained punctate structures that contained both PEX16myc and P70R, but a few cells were observed that contained only PEX16myc (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). </p>

    <sec id="Discussion">
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have identified human <italic>PEX16</italic>, and established that an  inactivating mutation in this gene abolishes the synthesis  of peroxisomes in a Zellweger syndrome patient, PBD061.  These results expand the range of phenotypes and genotypes that are associated with Zellweger syndrome, and  thus, expand our understanding of this lethal disease.  However, this study also enhances our understanding of  the molecular events involved in formation of peroxisome  membranes. Most importantly, the rescue of peroxisome  synthesis in PBD061 cells by <italic>PEX16</italic> expression demonstrates that preexisting peroxisomes, defined here as PMP-containing vesicles, are not required for the formation of  new peroxisomes. While the elucidation of PEX16 function clearly requires additional studies our results do provide some insight into the biogenesis of peroxisome membranes, at least in humans.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the simplest model for peroxisome synthesis in  rescued PBD061 cells would be that PEX16 expression allows the synthesis of peroxisomes from phospholipids and  PMPs rather than preexisting vesicles. However, this appears unlikely since there is no precedent for the synthesis  of biological membranes other than from a preexisting  lipid bilayer. An alternative hypothesis is that PEX16, either alone or in conjunction with other proteins, converts a  preperoxisomal vesicle to recognizable peroxisomes by  mediating the import of other PMPs. This in turn would  lead to assembly of the matrix protein import apparatus,  and the subsequent import of peroxisomal matrix proteins,  completing the formation of mature peroxisomes.</p>
      <p>Although this may explain the formation of peroxisomes during the rescue of PBD061 cells it is questionable  whether such a simple model can explain peroxisome synthesis under all conditions. For instance, if peroxisomes  were typically formed by such a process we would expect  that the biogenesis of peroxisomes in PBD061 cells would  occur on roughly the same time course as the import of  PEX16 into peroxisomes of normal cells. However, this is  clearly not the case as PEX16 is imported into virtually all  peroxisomes of normal cells in &lt;2 h whereas the reconstitution of normal peroxisomes in PBD061 cells requires  18&#x2013;24 h. Furthermore, this model fails to incorporate roles  for the proliferation factors PEX11&#x3B1; and PEX11&#x3B2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Schrader  et al., 1998</xref>) in the formation of peroxisomes.</p>
      <p>These and other lines of evidence suggested instead that  peroxisome formation may occur by two distinct, yet overlapping pathways (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). In this model, peroxisomes  would typically form by division of preexisting peroxisomes in a process mediated by PEX11&#x3B1; and PEX11&#x3B2;, not  PEX16. This would explain the hyperabundance of peroxisomes in cells overexpressing PEX11&#x3B1; or PEX11&#x3B2;, and  the fact that overexpression of PEX16 does not induce any  detectable proliferation of peroxisomes. In this model,  PEX16 would function normally in importing PMPs into  preexisting peroxisomes, and would itself be imported into  preexisting peroxisomes. In the absence of PEX16, PMP  import would cease, peroxisomes could not divide, and the  organelle would eventually be lost from the cell population. In addition to this common route of peroxisome formation we propose that PEX16 may, at low efficiency, be  targeted to an unknown preperoxisomal structure. The incorporation of PEX16 into such vesicles may convert them  to nascent peroxisomes that are able to import other  PMPs, and eventually to mature peroxisomes. This model  would not only explain the ability of PEX16 to rescue  PBD061 cells but would also explain: the presence of a  few, large peroxisomes in mutants lacking the <italic>PEX11</italic> gene  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Erdmann and Blobel, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Marshall et al., 1995</xref>); the peroxisome proliferation promoting activity of PEX11 proteins; and the lack of peroxisome proliferation promoting  activity for PEX16. </p>
      <p>This model is consistent with virtually all available data  on the formation of peroxisomes. However, it proposes  the existence of a structure that has yet to be identified,  the preperoxisome, and proposes an activity for PEX16  for which there is no direct evidence, PMP import. Nevertheless, this model serves as a useful starting point for considering how peroxisomes are formed. The preperoxisomal structure need not be a dedicated structure awaiting  PEX16 for conversion into a nascent peroxisome, only a  subcellular vesicle that happens to incorporate a PEX16  molecule. As for the function of PEX16, our only evidence  that this protein is involved in PMP import is the inability  of PBD061 cells to import PMPs into peroxisomes, a phenotype that is also consistent with a defect in the synthesis  of the preperoxisomal structure of our model. Nevertheless, PEX16 has the appropriate structural requirements  for a role in PMP import. PEX16 is itself an integral PMP  and extends its NH<sub>2</sub> and COOH termini into the cytoplasm where they may facilitate the recognition of PMPs  and/or their insertion into the peroxisome membrane. In  addition, PEX16 appears to be transported efficiently to  peroxisomes, and is detected only in peroxisomes, not  some other compartment, at steady state. It should be  noted that similar models have been proposed that implicate the ER as the source of the preperoxisomal structure  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Kunau and Erdmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Titorenko and Rachubinski,  1998a</xref>). However, our data do not provide evidence for a  role of the ER in peroxisome biogenesis.</p>
      <p>In addition to improving our understanding of peroxisome synthesis and the molecular basis of Zellweger syndrome, this report also makes clear that homologues of the  same peroxisome biogenesis factor may have disparate  roles in different organisms. Although we identified human  PEX16 by its sequence similarity to <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic> PEX16,  there were significant differences between these proteins.  Prior reports have established that YlPEX16 is peripherally  associated with the inner face of the peroxisome membrane,  and transported to peroxisomes via the ER in a <italic>PEX1</italic>- and  <italic>PEX6</italic>-dependent manner. Despite it playing a role in the import of a subset of peroxisomal matrix proteins, YlPEX16 is  not required for synthesis of peroxisome membranes nor  PMP import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Eitzen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Titorenko et al., 1997</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Titorenko and Rachubinski, 1998b</xref>). In contrast, human  PEX16, an integral PMP with its NH<sub>2</sub> and COOH termini  exposed to the cytoplasm, is required for PMP import and  peroxisome synthesis, and appears to traffic from the cytoplasm to the peroxisome in a <italic>PEX1</italic>-independent manner.  These differences emphasize the need for caution in extrapolating the functions of a particular peroxisome biogenesis  factor to its homologue in divergent species. Discretion in  this matter is emphasized further by the fact that the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> genome lacks a PEX16 homologue,  even though the YlPEX16 and human PEX16 proteins  share 24% amino acid identity.</p>

Equal proportions of  each fraction were assayed for the marker enzymes catalase, a  peroxisomal enzyme, SDH, a mitochondrial marker, and NCR,  an ER-associated enzyme. Equal proportions of each fraction  were also assayed for levels of PEX16 by immunoblot (bottom).  These antibodies also detect an unknown protein of slightly  higher mobility in fraction 10.

A light mitochondrial fraction  from HepG2 cells was separated into a hypotonic extraction supernatant (lane 1); a high salt extraction supernatant (lane 2); a  high pH carbonate supernatant (lane 3); and a pellet of carbonate-washed membranes (lane 4). Equal proportions of each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and assayed for levels of  PEX16 by Western blot. (C) Protease protection experiments indicate that PEX16 spans the membrane twice with its NH<sub>2</sub> and  COOH termini exposed to the cytoplasm.

          <p>A model of peroxisome biogenesis in the absence  (top) and presence (bottom) of  preexisting peroxisomes. During  rescue of PBD061 cells, PEX16  creates nascent peroxisomes, possibly from a preperoxisomal vesicle. These nascent PEX16-containing peroxisomes then import  additional PMPs. The import of  PEX11 proteins allows these  structures to proliferate by fission or by budding, and the import of other peroxins leads to  formation of a functional matrix  protein import apparatus. Under normal conditions, peroxisomes would form primarily  from preexisting peroxisomes in  a PEX11-mediated process. Although the targeting of PEX16 to  preperoxisomal structures may  be enhanced in the absence of  peroxisomal membranes, such a  process may also occur under  normal conditions.</p>
