      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, also known as hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (HMSN),is one of the most common hereditary peripheral neuropathy with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 2500 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The major clinical features of CMT are progressive muscle weakness of distal extremities and sensory loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. According to the clinical symptoms and electrophysiological characteristics, CMT is categorized into type 1 (CMT1) and type 2 (CMT2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. CMT1 is characterized by hypertrophic demyelination with slow nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) (median nerve conduction velocity &lt;38&#xA0;m/s), while CMT2 is characterized by normal or mildly reduced NCVs (median nerve conduction velocity &gt;38&#xA0;m/s) along with axonopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
      <p><italic>MFN2</italic> is located on the short arm of chromosome 1 and encodes mitofusin 2, a GTPase dynamin-like protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane. It plays an essential role in mitochondrial functions including fusion, axonal transport, interoranellar communication and mitophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In previous studies, <italic>MFN2</italic> mutations have been linked to neurological disorders including CMT2 (named as CMT2A2, OMIM#609260). To date, more than 100 <italic>MFN2</italic> mutations have been reported to be associated with CMT2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Among them, there is just one mutation at the 730<sup>th</sup> nucleotide in the encoding region (c.730G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A/p.Val244Met) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>Here, we reported a 4&#xA0;year-old-boy with CMT2 symptoms including muscle weakness, difficulty in running and frequent fall. Targeted next-generation sequencing identified a novel heterozygous mutation c.730G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;C (p.Val244Leu) in <italic>MFN2</italic>, which occurred <italic>de novo</italic>.</p>

      <title>Case presentation</title>
      <p>The patient was a 4-year-old Chinese boy who couldn&#x2019;t stand steadily by himself and had suspicious foot-drop gait. Physical examination revealed atrophy of lower extremities (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). His left foot showed a mild pescavus deformity and could not lift up by himself. There was no strength in his right hand. Testing of the deep-tendon reflexes showed reduced patellar tendon reflex and ankle reflex. There were no Babinski sign, Chaddock sign, Oppenheim sign and Gordon sign. Muscle strength was reduced with MRC scores of IV on lower extremities. The muscular tension was mildly reduced. NCVS showed damage of peripheral nerves.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The lower extremities of the patient</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13052_2016_237_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
      <p>The patient is the third child in his family. His two sisters who are four and two years older were completely healthy. No family history of similar problems was presented. The patient was one of the two twins when his mother was in pregnancy. Unfortunately his twin brother died in the uterus. Since his mother&#x2019;s amniotic fluid broke early, he was born by caesarean with 5.73 pounds in weight. There was no asphyxia at birth. During his growing progress, he could walk at the age of 1&#xA0;year and 7 to 8&#xA0;months albeit not steadily with suspicious foot-drop gait. He was easy to fall when running with progressive aggravation. He had normal intelligence. NCVS showed normal motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) of upper limbs but showed slower sensory nerve conduction velocity (SCV). In addition, neither compound motor action potential (CMAP) or sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) of lower limbs was elicited, indicating that the peripheral nerves of his lower limbs were damaged (Tables&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). When it comes to brain and spinal MRI, the brain MRI image indicates the possibility of periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) while the spinal MRI image shows no apparent abnormality (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). As for lumbar puncture, the cerebrospinal fluid examination results were normal. The leucocyte count was zero, the protein and sugar quantifications were in normal control range and the immunoglobulin quantifications were as well.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>NCVS results (motor nerve conduction velocity)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3">Nerve</th><th rowspan="3">Stimulation site</th><th rowspan="3">Recording site</th><th colspan="4">Latency (mS) &amp; amplitude (mV)</th><th rowspan="3">Conduction velocity (m/s)</th><th rowspan="2" colspan="2">F wave</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2">Proximal muscle</th><th colspan="2">Distal muscle</th></tr><tr><th>(mS)</th><th>(mV)</th><th>(mS)</th><th>(mV)</th><th>mS</th><th>Occurrence rate</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Right median nerve</td><td>Elbow wrist</td><td>Abductor pollicis brevis</td><td>4</td><td>6.3</td><td>2</td><td>6.7</td><td>50</td><td rowspan="2"/><td rowspan="6"/></tr><tr><td>Right ulnar nerve</td><td>Elbow wrist</td><td>Abductor digiti quinti</td><td>3.7</td><td>4.7</td><td>1.83</td><td>4.7</td><td>53.5</td></tr><tr><td>Right tibial nerve</td><td>Popliteal fossa ankle</td><td>Abductor hallucis muscle</td><td>10.8</td><td>0.3</td><td>Not elicited</td><td/><td/><td>Not elicited</td></tr><tr><td>Left tibial nerve</td><td>Popliteal fossa ankle</td><td>Abductor hallucis muscle</td><td>10.7</td><td>0.02</td><td>5.5</td><td>0.02</td><td>29.8</td><td>Not elicited</td></tr><tr><td>Right common peroneal nerve</td><td>Popliteal ankle</td><td>Extensor brevis digitorum</td><td>Not elicited</td><td/><td>Not elicited</td><td/><td/><td rowspan="2"/></tr><tr><td>Left common peroneal nerve</td><td>Popliteal ankle</td><td>Extensor brevis digitorum</td><td>Not elicited</td><td/><td>Not elicited</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>NCVS results (sensory nerve conduction velocity)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Nerve</th><th>Stimulation site</th><th>Recording site</th><th>Latency (mS)</th><th>Amplitude (uV)</th><th>Conduction velocity (m/s)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Right median nerve</td><td>Index finger</td><td>Wrist</td><td>5.8</td><td>5.9</td><td>15.5</td></tr><tr><td>Right ulnar nerve</td><td>Little finger</td><td>Wrist</td><td>2</td><td>42</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Right nervi suralis</td><td>Crus</td><td>Ankle</td><td>Not elicited</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Left nervi suralis</td><td>Crus</td><td>Ankle</td><td>Not elicited</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The brain MRI image of the patient</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13052_2016_237_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
      <p>Since the clinical features of the patient was suspicious of CMT, we sequenced 133 candidate genes for hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (HMSN) and identified a novel heterozygous mutation c.730G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;C (p.Val244Leu) in <italic>MFN2</italic>. This mutation was not present in either of his parents.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p><italic>MFN2</italic> is located on the short arm of chromosome 1. It encodes mitofusin 2, a GTPase dynamin-like protein of the outer mitochondria membrane. <italic>MFN2</italic> has an essential role in mitochondrial functions including fusion, axonal transport, interorganellar communication and mitophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Because mitochondria are crucial organelles present in almost all cells of human body (except erythrocyte) to provide ATP for metabolic processes and oxidative phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], mutations of <italic>MFN2</italic> may cause mitochondria dysfunction and affect high energetic demand tissues. Since the first heterozygous mutation in the <italic>MFN2</italic> has been found by Z&#xFC;chner et al in 2004, more than 100 <italic>MFN2</italic> mutations have been reported to be associated with CMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Based on the existing reports, these mutations can be either gain or loss of function in mitochondria. In some cases, certain <italic>MFN2</italic> mutations are associated with specific clinical features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. c.730G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A (p.Val244Met), a mutation occurring at the same position as the one reported in this study, has been reported to cause CMT2 by K.Kijima et al in 2005. The Japanese kid with the c.730G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A mutation showed CMT2 phenotype with no sensory impairments. The age of onset was 10&#xA0;months and the symptom included walking difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In our study, the patient&#x2019;s symptom at the onset was abnormal gait when he started to walk at the age of 1&#xA0;year and 7 to 8&#xA0;months. Then he showed running difficulties, frequent falls and slowly progressive atrophy of lower legs with a mild deformity at his left foot. On the other side, this boy did have sensory loss at his lower limbs. All of these symptoms agree with CMT phenotypes. Because of his median nerve conduction velocity is 50.0&#xA0;m/s (&gt;38&#xA0;m/s), we classified it as CMT2.</p>
      <p>Based on previously reports and the clinical symptoms of the patient, we believe that the novel <italic>MFN2</italic> mutation identified in this study has a deleterious nature and is the likely cause of CMT2 for the following reasons:. First, the c.730G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;C mutation changes an amino acid from valine to leucine and may affect protein features. Second, p.Val244Leu in <italic>MFN2</italic> was predicted to be disease-causing by all three computational tools (Mutation Taster, PROVEAN and SIFT). Third, this mutation changed an evolutionarily conserved amino acid (Phylop score is 5.51) (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Four, according to previous reports, there is one CMT2A disease causing mutation at the same position (c.730G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A/p.Val244Met). In summary, the <italic>de novo</italic> pattern is consistent with the previously reported autosomal dominant inheritance of CMT2A2.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Multi-species sequence alignment showing the evolutionarily conserved residues of p.V244 in <italic>MFN2</italic>
