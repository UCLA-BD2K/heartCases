      <abstract>
        <p>Alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a hereditary disorder associated with reduced AAT plasma levels, predisposing adults to pulmonary emphysema. The most common genetic AAT variants found in patients are the mildly deficient S and the severely deficient Z alleles, but several other pathogenic rare alleles have been reported. While the plasma AAT deficiency is a common trait of the disease, only a few AAT variants, including the prototypic Z AAT and some rare variants, form cytotoxic polymers in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes and predispose to liver disease. Here we report the identification of three new rare AAT variants associated to reduced plasma levels and characterize their molecular behaviour in cellular models. The variants, called Mpisa (Lys259Ile), Etaurisano (Lys368Glu) and Yorzinuovi (Pro391His), showed reduced secretion compared to control M AAT, and accumulated to different extents in the cells as ordered polymeric structures resembling those formed by the Z variant. Structural analysis of the mutations showed that they may facilitate polymerization both by loosening &#x2018;latch&#x2019; interactions constraining the AAT reactive loop and through effects on core packing. In conclusion, the new AAT deficiency variants, besides increasing the risk of lung disease, may predispose to liver disease, particularly if associated with the common Z variant. The new mutations cluster structurally, thus defining a region of the AAT molecule critical for regulating its conformational state.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder characterized by reduced plasma levels of alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT), the archetypal member of the serpin (<underline>ser</underline>ine <underline>p</underline>rotease <underline>in</underline>hibitor) protein superfamily. An acute phase glycoprotein, AAT is mainly synthesized in the liver and it inhibits neutrophil elastase to regulate inflammatory processes in the circulation and lung tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Silverman1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Stoller1">[2]</xref>. Plasma levels of AAT are tightly linked to variants of the coding gene <italic>SERPINA1</italic> (14q32.1) (OMIM: 107400), which dictate the AAT concentration according to a co-dominant model. Pathogenic alleles of the <italic>SERPINA1</italic> gene are conventionally classified as &#x201C;null&#x201D;, if associated with undetectable AAT, or as &#x201C;deficient&#x201D; alleles if the mutated protein is synthesised and retained in a misfolded state within hepatocytes, resulting in variable degrees of secretion defect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Luisetti1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The commonest deficient variants causing AATD are the S (Glu264Val) and Z (Glu342Lys) mutations. SS genotypes result in mild deficiency, with minimal clinical sequelae. The ZZ and SZ genotypes, associated with 15% and 25% of normal AAT plasma levels, account for the vast majority of severe AATD. However, there are several other pathogenic AAT alleles described, usually referred to as &#x201C;rare alleles&#x201D;, associated with varying degrees of reduced plasma level. The prevalence of these rare AATD genotypes is believed to be more frequent in the Mediterranean area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Denden1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Ferrarotti1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The deficiency of circulating AAT is associated with an increased risk of developing emphysema, due to uncontrolled elastase activity in the lung, which may be exacerbated by additional risk factors such as cigarette smoke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Evans1">[6]</xref>. Besides emphysema, the Z AAT variant also predisposes to liver diseases, which may present in ZZ homozygous individuals as neonatal jaundice, cirrhosis and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Perlmutter1">[7]</xref>. The development of liver disease is caused by excessive accumulation of Z AAT in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of hepatocytes as ordered polymeric structures, which deposit in PAS+, diastase-resistant inclusion bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Lomas1">[8]</xref>. Polymerization of Z AAT proceeds through formation of an unstable monomeric AAT intermediate termed M* <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Dafforn1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Gooptu1">[10]</xref>. This permits a stabilising interaction between two AAT motifs, the reactive loop and beta-sheet A. The latter is opened in M* and insertion of the reactive loop links two AAT molecules into a dimer. Successive intermolecular interactions lengthen this into a polymer chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Gooptu2">[11]</xref>. Currently three models of serpin polymerization are proposed in the literature, all of which conform to these constraints, but differing in the number of beta strands (1, 2, or 3) involved in the intermolecular linkage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Chiou1">[12]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Yamasaki2">[15]</xref>. However all three models incorporate release of strand 1 of beta-sheet C, expansion of beta-sheet A and insertion of reactive loop residues as an extra strand in beta-sheet A. Besides the archetypal Z AAT, other deficiency variants have been shown to form polymers within the ER. While the Z mutation resides in the hinge region at the base of the reactive loop, other strongly polymerizing variants such as Siiyama (Ser52Phe), Mmalton (Phe52del) and King&#x2019;s (His334Asp) carry mutations localized in the shutter region, which directly favour opening of beta-sheet A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Lomas2">[16]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Miranda1">[18]</xref>. The Pbrescia mutation instead perturbs an arginine pocket that normally stabilizes the reactive loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Medicina1">[19]</xref>, and milder polymerizing variants such as I (Arg39Cys) and S (Glu264Val) may act indirectly on beta-sheet A stability by perturbing helix A/G-core packing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Mahadeva1">[20]</xref>. Although the different mutations affect different AAT regions, the resulting polymers are recognised by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for Z AAT polymers, strongly supporting their structural similarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Miranda1">[18]</xref>.</p>

      <p>Here we report the identification and characterization of three novel AAT alleles, Mpisa (Lys259Ile), Etaurisano (Lys368Glu) and Yorzinuovi (Pro391His), associated with reduced concentration of AAT in plasma. The behaviour of the variants when expressed individually in cellular models clearly supports their identification as deficiency alleles, with a range of intracellular polymer loads observed. These mutations cluster structurally and are likely to facilitate polymerization both by effects upon &#x2018;latch&#x2019; interactions constraining the AAT reactive loop and upon core packing.</p>

        <p>The index case carrying the Mpisa AAT allele was 26 years old at the time of diagnosis at the San Matteo Hospital (Pavia, Italy). He had dyspnea and no evidence of liver disease. The index case carrying the Etaurisano AAT allele was 31 years old when he was referred to the San Matteo Hospital (Pavia, Italy) because of panlobular emphysema. The proband with the Yorzinuovi allele was first admitted at the age of 46 at the Gastroenterology department of Spedali Civili (Brescia, Italy) because of a ten year history of mild hyper-transaminasemia. The index case&#x2019;s families were investigated where possible. Collection of blood samples and the genetic investigations were performed after appropriate written informed consent of the subjects involved and approval by the ethical committees of the institutions involved (San Matteo Hospital of Pavia and Spedali Civili of Brescia, Italy). The patients in this manuscript have given written informed consent to publication of their anonymised case details.</p>

        <p>The Mpisa allele is characterized by an A to T transition in exon III (c.848A&gt;T) in the M1Val background, resulting in a Lys259Ile substitution. The Mpisa allele was identified in association with the Z AAT allele in a patient with emphysema and reduced AAT plasma levels (56 mg/dL). Afterwards, other five M/Mpisa unrelated subjects were identified. Their AAT plasma levels (82&#x2013;96 mg/dl) were at the lower limit of normal values <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Zorzetto1">[26]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The Etaurisano allele is characterized by a transversion in AAT exon V (c.1174 A&gt;G) resulting in Lys368Glu substitution. It was first identified in a subject with panlobular emphysema, in the heterozygous state with the M allele. It was then found in the index case&#x2019;s father and brother (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038405-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Cloning and sequencing of exon V indicated that the Etaurisano mutation arose on the M2 background allele.</p>

        <title>Reduced Secretion of the Newly Identified Variants by Hepa 1.6 Hepatoma Cells</title>
        <p>We investigated the molecular behaviour of the novel AATD-associated variants by expressing them in liver-derived cells (Hepa1.6) and performing pulse-chase experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038405-g002">Figure 2</xref>). As controls we included M and Z AAT, as well as Mwurzburg (Pro369Ser), a previously described AAT deficiency variant whose amino acid substitution occurs next to that of Etaurisano <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Poller1">[28]</xref>. As expected, the newly synthesized M AAT was present at the end of the pulse period in the NP40-soluble cell fraction as a single band of about 50 kD, which corresponds to the high mannose intermediate form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038405-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, arrowhead). During the chase period, the protein is converted to a fully glycosylated mature protein (approx. 54 kD) that is rapidly secreted into the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038405-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, arrow). Only a small amount of M AAT was transiently found as immature polypeptide in the NP40-insoluble cell fraction. On the other hand, the newly synthesized Z protein was mainly retained in the cells as immature and significantly accumulated in the NP40-insoluble fractions, confirming its tendency to form large insoluble complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038405-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The novel variants showed a reduction of protein secretion and were found in the NP40-insoluble fraction, suggesting that they formed large insoluble intracellular complexes similarly to Z AAT, although to different extents. The AAT distribution at different time points in the intracellular soluble and insoluble fractions, as well as in the cell media, was quantified by densitometry and expressed as percentages of the total AAT amount found at time 0 of chase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038405-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). At 240 min of chase, when about 78% of the wild-type M is found in the culture medium, the different mutants show reduced secretion (Z 16%, Mwurzburg 27%, Etaurisano 52%, Mpisa 22% and Yorzinuovi 11%). At the same time point, when the wild-type M is undetectable in the NP40-insoluble fraction, all the mutants show an accumulation of detergent insoluble complexes (Z 21%, Mwurzburg 13%, Etaurisano 13%, Mpisa 13% and Yorzinuovi 43%).</p>
        <p>The secretion efficiency of the variants was also evaluated at steady state by quantitative dot-blot analysis of the AAT found in cell culture media of transfected Hepa1.6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038405-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Panel A represents a single experiment comparing the different mutant variants and the M, Z and Null-hongkong (Null-hk) controls, using serial dilutions of commercial purified AAT (Sigma) as reference. Quantitative densitometric analysis of dot blots from three independent transfection experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038405-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) confirmed the results of the pulse chase experiments showing that the new deficiency variants all behave as defective in Hepa 1.6 cells, the Yorzinuovi being the most severely deficient (below 10% of M AAT).</p>

        <title>Formation of Polymers by the Alpha1-antitrypsin Variants in Transfected COS-7 Cells</title>
        <p>The finding that the new variants accumulated as large NP40-insoluble complexes in Hepa 1.6 cells prompted us to investigate whether their accumulation occurs in the form of ordered polymers, similarly to Z AAT. We assessed the presence of AAT polymers in cell lysates and culture media from COS-7 cells transiently expressing the variants by non-denaturing PAGE and immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038405-g004">Figure 4</xref>). As expected, M AAT was found at low levels within the cells and was secreted in the cell medium exclusively in the monomeric form. Z AAT instead was found mainly as polymers both in the cell lysate and in the medium. Similarly, polymeric AAT was found in both the cell lysates and media of the cells expressing the new variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038405-g004">Figure 4</xref>, middle panels). Variable proportions of the monomer and polymer forms are detected for the different AAT variants, in correlation with their propensity to polymerize. This is consistent with previous studies on alpha1-antitrypsin and neuroserpin mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Miranda1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Miranda2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Miranda3">[29]</xref>. The Mwurzburg and Etaurisano variants displayed a higher percentage in the monomeric form, in agreement with their milder defect in secretion. Based on our results, we cannot determine whether the polymers found in the cell media are formed extracellularly, secreted from the cells or both. The polymeric forms were all recognised by the polymer specific mAb 2C1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Miranda1">[18]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038405-g004">Figure 4</xref>, bottom panels), suggesting that the polymers formed by the new variants of AAT structurally resemble those formed by Z AAT.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study we report three new AAT deficiency variants, bearing non-conservative aminoacid substitutions, that we named Mpisa (Lys259Ile), Etaurisano (Lys368Glu), and Yorzinuovi (Pro391His). These variants were identified in Italian patients with reduced serum AAT levels. The previously reported variant Mwurzburg was included in our study because the causative mutation (Pro369Ser) affects the adjacent residue to that affected in Etaurisano (Lys368Glu). Moreover, this variant is represented in the Italian cohort of AATD patients with rare alleles (LC and ML, unpublished data) and allows us a further correlation between mutations in this region and cell model data. We studied both intracellular accumulation and defective secretion of AAT in our cell models since these respectively relate to the major pathogenic drivers of the liver and lung disease associated with AAT deficiency.</p>
      <p>The new variants show a secretion defect in Hepa cells, the Yorzinuovi being the most severely deficient. These in vitro results are fully consistent with the plasma levels observed in the carriers, while clinical evidence of lung disease was established only in some patients. The onset of emphysema indeed depends on several risk factors, particularly cigarette smoke, as widely documented for Z homozygous individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Evans1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We also evaluated the tendency of the different variants to form ordered polymers when expressed in transfected Hepa and COS cells. The higher tendency to form polymers was displayed by Yorzinuovi, which explains its severe secretory defect. Based on the recognition by the 2C1 polymer-specific monoclonal antibody, the structure of the polymers formed by the new variants resembles that of Z. The index case carrying the Yorzinuovi allele in association with the wild-type M allele was referred because of persistently elevated transaminases, although no AAT inclusions were evidenced by immunohistochemical analysis on liver biopsy, while the two other carriers of this allele were fully asymptomatic. This mild phenotype may be related to the heterozygote state of the carriers. Similarly the MZ phenotype is not associated with severe lung or liver disease. Indeed, even the ZZ phenotype is associated with a wide spectrum of liver disease: from disease-free to end-stage hepatic failure or malignancy. Thus the risk of liver disease from intrahepatocytic polymerization is modified by further genetic and environmental factors, only partially elucidated.</p>
      <p>Sequence alignment of different serpins revealed that the aminoacids mutated in the Etaurisano, Mwurzburg and Yorzinuovi are in a highly conserved C-terminal region, likely to be important for the structural stability of serpins. Consistently, other natural mutations leading to plasma deficiency have been reported to affect this region. The Pro391His mutation was previously found in association with the Asp256Val mutation in the Ybarcelona AAT variant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Jardi1">[27]</xref>. Pro369 is also mutated in the Mheerlen AAT deficient variant (Pro369Leu) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Poller1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Kim1">[34]</xref>. Moreover, the Pro476Ser substitution in the C1 inhibitor (equivalent to Pro391 in the AAT) was previously reported to promote intracellular multimerization, causing reduced plasma levels and angioedema <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Eldering1">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The crucial role of the C-terminal AAT region is strengthened by our structural analysis aimed at predicting the possible effects of the mutations underlying intracellular accumulation and polymer formation. The mutations highlight the structural significance of the gate region of AAT, where a network of hydrophobic interactions fasten the lateral border of &#x3B2;-sheet C to close a &#x3B2;-barrel motif with &#x3B2;-sheet B. Since these interactions keep the gate region closed in the native structure we propose they be termed &#x2018;latch&#x2019; interactions. Loosening these interactions will favour &#x2018;unlatching&#x2019; of the gate and population of the polymerogenic intermediate M* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038405-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). An opened gate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Wardell1">[31]</xref> and untethered s1C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Chang1">[36]</xref> have both previously been proposed as requirements for conformational change in the serpin superfamily. The new mutations show these are likely intrinsically coupled during intracellular polymerisation. The network of latch interactions also explains the elegant systematic mutagenesis study of Pro391 carried out almost two decades ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Brodbeck1">[37]</xref>. Mutation to hydrophobic residues had minimal effects on secretion and degradation profiles. However as mutations became increasingly hydrophilic, intracellular retention within the ER and/or degradation increased to give phenotypes more marked than the Z variant.</p>
      <p>The mutations also highlight the significance of packing interactions between &#x3B1;-helices A and G and &#x3B2;-sheet B within the core of the molecule. Destabilisation of such interactions and consequent dysregulation of &#x3B2;-sheet A opening has been postulated as the mechanism by which the S (Glu264Val) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Elliott1">[38]</xref> and I (Arg39Cys) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Mahadeva1">[20]</xref> mutations cause polymerisation and mild plasma deficiency. The Mpisa (Lys259Ile) mutation will affect G-helix packing whilst the linker preceding the G-helix will be destabilised by the Etaurisano (Lys368Glu) mutation. Formation of the intermediate state in either the single strand (&#x2018;classical&#x2019; loop-sheet model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Chiou1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Ekeowa1">[13]</xref>) or triple strand (C-terminal derived <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Yamasaki2">[15]</xref>) linkage models of serpin polymerization are highly consistent with direct coupling of s1C release with intramolecular loop insertion. Both of these models are therefore similarly compatible with the finding that gate loosening and/or core disrupting mutations result in increased polymerization and mild deficiency. In contrast, gate opening does not appear integral to the 2 strand (beta-hairpin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038405-Yamasaki1">[14]</xref>) model. It seems less likely that the &#x2018;latch&#x2019; mutations we describe would trigger polymer formation by this mechanism. Further structural studies will be required to establish whether the novel variants populate extensively unfolded intermediates in the disease state, as proposed in the triple-strand model, or favour more parsimonious conformational change, consistent with single-strand linkage. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the new AAT deficiency variants, besides increasing the risk of lung disease, may predispose to liver disease, particularly if associated with Z or with a different polymerogenic variant. Together the novel mutations define a latch region that regulates the population of an M* state. Polymerogenic mutations here will promote conformational change by favouring s1C release and/or effects upon core packing.</p>
