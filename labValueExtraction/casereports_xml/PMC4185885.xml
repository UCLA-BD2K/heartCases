      <abstract>
        <p>Carcinoembryonic antigen glypican-3 (GPC3) is expressed by &gt;40% of ovarian clear cell carcinoma (CCC) and is a promising immunotherapeutic target. We previously reported the safety of and immunological and clinical responses to a GPC3-derived peptide vaccine in a phase I clinical trial of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although the efficacy of the GPC3-derived peptide vaccine against HCC patients was evaluated, other GPC3-positive cancer patients have not yet been investigated. Therefore, we conducted a phase II trial to evaluate the clinical outcome of ovarian CCC patients treated with a GPC3-derived peptide vaccine. The GPC3 peptide was administered at a dose of 3 mg per body. Patients received an intradermal injection of the GPC3 peptide emulsified with incomplete Freund&#x2019;s adjuvant. Vaccinations were performed biweekly from the first until the 6th injection and were then repeated at 6-week intervals after the 7th injection. Treatment continued until disease progression. We herein present two patients with chemotherapy-refractory ovarian CCC who achieved a significant clinical response in an ongoing trial of a GPC3 peptide vaccine. Case 1, a 42-year-old patient with advanced recurrent ovarian CCC with liver and retroperitoneal lymph node metastases, received the HLA-A24-restricted GPC3 peptide vaccine. Contrast-enhanced CT at week 10 revealed a partial response (PR) using RECIST criteria. Case 2 was a 67-year-old female with multiple lymph node metastases. She was injected with the HLA-A2-restricted GPC3 peptide vaccine. According to RECIST, PR was achieved at week 37. The stabilization of their diseases over one year provided us with the first clinical evidence to demonstrate that GPC3 peptide-based immunotherapy may significantly prolong the overall survival of patients with refractory ovarian CCC.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancy. Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (CCC) accounts for 5&#x2013;25% of all EOC, depending on the geographic location. It accounts for &lt;10% of all EOC diagnosed in the USA.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> In contrast, the incidence of CCC is reportedly &gt;15% of EOC in Japan.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Compared with other EOC subtypes, CCC is associated with a poorer prognosis and increased chemoresistance.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> In particular, the response rate of recurrent CCC to salvage chemotherapy was reported to be less than 10%.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Progression-free survival was also less than 6 mo, even in patients who achieved a response when treated with conventional anti-cancer cytotoxic agents.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> The long-term clinical outcome of patients with recurrent CCC is extremely poor.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Therefore, new treatment modalities are urgently required for patients with CCC refractory to chemotherapy.</p>
      <p>Immunotherapy is a potentially attractive option for EOC. Glypican-3 (GPC3) is useful not only as a novel tumor marker, but also as an oncofetal antigen for immunotherapy. It is specifically overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Previous studies demonstrated that GPC3 was also overexpressed in several malignant tumors, including ovarian CCC.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>-</sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>
      <p>We previously identified the HLA-A24-restricted GPC3<sub>298&#x2013;306</sub> (EYILSLEEL) and HLA-A2-restricted GPC3<sub>144&#x2013;152</sub> (FVGEFFTDV) peptides, both of which can induce GPC3-reactive cytotoxic T cells (CTLs).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> We recently reported the safety of and immunological and clinical responses to a GPC3-derived peptide vaccine in a phase I trial for advanced HCC patients.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> We are currently conducting a phase II trial with a GPC3-derived peptide vaccine in ovarian CCC patients (UMIN-CTR: 000003696).</p>

        <title>Patient eligibility</title>
        <p>This study describes two patients from our GPC3 peptide vaccination trial. This clinical trial was approved and monitored by the Institutional Review Board at Nagoya University School of Medicine. Patients with progressive metastatic ovarian CCC were enrolled after providing written, informed consent. The following eligibility criteria were used: diagnosis of ovarian CCC on the basis of histological examinations; no expectation of a response to other therapies; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0&#x2013;2; age between 20 and 80 y; HLA-A24- or HLA-A2-positive status as determined using commercially available genomic DNA typing tests; and adequate organ function (white blood cell count &#x2265;2000/mm<sup>3</sup>, platelets &#x2265;50&#x2009;000/mm<sup>3</sup>, serum creatinine &#x2264;2.1 mg/dl, total bilirubin &#x2264;3.6 mg/dl, aspartate aminotransferase &#x2264;165 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase &#x2264;1795 IU/L). The following exclusion criteria were applied: other active malignancies; clinically serious infection; active gastrointestinal bleeding; severe cardiac insufficiency; severe interstitial pneumonitis; massive ascites and/or hydrothorax; concurrent treatment with steroids or immunosuppressive agents; and unsuitability for the trial based on a clinical judgment.</p>

        <title>Case 1</title>
        <p>A 42-y-old nulligravid Japanese female was referred to us in November 2011. She had been diagnosed with an ovarian tumor when she presented with bilateral lower extremity deep vein thrombosis. She had undergone laparotomy including total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and sampling of the pelvic lymph nodes at a nearby hospital in August 2010. There were residual tumors of peritoneal dissemination and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Histopathology revealed ovarian CCC and the presence of pelvic lymph node metastases. Therefore, her initial clinical stage was IIIC. She was treated postoperatively with six cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin (TC) chemotherapy. After TC chemotherapy, she once again underwent laparotomy including omentectomy and pelvic and para-aortic systemic lymphadenectomy in March 2011, and a complete response was achieved. The histology of the resected tumor revealed retroperitoneal lymph node metastases, and no pathological chemotherapeutic effects were observed. Thus, she received four cycles of postoperative chemotherapy with irinotecan and cisplatin. CT scans revealed the enlargement of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes and calyx of the right kidney in August 2011. The multiple metastases rapidly progressed, and oral opioids were administered to relieve back pain.</p>
        <p>After confirming her HLA type as HLA- A*24:02, she was enrolled in a phase II trial of the GPC3 peptide vaccination. She began receiving intradermal injections of 3 mg of HLA-A24-restricted GPC3<sub>298&#x2013;306</sub> GMP grade peptide emulsified with incomplete Freund&#x2019;s adjuvant in November 2011. Vaccinations were performed biweekly from the first until the 6th injection and were repeated at 6-wk intervals after the 7th injection according to the trial schedule.</p>
        <p>Pretreatment tumor markers were as follows: CA125, 405.4 U/ml and CA72-4, 264.1 U/ml. The serum levels of these tumor markers decreased after the initiation of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.&#xA0;1A</xref>). The pretreatment serum GPC3 protein (17.3 ng/ml) was detectable, but changes in the serum levels of GPC3 unlike other tumor markers had been broadly flat while there was an increase or decrease (data not shown). Liver and para-aortic lymph node metastases grew during the first few weeks before tumor regression. According to RECIST, PR was achieved at week 10. Oral opioids were discontinued. Right hydronephrosis, pleural effusion, and ascites disappeared. Liver and para-aortic lymph node metastases were no longer visible on contrast-enhanced CT after 23 wk of exposure to the vaccine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.&#xA0;1B</xref>). However, we observed the slow growth of the bilateral inguinal lymph nodes during the same period. Therefore, right inguinal lymph node resection biopsy was performed at week 25. A histological examination of the biopsied specimen revealed the metastasis of CCC. Immunohistochemical staining was performed with monoclonal antibodies against GPC3, HLA class I, and CD8. Immunohistochemical staining revealed the expression of GPC3 and HLA class I in the cytoplasm and membranes of carcinoma cells and a few CD8-positive T cells in the primary ovarian CCC tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.&#xA0;1C</xref>), whereas most CCC cells in the resected right inguinal lymph node metastasis appeared to lack GPC3 expression, showed a reduction in the expression of HLA class I, and there was little infiltration of CD8-positive T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.&#xA0;1D</xref>).</p>

        <title>Case 2</title>
        <p>A 67-y-old parous Japanese female was referred to our hospital in March 2012. She had undergone laparotomy including total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and sampling of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes in September 2010. Residual enlarged right common iliac and para-aortic lymph nodes were noted. A histological examination showed ovarian CCC. Her initial clinical stage was IIIC due to retroperitoneal lymph node metastases. She was treated postoperatively with nine cycles of weekly TC chemotherapy. Pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes persisted following weekly TC chemotherapy and increased in size. Two subsequent regimens yielded no response: three cycles of second-line chemotherapy with irinotecan and nedaplatin, and one cycle with gemcitabine and docetaxel as third-line chemotherapy.</p>
        <p>She had the HLA-A*02:01 genotype, and began receiving 3 mg of the HLA-A2-restricted GPC3<sub>144-152</sub> peptide vaccine in April 2012. Pretreatment tumor markers were as follows: CA19-9, 241 U/ml and CA125, 9.8 U/ml. The serum levels of these tumor markers decreased after the 7th vaccination. CA19-9 levels had decreased to within the normal range by week 43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.&#xA0;2A</xref>). The serum GPC3 protein was undetectable.</p>

        <p>She achieved stable disease except for Virchow's node by week 24. However, she showed PR at week 37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.&#xA0;2B</xref>). The response resulted in almost the complete resolution of all measurable lesions on plain CT. Unfortunately, she had a past history of allergies to CT contrast media; therefore, we performed <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT to improve the diagnostic accuracy of residual tumors at week 49. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT showed mild positive FDG uptake in four masses (smaller than 1 cm in size) in the right common iliac lymph node and intraperitoneal dissemination. Although <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET did not always reflect malignancy or detect metastatic lesions, the presence of residual tumors was still suspected.</p>
        <p>Because she remained progression free at week 74, she is still receiving the trial treatment. The expression of HLA class I was positive, while that of GPC3 was not positive in the primary ovarian CCC tissue, and there was no infiltration of CD8-positive T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.&#xA0;2C</xref>).</p>
        <p>No adverse effects of the vaccination were observed in either case, except for a local inflammatory response with erythema at the injection site and low-grade fever.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Most gynecological oncologists are aware that recurrent or persistent ovarian CCC has a chemoresistant phenotype. Although the different histological types of EOC may represent different diseases with unique clinical and molecular characteristics, ovarian CCC is still currently being treated in the same manner as other EOCs because of its low rate of incidence among EOCs in western countries. Novel treatment approaches should be adopted for ovarian CCC, especially in cases that are recurrent or refractory to previous therapies. Between 5 and 10% of all currently open clinical trials for ovarian cancer patients evaluate approaches using immune-based therapies. Although most immunotherapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer treatment investigated so far are capable of inducing antigen-specific immunity, the unequivocal clinical benefit for these patients has not yet been demonstrated.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> To date, we have confirmed that a HLA-A2-restricted GPC3<sub>144&#x2013;152</sub> peptide-specific CTL clone can recognize and kill HLA-A2-positive and GPC3-positive ovarian CCC cell lines.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Based on these conditions, we conducted a trial to assess the clinical outcome of ovarian CCC patients treated with a GPC3-derived peptide vaccine. In the ongoing clinical trial, 20 refractory patients were enrolled until the end of August 2013. Ten of these patients were vaccinated at least six times, and a significant clinical response was achieved in two patients (2/10, 20%) who received the HLA-A24 or A2-restricted GPC3 peptide vaccine. In spite of resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs, the stabilization of their diseases over one year suggests the efficacy of the GPC3 peptide vaccination.</p>
      <p>Two patterns of responses, fast and slow, after the initial increase in the total tumor burden were observed in this study. In case 1, a fast response was preceded by an apparent early enlargement in liver and para-aortic lymph node metastases. Metastases were stable for several months in case 2 after beginning the vaccination treatment, except for Virchow&#x2019;s node, which showed radiographical progression; however, all radiographically measurable metastases thereafter almost completely regressed. We hypothesize that the immune response elicited during the first several weeks of vaccination, similarly to ipilimumab,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> may be mistaken for progressive disease: CTL infiltration and immune-mediated inflammation may not be radiographically distinguishable from a growing tumor. The initial tumor enlargement was suspected to be caused by inflammation. Meanwhile, bilateral inguinal lymph node metastases grew without reductions within the same patient in case 1. Disease progression may occur as part of a &#x201C;mixed response&#x201D;, i.e., the regression of some lesions and apparent progression of others.</p>
      <p>The difference in effectiveness may have been caused by the heterogeneity associated with immune-escape mechanisms, including the downregulation of cancer-specific antigens and/or HLA class I in tumor cells. The intratumor heterogeneity of GPC3 expression was observed at different levels in our preliminary study depending on the locations and timing of biopsies. Although no correlation was observed between the degree of GPC3 expression and GPC3<sub>298&#x2013;306</sub> peptide-specific CTL response, GPC3 expression in bilateral inguinal lymph node metastasis in case 1 may be associated with the clinical benefits of GPC3 peptide vaccine therapy. On the other hand, we were unable to perform biopsies of retroperitoneal lymph node metastases in case 2. Therefore, further pathological analysis was limited. Although GPC3 immunohistological expression was negative in part of the primary ovarian CCC tissue, its expression may be positive in other parts of the tumor. It may be difficult to predict the clinical response against metastatic tumors based on the strength of GPC3 expression in the primary tumor.</p>
      <p>In a phase I trial of GPC3-derived peptide vaccination, while GPC3 immunohistological expression was detected in more than 80% of advanced HCC patients, pretreatment serum GPC3 protein was detectable in only approximately half of those patients. Unlike case 1, the serum GPC3 protein in case 2 was undetectable by ELISA using a monoclonal antibody (clone 1G12) and sheep polyclonal antibody. Delayed clinical response may have been due to lower expression of GPC3 than the detection limit of assays using clone 1G12 in metastatic sites.</p>
      <p>Ex vivo IFN-&#x3B3; ELISPOT analysis in these two cases revealed vaccine-induced immune reactivity against the GPC3 peptide (data not shown). Although we were unable to discuss whether there were any differences in the quantity or quality of the responses between the two cases because the number of PBMCs plated per well did not correspond, there were more GPC3 peptide-specific CTL spots and less non-specific background spots in case 2 than in case 1.</p>
      <p>It is difficult to confirm whether tumor regression was actually induced by peptide-specific CTLs or other mechanisms. As one of several possibilities, antigen spreading may have occurred following the GPC3 peptide-specific CTL response after the vaccination and contributed decisively to tumor regression.</p>
      <p>Although many clinical trials have been conducted with cancer peptide vaccines, none of these have succeeded in Phase 3. The development of a biomarker to select potential responders would contribute significantly to potential success in a Phase 3 trial. In an effort to identify such biomarkers, we consider it possible to predict a response based on HLA class I/peptide complex expression on the cell surface in prevaccine biopsy specimens. Thus, we have attempted to prepare monoclonal antibodies against the HLA-A24/GPC3<sub>298-306</sub> peptide complex and HLA-A2/GPC3<sub>144-152</sub> peptide complex. Further analyses are needed in the future.</p>
      <p>These results provide the first clinical evidence to demonstrate that GPC3 peptide-based immunotherapy is a promising treatment for patients with ovarian CCC. The complexity of the immune response and impact of each individual patient&#x2019;s status on the immune system create challenges for predicting the time course of the response. Ongoing and future trials will yield information on the best clinical use of this vaccine and the most appropriate method for assessing the response.</p>
