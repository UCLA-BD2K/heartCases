          <p>A 77-year old male presented with ocular pain, conjunctival injection, and severe loss of vision in his left eye. His best corrected visual acuity was hand movements in the left eye, and slit-lamp examination showed a corneal ulcer with feathery margin and hypopyon. Bacterial and fungal smear/culture showed no organism, and there was no improvement in spite of treatment with topical fortified 5% cefazolin and 2% tobramycin. Trichophyton species was identified by repeated cultures. We found onychomycosis on the patient&#x2019;s foot, where the same fungal species were identified. Regimen was changed to topical itraconazole and systemic intravenous itraconazole. No clinical improvement was observed, so therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty and cryotherapy was done with continuation of antifungal therapy. The graft was clear at postoperative 1&#xA0;month and no evidence of recurrence was found.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Fungal keratitis has been reported to be infected by fungi that are present on the surface of the eye as normal flora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Fungal keratitis is often refractory to the anti-fungal treatment. Fungal keratitis, which is difficult to treat, can result in corneal blindness requiring penetrating keratoplasty and in fungal endothalmitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It is important to identify the pathogen of keratitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The most common pathogens of fungal keratitis are Candida albicans and Fusarium species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], although the prevalent species differ in different geographical areas of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Trichophyton is a wide distributed species of dermatophyte and a common pathogen of tinea capitis, flavus, and onychomycosis in dermatologic area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], even though Trichophyton keratitis is not common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Early identification of pathogen causing keratitis provides the appropriate treatment in early phase of keratitis, resulting in better prognosis. Recently, we experienced a case of fungal keratitis and onychomycosis simultaneously infected by Trichophyton. We report the Trichophyton keratitis associated with onychomycosis.</p>

      <title>Case presentation</title>
      <p>A 77-year old male was referred to our clinic with ocular pain, conjunctival injection, and severe loss of vision in his left eye. His eye symptoms had started 3&#xA0;weeks ago spontaneously. He had been treated with topical fortified 5% cefazolin and 2% tobramycin alternately 4 times a day for 4&#xA0;days, but symptoms had not improved after treatment. He had a history of type II diabetes mellitus for 8&#xA0;years, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pneumothorax. He underwent cataract surgeries in both of his eyes. At the first visit, his best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/40 in the right eye and hand movements in the left eye. The intraocular pressure was 20&#xA0;mmHg in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination showed a corneal epithelial defect, stromal infiltration (5 &#xD7; 4&#xA0;mm) with feathery margins and hypopyon (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). Corneal scrapings were taken immediately for smears and culture. Because the lesions progressed in spite of the fortified 5% cefazolin and 2% tobramycin, topical 1% voriconazole was administered every 2&#xA0;hours, and itraconazole 200&#xA0;mg orally twice a day was prescribed. Intrastromal and intracameral injection of voriconazole (50&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/0.1&#xA0;mL) was performed total 5 times every 4&#xA0;days.Fungal hyphae were observed in KOH-stained corneal specimen stained on microscopic examination. Fungal culture on Sabouraud dextrose agar identified Trichophyton species after 7&#xA0;days of incubation. We inspected the patient&#x2019;s body for other fungal skin infection, and found onychomycosis on the patient&#x2019;s foot. The patient had suffered from foot onychomycosis for 10&#xA0;years. Trichophyton, which was the same species causing the fungal keratitis, was identified on culture of nail. The treatment regimen was changed to topical 1% itraconazole every 2&#xA0;hours and 200&#xA0;mg of systemic itraconazole intravenously every 12&#xA0;hours. In spite of the treatment, no clinical improvement was observed for 4&#xA0;days and the corneal infiltrate worsened (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). Therefore, therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty and cryotherapy was done. Many fungal hyphae and yeast forms in severe chronic active inflammation was found in the surgical specimens under microscopic examination with methenamine silver nitrate (MSN) staining (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Topical natamycin per 2&#xA0;hours, moxifloxacin per 6&#xA0;hours, and oral terbinafine (250&#xA0;mg, once a day) was prescribed for postoperative management.Four days after the penetrating keratoplasty, the corneal graft was clear with moderate cellular inflammatory reaction in the anterior chamber (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). Patient was discharged and treated with topical natamycin and oral terbinafine for 8&#xA0;weeks after surgery. The graft was clear with no anterior chamber cellular reaction at postoperative 1&#xA0;month (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). His visual acuity was &#x201C;counting finger&#x201D; at 50&#xA0;cm distance in the right eye and there was no evidence of recurrence.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Fungal keratitis is difficult to diagnose and treat because fungi often proliferate rapidly, cause severe stromal necrosis and enter the anterior chamber by penetrating an intact Descemet&#x2019;s membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In this case, we report the first case of keratitis and onychomycosis infected by Trichophyton species simultaneously. Although Mohammad et al. reported 5 cases of Trichophyton fungal keratitis, none of the patients has been reported to have the concurrent mycotic skin diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The ocular involvement can be caused by spreading from an adjacent skin lesion or from a distant infected source outside the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In this case, the patient had suffered from onychomycosis in his foot for 10&#xA0;years. The organism of his onychomycosis was Trichophyton, which was the same organism causing keratitis. His keratitis can be the secondary infection from his onychomycosis. A case of simultaneous infection of fungal keratitis and onychomycosis by cryptococcus laurentii has been reported and the spread of cryptococcus laurentii from onychomycosis has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>Trichophyton species has been reported to secrete collagenase specific for human-native collagen and gelatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Trichophyton species have dozens subtypes although T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes are common pathogens of onychomycosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In this case, the type of Trichophyton species was not identified. Through the expression an extracellular collagenase with keratinolytic potential, Trichophyton species can cause a severe stromalysis leading to the loss of vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Rapid diagnosis and aggressive medical treatment is of most importance to preserve the vision and have better therapeutic results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Shenoy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] reported a case of Trichophyton keratitis that was not responding to 5% natamycin and treated with topical 2% fluconazole. Mohammad et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] reported 5 cases that were sensitive to topical natamycin although they did not respond to both amphotericin B and miconazole. Our case did not respond to topical natamycin and oral terbinafine. Thus, the patient underwent penetrating keratoplasty and fungal keratitis did not recur.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, it is important to identify the pathogen of keratitis because early identification of pathogen causing keratitis provides the appropriate treatment in early phase of keratitis. It is necessary to search for other fungal skin infections such as onychomycosis and athelete&#x2019;s foot considering the fungal keratitis following skin infection. In addition, fungal skin infection including onychomycosis should be treated for prevention of fungal keratitis as soon as possible.</p>
