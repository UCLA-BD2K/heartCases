        <p>BACKGROUND: We report a case of symptomatic actinomycosis associated with vaginal suture erosion and granulation tissue refractory to conservative management, in an outpatient setting. CASE: Three months after total vaginal hysterectomy and uterosacral ligament vaginal vault suspension, a woman complained of painless, intermittent vaginal discharge and spotting. Despite cauterization of granulation tissue, vaginal spotting persisted for another month. On re-examination, braided polyester suture that was found underlying the granulation tissue was removed. Recurrent symptoms, together with a biopsy revealing actinomycetes, prompted a trial of oral penicillin VK. With persistent symptoms and discomfort during attempts in the outpatient clinic, the woman eventually required suture removal in the operating room. Her symptoms subsequently resolved without recurrence, and no further antibiotic treatment was required. CONCLUSIONS: Actinomyces may be associated with persistent granulation tissue and vault suspension suture material. In rare circumstances, when tissue debridement and suture removal in the clinic is unsatisfactory, surgical intervention in the operating room may be necessary. Ten days of antibiotic therapy alone did not eradicate the granulation tissue, and symptoms resolved only after complete removal of the underlying permanent suture.</p>
