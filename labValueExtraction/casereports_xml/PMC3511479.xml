      <abstract>
        <p>Tricuspid Atresia (TA) is a rare form of congenital heart disease (CHD) with usually poor prognosis in humans. It presents as a complete absence of the right atrio-ventricular connection secured normally by the tricuspid valve. Defects in the tricuspid valve are so far not associated with any genetic locus, although mutations in numerous genes were linked to multiple forms of congenital heart disease. In the last decade, Knock-out mice have offered models for cardiologists and geneticists to study the causes of congenital disease. One such model was the <italic>Nfatc1</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice embryos which die at mid-gestation stage due to a complete absence of the valves. NFATC1 belongs to the Rel family of transcription factors members of which were shown to be implicated in gene activation, cell differentiation, and organogenesis. We have previously shown that a tandem repeat in the intronic region of <italic>NFATC1</italic> is associated with ventricular septal defects. In this report, we unravel for the first time a potential link between a mutation in <italic>NFATC1</italic> and TA. Two heterozygous missense mutations were found in the <italic>NFATC1</italic> gene in one indexed-case out of 19 patients with TA. The two amino-acids changes were not found neither in other patients with CHDs, nor in the control healthy population. Moreover, we showed that these mutations alter dramatically the normal function of the protein at the cellular localization, DNA binding and transcriptional levels suggesting they are disease-causing.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cardiac valvulogenesis refers to the formation of valves in the heart, an evolutionary conserved mechanism in vertebrates that occurs at mid-gestation and results in the unidirectional flow of blood throughout the heart. Both the semilunar (aortic and pulmonary), and atrioventricular valves (tricuspid and mitral) are thought to arise from endocardial cells that undergo multiple processes governed by an array of growth factors, transcription factors, and extracellular proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Wirrig1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Chakraborty1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Armstrong1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Endocardial cells destined to become valves undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transformation (EMT) upon their stimulation by the TGF&#x3B2; and BMP2/4 growth factors secreted from the underlying myocardium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Chakraborty1">[2]</xref>. This process of transformation is dependent on two signaling pathways from within the endocardial cells, specifically the Wnt and NOTCH pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Beis1">[4]</xref>. The mesenchymal cells will invade the cardiac jelly composed mainly of hyaluronic acid. These cells will undergo proliferation and subsequent differentiation into mature valves, a process that is subject to tight regulation by growth factors amongst which the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The final valve structure is made up of at least 2 leaflets (mitral has 2 while tricuspid has 3) composed mainly of endocardially-derived cells. The involvement of neural crest cells in semilunar but not atrioventricular valves formation is supported by conditional knock-outs although neither myocardial nor neural crests cells are detected in the mature valves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Chakraborty1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Armstrong1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Jain1">[5]</xref>. The final process of remodeling is governed mainly by apoptosis. Defects in any of the steps involved in valvulogenesis lead to the valvular congenital heart disease including Mitral and Tricuspid Atresia (MA and TA). These two conditions, which account for 1&#x2013;2% of all congenital heart disease in humans, are still difficult to treat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Hoffman1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Nabulsi1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Some of the molecular pathways involved in valve formation have been unraveled through the unexpected phenotype encountered in mice lacking the <italic>Nfatc1</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-delaPompa1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Ranger1">[9]</xref>. NFATC1 (<underline>N</underline>uclear <underline>F</underline>actor for <underline>A</underline>ctivated <underline>T</underline>-<underline>C</underline>ells) belongs to the Rel/NF-kB family of transcription factors that were first described as being key regulators of T-cells' activation. Five members (NFATC1-5) are found in mammals; all playing different non-redundant roles during embryonic and postnatal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Northrop1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Park1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Horsley1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Crabtree1">[13]</xref>. All five members share a conserved DNA-binding domain at the C-terminus of the protein that binds specifically to the consensus (A/T)<named-content content-type="gene">GGAAA</named-content> sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Crabtree2">[14]</xref>. In addition, they harbor at the N-terminal region a series of conserved serine-proline residues (S/P) that when dephosphorylated unmasked a nuclear localization signal allowing the translocation of NFATC proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Rao1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Masuda1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Chin1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Molkentin1">[18]</xref>. All NFATC proteins except NFATC5 are dephosphorylated by the calcium dependent phosphatase calcineurin (PPP3CA/PPP3CB) at the N-terminus triggering the translocation process. Although NFATC proteins are weak transactivators, their transcriptional potency is boosted through their interactions with different classes of transcription factors mainly the AP-1 family members, c-Fos and Jun, the MADS family, and the GATA zinc finger proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Nemer1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Wada1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Wisniewska1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Ikeda1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Olson1">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>NFATC1 was shown to be expressed in numerous cell types including lymphocytes, osteoclasts, neurons, and myotubes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Chin1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Asagiri1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-NegishiKoga1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Kulkarni1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-HernandezOchoa1">[27]</xref>. The first <italic>in vivo</italic> assessment of the role of the gene came however from the inactivation of the gene in mice. Two independent reports showed that <italic>Nfatc</italic>1&#x2212;/&#x2212; mice die at mid-gestation stage (e14.5) due to lack of EC growth and remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-delaPompa1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Ranger1">[9]</xref>. While Ranger AM et al showed a selective defect in the semilunar valves, the <italic>Nfatc1</italic>&#x2212;/&#x2212; embryos generated by de la Pompa Jl et al had severe defects in both atrioventricular and semilunar valves. Although this discrepancy might be linked to the genetic background and/or knock-out strategy, the fact that in both phenotypes the endocardial cushions are hypoplastic do point out to a major role for NFATC1 in endocardial cushion formation and proliferation. This role is even highlighted by the inactivation of PPP3CB, which encodes the calcineurin regulatory subunit, specifically in the endocardium and that results in a mirror-image phenotype identical to that of the <italic>Nfatc1</italic>&#x2212;/&#x2212; knock-out <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Chang1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Schulz1">[29]</xref>. This intrinsic requirement for endocardial expression of NFATC1 in endocardial cushion formation is dispensable for endocardial-mesenchymal transformation since in both <italic>Ppp3cb</italic>&#x2212;/&#x2212; and <italic>Nfatc1</italic>&#x2212;/&#x2212; embryos, mesenchymal cells are found in the cardiac jelly. The Calcineurin/NFAT pathway is however required in myocardial cells to control EMT through the repression of secreted VEGF.</p>
      <p>Given the fact that NFATC1 is at the center of valve formation in mammals, we hypothesize that mutations in the gene encoding it would be associated with valve malformations in humans. We have previously shown that a tandem repeat in the intronic region of <italic>NFATC1</italic> is associated with ventricular septal defects but with no valvular phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Yehya1">[30]</xref>. We therefore screened for such mutations in patients with different valve diseases registered at the congenital heart disease genetics program at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> showed 2 novel missense (P66L, I701L) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in only one patient with tricuspid atresia. Functional analyses of the mutated protein do show a defect in its cellular localization, transcriptional activities and DNA binding patterns suggesting that the mutations are disease causing.</p>

        <title>Generation of NFATC1 mutants by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis</title>
        <p>After identifying each mutant gene sequence, an oligonucleotide (forward primer) harboring the desired mutation was synthesized in a way to complement the human NFATC1 cDNA (Addgene) subcloned in the pCEP4 expression vector (Invitrogen). The second primer (reverse) was designed in a way that it starts from the same start site of the first primer but extends to the opposite direction. Primers were then phosphorylated and PCR was performed using Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit from FINNZYMES (product code: F-541). The resultant amplicon was ligated and transformed into XL-1 Blue competent bacteria. The generated plasmid was extracted and sequenced to make sure the mutation was incorporated. The primers used for generating the mutants are as follows: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x2032; CGGCGCACTCCACCCTGC<underline>T</underline>GGCCCCGTGC 3&#x2032;</named-content> an its reverse complement for the first mutation , and <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x2032; CAACGGTAACGCC<underline>C</underline>TCTTTCTAACCG 3&#x2032;</named-content> and its reverse complement for the second mutation.</p>

        <p>Hela cells were plated in 12-well Costar culture plates on cover slips with 100,000 cells/well. Tranfections were done on the second day of plating using polyethylenimine (PEI) transfecting reagent. Briefly, 2 &#xB5;g of DNA per well were diluted in 150 &#xB5;L of NaCl (150 mM, culture grade) in an eppendorf tube, vortexed and then 6 &#xB5;L of PEI (ratio 1&#x2236;3 of DNA to PEI) were added on the mixture of DNA/NaCl, vortexed for 3 seconds and then incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. The prepared mixture was applied on the cells gently and the medium was replaced on the second day.</p>
        <p>Then, immunofluorescence was performed on transfected Hela cells. The cells were first washed for 3 times with PBS 1&#xD7; (phosphate buffered saline), and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes. Fixed cells were blocked with 3% BSA/PBT (bovine serum albumin/phosphate buffer saline Tween) for 1 hour. The primary antibodies Mouse anti-flag (Flag M2 from Sigma Aldrich) and rabbit anti-HA (Santa Cruz) were used for assessment of subcellular localization of PPP3CA, NFATC1 and its mutants. The primary antibodies were diluted in BSA/PBT and added to the cells with an overnight incubation at 4&#xB0;C. The cells were then washed in PBT 3 times, and the secondary antibody horse anti-mouse biotinylated or donkey anti-rabbit biotinylated (General Electric) were diluted 1&#x2236;500 in BSA/PBT. They were added to the cells for 1 hour at RT with shaking. After washing 3 times with PBT, cells were incubated with Streptavidin Texas red or anti-mouse/anti-rabbit FITC for 1 hour at RT. Staining for the Nuclei was done using the Hoechst dye. The cells were mounted on a rectangular slide containing an anti-fading agent (DABCO), and the slides were examined using an Olympus BH-2 microscope. The nuclear versus cytoplasmic staining was conducted on 3 independent experiments and by assessing a total of 10 fields/per experiment with a total of 125 cells for each mutant and wild type protein.</p>

        <title>Luciferase Assay</title>
        <p>HeLa cells were transfected with the 1.4 kbp human DEGS1 or CCND1 promoter coupled to luciferase, the NFATC1 cDNA encoding the different proteins (Wt, P66L, I701L, and P66L/I701L) and/or the constitutively activated PPP3CA and/or GATA5 (Generous gifts from Drs J. Molkentin and M. Nemer) and/or HAND2. Both the DEGS1 and CCND1 promoters were amplified using specific primers and subcloned into the PGL3 Luciferase vector (Invitrogen). The 1.4 Kbp DEGS1 promoter harbors a conserved NFATC1 binding site at &#x2212;914 bp (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x2032; TCTTTA<bold><underline>GGAAA</underline></bold>GTCATCTGGTCTGC 3&#x2032;</named-content>) in addition to multiple GATA <italic>cis</italic> elements. After 24 hours, cells were washed with PBS (1X) and then lysed with 1X lysis buffer and left on the shaker for 20 minutes at RT. Luciferin (Promega, Cat # E 1501) was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. The lysed cells were transferred to a 96 well plate (Costar) to which luciferin was added and the signal was read immediately using the Ascent Fluoroscan in the Molecular Biology Core Facility at AUB.</p>

        <title>Protein over-expression and Western Blots</title>
        <p>For over expression experiments, transfections were done using calcium phosphate. Briefly, HEK293T cells were first plated in 100 mm culture plates (Corning) with 70% confluency. On the second day, 20 &#xB5;g DNA was added to an eppendorf tube; water was added till 200 &#xB5;l total volume. 400 &#xB5;l of HBS (Hepes Buffer Sulfate) is added to a tube. Then the mixture of DNA and water is added to the tube. Bubbles are created to promote more DNA precipitation. The mixture is left for 20 minutes at room temperature. The mixture was then applied on cells and after 4 hours the media was replaced. Nuclear protein extracts from HEK293T cells were obtained as previously described. 30 &#xB5;L aliquots were stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C . For Western blots, equal amounts of nuclear cell extracts (10 &#xB5;g protein) were resuspended in 5X laemmli buffers. The samples were boiled for 3 minutes and run on a denaturing SDS-PAGE for 1.5 hours then transferred to a PVDF membrane (Amersham). The membrane was blocked for 45 minutes in 2% non-fat dry milk . After blocking, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody, Anti- Flag (against NFATC1) or/and anti-HA (against PPP3CA). The antibody was diluted 1&#x2236;1000 in 1% non-fat dry milk and the incubation was carried out overnight at 4&#xB0;C. The membrane was afterwards incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish-peroxidase, anti-mouse or anti-rabbit- HRP, diluted 1&#x2236;40000. Revelation was done using the Western Lightening Chemiluminescence Kit (Perkin Elmer, Cat # NEL 103). The protein bands were visualized by autoradiography.</p>

        <title>Heterozygous SNPs in exon 2 and 8 of NFATC1 in one patient with TA</title>
        <p>We screened all 8 coding exons of the <italic>NFATC1</italic> gene for the 135 patients. Only one patient (#120) suffering from Tricuspid Atresia was found to have two missense heterozygous SNPs in exons 2 and 8 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049532-g001">Figure 1 A,B</xref>). Additional silent SNPs were found in various exons in many patients (data not shown) including patient 120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049532-g001">Figure 1 C,D</xref>). The patient presented to the clinic at the American University of Beirut Medical Center at sixteen years of age with severe hypoxemia probably due to complications of his undiagnosed tricuspid atresia problem over the years. The echocardiography at that stage showed in addition to TA, a D-TGA (transposition of the great arteries), atrial septal defect (ASD), hypoplasia of the aortic arch, and severe pulmonary hypertension. The patient died shortly after hospital admission. Family members of the patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049532-g002">Figure 2</xref>) were screened to check for a Mendelian inheritance of the missense SNPs. Surprisingly the father who is &#x201C;healthy&#x201D; with no cardiac phenotype was also found to carry the same SNPs. All other family members including the mother and two siblings were genotypically normal. The T/C nucleotide SNP in exon 2 leads to a Leucine instead of a Proline at position 66 and the A/C nucleotide SNP in exon 8 generates a Leucine instead of Isoleucine at position 701 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049532-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The screening of 100 healthy control individuals didn't show the presence of these SNPs, suggesting they might be disease-causing. Both SNPs were however found in the dbSNP database with the following rsID: rs1481042045 and rs113736099 for the P66L and I701L respectively. The minor allele frequency (MAF) is considerably very low especially for rs1481042045, and <italic>in silico</italic> prediction, using Polyphen-2 shows that this particular SNP is potentially damaging for the protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0049532-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

            <title>Effects of the two missense SNPs on the structure of the NFATC1 protein.</title>
            <p>A- The missense SNPs lead to a P66L substitution at the N-terminal region of the protein near the calcineurin-docking site (Cln binding), and to a I701L substitution at the C-terminal region downstream of the Rel Homolgy Domain (RHD). The schematic represents isoform A, the most abundant NFATC1 protein with 717 amino acids, a transactivation domain (TAD) at the N-terminus, and a DNA binding domain at the C-terminus. (NLS&#x200A;=&#x200A;nuclear localization signal, NES&#x200A;=&#x200A;nuclear export signal, and SP&#x200A;=&#x200A;Serine-Proline). B- The NFATC1 secondary structures were predicted and visualized by the Discovery Studio program (Acclerys Inc.). The results demonstrate the formation of a new beta-sheet in the P66L mutant and a deletion of a beta-sheet in the I701L mutant as compared to the wild type protein.</p>

        <title>NFATC1 mutations hampered Calcineurin induced transcriptional activity</title>
        <p>In order to assess the impact of the mutations on the regulatory function of NFATC1 protein, transactivation assays using the cyclin D1 (CCND1), and the Degenerative Spermatocyte Homolog 1 (DEGS1) promoter fused to luciferase were performed. HeLa cells were transfected with 1 &#xB5;g of (DEGS1/luc)/well and increasing concentration of Wt NFATC1 and NFATC1 mutants with or without constitutively activated PPP3CA. The DEGS1 promoter harbors a consensus NFAT binding site at &#x2212;914 bp in addition to multiple GATA binding sites. The results showed that the Wt NFATC1 is a moderate activator of the DEGS1 promoter with a maximum fold increase of 1.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049532-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Upon co-transfection with PPP3CA, the activation of DEGS1 promoter increased to reach 6.2 without attaining a synergistic threshold.

      <p>Congenital heart diseases are still the leading cause of death in newborns in addition to being the most frequent congenital diseases in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Hoffman1">[6]</xref>.

These mechanisms include the collaborative interaction between transcription factors and their occupancy of conserved <italic>cis</italic> regulatory elements on different cardiac-specific promoters. The cloning and functional characterization of the genes encoding these transcription factors have successfully led to the formulation of hypotheses that mutations in these genes could cause heart malformations in humans. More importantly, the available data on genes such as <italic>GATA4</italic>, <italic>NKX2-5</italic> and <italic>TBX5</italic> do point to a dose-dependent genotype-phenotype correlation whereby haploinsufficiency is by itself diseases-causing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Nemer2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Schott1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-ReamonBuettner1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Pehlivan1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Mori1">[38]</xref>.

        <title>NFATC1 haploinsufficiency and Tricupid Atresia</title>
        <p>We have shown two heterozygous mutations on one allele of the NFATC1 gene in one patient with tricuspid atresia out of 19. The fact that the double mutation is also found in the father who has a normal phenotype argues for incomplete penetrance, a phenomenon seen in other genes encoding transcription factors involved in cardiac and non-cardiac congenital diseases. One such example is the Arg25Cys mutation, which was shown to abrogate the transcriptional activity of the NKX2-5 protein and yet has reduced penetrance depending on the population study groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Elliott1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Akcaboy1">[40]</xref>. In mice, the Holt-Oram syndrome recreated with the heterozygous Tbx5 model is the best example of a dosage dependent phenotype-genotype correlation. In fact, null mice for both Tbx5 alleles showed a very severe cardiac phenotype leading to early embryonic lethality, while mice carrying only one Tbx5 allele display a spectrum of phenotypes recapitulating the ones observed in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Bruneau1">[41]</xref>. Unfortunately, in our case the indexed-patient was evaluated for the first time at the age of 16 years at our center when he presented with severe cyanosis and complications of his condition which was not well taken care of at earlier stages and had led to the his death few days after his admission to the hospital. Exon by exon sequencing of different genes encoding transcription factors, including <italic>GATA4</italic>,<italic>5</italic>,<italic>6</italic>, <italic>TBX5</italic>,<italic>20</italic>, <italic>NKX2-5</italic>, <italic>PITX2</italic>, and <italic>NFATC1</italic> was carried out on the whole family and none except <italic>NFATC1</italic> showed polymorphisms that could be disease causing. We cannot exclude however, that other not tested gene(s) could also be mutated and carried on the maternally inherited allele, and that the combination of such mutations is responsible for the observed phenotype. Alternatively, we could postulate that the father who is phenotypically normal carries the two mutations on separate alleles and that during spermatogenesis a cross-over did occur leaving the two mutations on one allele inherited by the patient, and another normal inherited by the other children. Structurally, the two mutations leading to amino acids substitution at both the N and C terminal of the protein were predicted to be pathogenic, and in our <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis we did show that the double mutation affects both the transcriptional activity and the localization of the protein. At the subcellular localization level, most of the NFATC1 double mutant proteins failed to translocate to the nucleus when co-expressed with constitutively active calcineurin. Although the mutation is not within the calcineurin docking site, we do suggest that the distorted structure of the protein doesn't allow proper dephosphorylation of its N-terminal domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Masuda1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Rodriguez1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-MartinezMartinez1">[43]</xref>. This is supported by the results obtained in gel shift experiments whereby the DNA binding activity was significantly reduced by 30&#x2013;40% although the same amount of overepressed proteins was used for both wild type and mutant NFATC1. On the other hand, the structure function analysis done on the most expressed isoform, Isoform A, does also mask a possible effect the mutation I701L could have on the sumolation process on isoform C which occurs on K702 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Nayak1">[44]</xref>.</p>

        <title>The NFATC1 P66L/I701L double mutant: an orphan partner?</title>
        <p>NFATC1 is a weak transcription factor although it has a specific and strong DNA affinity. Its activity is however enhanced by its interaction with ubiquitously and/or tissue-specific transcription factors like members of the AP-1 and GATA families <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Wisniewska1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Musaro1">[45]</xref>. GATA5 was previously shown to be a strong partner of NFATC1 and its recent inactivation in mice did show that the embryos develop aortic stenosis one of the most frequent valve abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Nemer1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Laforest1">[46]</xref>. The observed phenotype in mice involves the formation of a bicuspid aortic valve instead of a tricuspid one suggesting a role of GATA5 similar to that of NFATC1 in the proliferation of valve precursors and final remodeling part. Our results go in parallel with this suggested role, since the interaction of GATA5 and NFATC1 is relatively hampered by the double mutation. In fact, the functional synergy between both proteins was reduced by 50% over the DEGS1 promoter, which was recently shown by our group to be directly regulated by NFAT and HAND2 in chronic hypoxia, a mouse model mimicking cyanotic CHD including Tricuspid Atresia (unpublished data). The HAND2/NFATC1 interaction is also severely affected by the double mutation suggesting a combinatorial interaction between GATA5/NFATC1/HAND2 in a common pathway regulating endocardial cushion formation and valve maturation. One could argue however, that the fact the double mutant is trapped in the cytoplasm might cause the observed inhibition. Nevertheless even with higher doses of transfected mutant vectors, the observed synergy with the wild type protein couldn't be recapitulated. Our hypothetical model would involve regulation of downstream target genes like cyclin D1, which was previously shown to be a direct target for GATA and NFATC1 proteins in the early phases of endocardial cushion proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049532-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In fact, in human pulmonary valve endothelial cells, NFATC1 activates in vitro endothelial-specific genes ultimately leading to their proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Johnson1">[47]</xref>. Furthermore, NFATC1 promotes cell cycle progression in 3T3-L1 cells showing altered expression of cell cycle genes including high levels of cyclin D1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0049532-Neal1">[48]</xref>. On the other hand, DEGS1 would be ideal factor involved in valve maturation whereby apoptosis is a key event. In fact, DEGS1 is known to be involved in <italic>de novo</italic> ceramide production, an obligate path leading to apoptosis.</p>
