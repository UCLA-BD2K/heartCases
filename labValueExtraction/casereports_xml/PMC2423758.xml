		<p>Since 1984, we have performed extended radical resection combined with extended intraoperative
radiation therapy (IORT) for pancreatic cancer. This approach has provided
a dramatic improvement in long-term survival and control of local recurrence. Hepatic metastases,
however, remain an unsolved problem. Among patients with this combined therapy, we
found hepatic metastases in 8 of 22 patients postoperatively. Four of these 8 were considered
candidates for further therapy and underwent treatment for their hepatic metastases, the other
4 had too extensive disease. Two patients with multiple hepatic metastases underwent percutaneous
ethanol injection therapy and chemotherapy, but they died within a year. Two
patients with a solitary hepatic metastases underwent hepatic resection. One patient died two
years and six months after the first operation because of multiple metastases in the liver and both
lungs, while the other patient is still alive over six years after the first operation with an excellent
performance status. When a patient has no local recurrence and a solitary metastasis in the liver,
surgical resection of the liver metastasis should be performed.</p>
