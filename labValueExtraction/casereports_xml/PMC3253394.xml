      <abstract>
        <p>We report on three cases of longstanding pulmonary tuberculosis patients with coronary to bronchial artery fistula (CBF) who presented with recurrent massive hemoptysis. The first and second patients died because of decreased functional pulmonary volume plus massive hemoptysis and cannulation failure of CBF due to hypovolemic vasospasm, respectively. When recurrent hemoptysis occurs despite successful embolization treatment, CBF should be considered as a potential bleeding source. Moreover, a coronary angiography should be performed, especially in patients with longstanding cardiopulmonary disease such as pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Coronary to bronchial artery fistula (CBF) or anastomosis is congenital, and is considered an unusual finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Most cases of CBF are asymptomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). However, the coronary steal phenomenon can cause dyspnea and chest pain, and is currently treated with endovascular embolization or surgical ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Many reports of CBF focus on the effect of endovascular embolization with respect to the coronary steal phenomena or the possibility of embolic material regurgitation from the bronchial artery to the coronary artery during endovascular treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p>
      <p>Concurrent embolization of the bronchial artery and aberrant systemic arteries is an effective treatment for massive hemoptysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). For recurrent hemoptysis in patients with CBF, embolization of the bronchial artery via the CBF may be considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). However, in most cases of recurrent massive hemoptysis treated with endovascular embolization, detection of CBF before the interventional procedure is very difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p>
      <p>We report three patients with recurrent massive hemoptysis and decreased cardiopulmonary reserve due to old pulmonary tuberculosis, two of whom died despite embolization treatment.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORTS</title>
      <sec>
        <title>Case 1</title>
        <p>A 70-year-old male was treated with conservative management for a minor case of hemoptysis. However, massive hemoptysis (about 500 mL/24 hours) and hypoxemia occurred and the patient deteriorated. The patient had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis about 30 years prior, had suffered from congestive heart failure with arrhythmia for ten years, and had been treated for upper thoracic tuberculous spondylitis with posterior spinal fusion for the last 15 days.</p>
        <p>A chest radiograph revealed severe destructive changes of both upper lobes, secondary emphysematous changes of both lower lobes and recent development of bilateral consolidations due to aspirated blood.</p>
        <p>Embolization treatment was performed with a 5-Fr catheter and a coaxial 2.5-Fr microcatheter (Renegade; Boston Scientific, Watertown, MA) for both bronchial and other possible systemic arteries with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles, 350-500 &#xB5;m in diameter (Contour; Boston Scientific, Watertown, MA) and microcoils (Tornado embolization microcoil: Cook, Bloomington, IN). Two days later, the patient suffered massive hemoptysis. No evidence of recanalization of previously embolized arteries on angiography was found and additional embolization of both upper lobar pulmonary arteries was performed, because radiologically undetectable pulmonary artery bleeding was suspected. However, the patient continued to suffer from hemoptysis.</p>
        <p>On the third trial of angiography, five hours after the second embolization, coronary angiography showed a CBF (proximal left circumflex arterial branch) from the left circumflex coronary artery to the left bronchial artery combined with a severe pulmonary artery shunt at the left upper lung. The CBF was embolized after superselection across the CBF to prevent embolization of the coronary artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Hemoptysis was stopped immediately after the third embolization but the patient died 12 hours later due to further deterioration of hypoxemia despite intensive ventilator care.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Case 2</title>
        <p>A 57-year-old male arrived at the emergency room due to cardiac arrest. He had a history of diabetes and pneumonia six and two years prior, respectively, and underwent embolization treatment for hemoptysis five days prior and was discharged one day earlier. He was diagnosed with pulmonary and endobronchial tuberculosis and was prescribed medications for tuberculosis.</p>
        <p>About one hour before arriving at the emergency room, about 700 mL of hemoptysis occurred. For the first angiography performed five days prior, the right interocostobronchial artery to the left lower lung, aberrant bronchial arteries from the left internal mammary artery supplying the left upper lung, and several left posterior intercostal arteries supplying the left lower lung were successfully embolized with PVA particles.</p>
        <p>Computed tomography (CT) showed no enlarged bronchial arteries, and angiography of the descending thoracic aorta and left subclavian artery showed no systemic hypervascularization in either lung. Both coronary angiographies showed a CBF (sinoatrial nodal artery) from the right coronary artery coursing along the left main bronchus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). However, cannulation and embolization of CBF failed due to spastic changes of CBF and tachycardia. Bleeding through the endotracheal tube and hypoxemia persisted despite intensive care resulting in death two days after embolization.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Case 3</title>
        <p>A 68-year-old female experienced four episodes of hemoptysis (more than 400 mL/48 hours). She had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis that was diagnosed about 50 years prior and had underwent embolization of both bronchial arteries and multiple systemic collaterals due to recurrent hemoptysis (seven times) over the five years prior to presentation. Serial chest radiographs and CT showed severe destructive changes with bronchiectasis and cavitary lesions at the left lung.</p>
        <p>Because bronchial or systemic arteries causing hemoptysis were not found, right and left coronary angiographies were performed. The coronary angiography revealed two CBFs from both coronary arteries (sinoatrial nodal artery from right coronary artery and distal left circumflex arterial branch) to the left upper and lower lung as well as a massive pulmonary artery shunt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). After careful selection of CBFs as far from the coronary arterial branches as possible with a microcatheter, an embolization was performed with PVA particles and small amounts of Gelfoam particles, resulting in no visible residual hypervascularization or pulmonary artery shunt. The patient was asymptomatic without hemoptysis, but abnormal electrocardiography (EKG) (unusual P axis and short PR, probably junctional tachycardia) and increased cardiac enzyme (serum creatine kinase 375 IU/L, normal range 22-269; creatine kinase-MB 33.0 ng/mL, normal range 0.0-3.4; troponin-I 11.04 ng/mL, normal range 0.0-0.3) were noted the next day. Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular systolic function and EKG was normalized on the sixth day post-embolization. The patient was discharged without any symptoms.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Coronary to bronchial artery fistula is present at birth and remains closed and asymptomatic in most of the population. However, this anastomosis may become enlarged and functional in various cardiovascular and chronic pulmonary diseases with an incidence of about 0.6%. Localized bronchiectasis is the most common condition associated with CBF; however, our three cases the CBFs were combined with pulmonary tuberculosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although chest pain is the most frequent symptom of CBF, massive hemoptysis can also occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The detection of CBF as a cause of hemoptysis is challenging, because CBF is a rare cause of hemoptysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In addition, CBF is seldom detected prior to embolization treatment for hemoptysis if coronary angiography is not performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). For detection of coronary and pulmonary artery abnormalities in patients with hemoptysis, special coronary or pulmonary CT angiography protocol is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p>
      <p>There are reports of successful embolization of bronchial arteries originating from a coronary artery for control of hemoptysis; however, unlike our cases, the presence of CBF was fortunately suspected on CT coronary angiography prior to the embolization procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p>
      <p>Delayed diagnosis and treatment of arteries involved in systemic hypervascularization of the lung, including bronchial arteries, might lead to catastrophic consequences in patients with hemoptysis. Furthermore, massive hemoptysis may be more likely to be fatal in patients with reduced cardiopulmonary reserve, as in our cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Our patients had decreased functional pulmonary parenchymal volume due to pulmonary tuberculosis, and therefore any insult could have been fatal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although symptomatic CBF is extremely rare, suspicion of the presence and detection of CBF is crucial to avoid serious complications during interventional procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Further, proper knowledge of CBF may help clinicians to treat patients with hemoptysis and prevent procedure-related complications.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, when recurrent hemoptysis occurs despite successful embolization of possible systemic arteries, a coronary angiography should be performed, especially in patients with reduced cardiopulmonary reserve and longstanding cardiopulmonary disease.</p>
