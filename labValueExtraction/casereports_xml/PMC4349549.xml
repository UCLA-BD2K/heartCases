      <abstract>
        <p>A 7-year-old, miniature
dachshund was referred for examination and treatment of persistent anorexia, deep
yellow-coloured urine and leucocytosis. The clinical sign of jaundice, results from a
serum biochemistry profile and ultrasonographic images suggested a biliary tract
obstruction. A cholecystectomy was performed to remove the obstruction. Histopathological
assessment of the resected gallbladder and partial common bile duct indicated diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma. Twelve days after the initial operation, a second procedure was
performed due to bile leakage into the abdominal cavity. Chemotherapy was administered
twice after the second operation but discontinued, because the dog showed adverse effects.
The dog is still alive 24 months after the surgery. To the authors&#x2019; knowledge, this is the
first description of canine gallbladder lymphoma.</p>

    <p>Malignant lymphomas arise in lymphoid tissues, such as lymph nodes and spleen. Most
extranodal lymphomas originate from the gastrointestinal tract [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Among them, gallbladder lymphoma is extremely rare. In human medicine,
only 66 cases of lymphoma of the gallbladder have been reported in the literature [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Most reported cases of gallbladder lymphoma in humans
have been of the diffuse large B-cell (DLBCL) or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)
lymphoma types [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. There have been no reports of canine
gallbladder lymphoma, even though lymphoma is the most common hematopoietic tumor affecting
dogs [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To the authors&#x2019; knowledge, this is the first
report which details the characteristics of a canine gallbladder lymphoma.</p>
    <p>A 7-year-old, spayed, female miniature dachshund, weighing 4.2 kg, was referred to the Animal
Medical Center at Gifu University for examination and treatment for persistent anorexia of 16
days&#x2019; duration, discoloured urine of a deep yellow color and leucocytosis which did not
respond to antibiotics. Prior to referral, the dog had received pharmacological treatment
(cefazolin, enrofloxacin, glutathione, ursodeoxycholic acid and trepibutone) for 2 weeks at
the practitioner. Following this treatment, the anorexia improved slightly, but the urine
became a darker yellow color, and the leucocytosis remained unchanged. Prior to the initial
presentation at our hospital, the dog did not have any past medical problems.</p>
    <p>At the first visit to the Animal Medical Center at Gifu University, the dog was lethargic,
and her conjunctiva and oral mucosa were markedly icteric. A complete blood cell count (CBC)
showed apparent leucocytosis (31,500 cells/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>; reference range [RR], 6,000&#x2013;17,000 cells/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>)
with a mature neutrophilia (28,700 cells/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>; RR, 3,000&#x2013;11,500
cells/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>). Serum biochemical analysis revealed an increased total bilirubin
concentration (4.4 mg/d<italic>l</italic>; RR, 0.1&#x2013;0.5 mg/d<italic>l</italic>) and markedly
elevated activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT; 1,846 U/<italic>l</italic>; RR, 17&#x2013;78
U/<italic>l</italic>), aspartate aminotransferase (AST; 323 U/<italic>l</italic>; RR, 17&#x2013;44
U/<italic>l</italic>), &#x3B3;-glutamyltransferase (GGT; 86 U/<italic>l</italic>; RR, 5&#x2013;14
U/<italic>l</italic>) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP; 10,500 U/<italic>l</italic>; RR, 47&#x2013;254
U/<italic>l</italic>). Abdominal ultrasonographic evaluation confirmed the hyperechoic
sludgy content and the hyperechoic gallbladder wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.
1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Abdominal ultrasonography of the gallbladder. Abdominal ultrasonography of the
gallbladder showing a hyperechoic wall (arrow) and hyperechoic sludgy content

    <p>The jaundice, serum biochemical results and ultrasonographic images suggested a biliary tract
obstruction. An emergency cholecystectomy was performed, because of the rapid deterioration in
the patient&#x2019;s general condition. The abdomen was surgically exposed with a ventral midline
incision under general anesthesia. The gallbladder was prominently enlarged in the
mid-abdominal cavity. The liver lobes appeared yellow in color and were mildly distended
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Intraoperative abdominal cavity findings (A) and Mucous membrane in the gallbladder
(B).</p><p>The enlarged gallbladder and the yellow and mildly distended liver lobes are apparent
(A). Mildly yellowed gallbladder wall lumina and several gallstones are observed in the
gallbladder during surgery (B).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-117-g002"/></fig>). Incision of the gallbladder wall revealed light green-colored muddy bile and mildly
yellowed lumina of the gallbladder wall. Several gallstones were observed in the gallbladder
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2B</xref>). To confirm CBD patency, an 8Fr
multipurpose tube (Atom Multipurpose Tube; Atom Medical Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was
inserted into the CBD from the resected end of the gallbladder. However, the tube became stuck
in the middle of the CBD, because of an approximately 1-cm compression outside the CBD caused
by proliferative tissue. The CBD was also partially dissected and subsequently sutured. To
prevent postoperative stenosis, an indwelling feeding tube was placed in the CBD. The
cholecystectomy was completed by removing the remaining gallbladder wall. A guillotine suture
biopsy was performed on the quadrate lobe of the liver. A closed and continuous low-vacuum
surgical drainage system (J-VAC<sup>&#xAE;</sup>; Johnson &amp; Johnson, NJ, U.S.A.) was placed at
the gallbladder site, and peritoneal lavage using saline solution was performed. After the
surgery, the enzyme activity levels of AST and ALT and the total bilirubin concentration
gradually decreased. Initially, the postsurgical drainage fluid was deep yellow; however, ten
days after surgery, the drainage fluid suddenly became dark green and remained unchanged for 2
days. Since the appearance of the drainage fluid suggested leakage of bile into the abdominal
cavity, a second surgery was performed on day 12 after the first surgery. The abdomen was
surgically exposed with a ventral midline incision under general anesthesia. The suture site
of the CBD was widely obstructed and disconnected, and bile was leaking from a small opening
in the CBD near the hepatic portal side. The original CBD was disconnected, because of a new
compression caused by the proliferative tissue that was similar to the compression observed at
the first surgery. A feeding tube (French size 8) was placed to bypass the obstructed part of
the CBD to establish normal bile flow between the cranial part of the CBD and the duodenum. An
indwelling closed and continuous low-vacuum surgical drainage system was placed after the
surgery.</p>
    <p>The dissected gallbladder, proliferating tissue from the CBD, and liver biopsy collected
during the first surgery were histopathologically examined. Tissue from the gallbladder and
the CBD comprised diffuse large lymphoid neoplastic cells with large vesicular nuclei which
had coarse chromatin and one or several prominent nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Overview (A) and detail (B) of the histopathological aspects of the gallbladder.</p><p>The gallbladder and proliferating tissue of the common bile duct comprise diffuse large

several prominent nucleoli. Several mitotic figures are observed throughout the

predominant in the perivascular area, because severe necrosis obscured the remaining tissues.
In a marginal area assumed to be the gallbladder wall, moderate to severe fibrosis was
observed, and the mucosal epithelial cells were absent. Immunohistochemical evaluation of the
neoplastic lymphoid cells showed they stained with anti-CD20 and anti-Pax5 antibodies, but did
not stain with anti-CD3 antibodies; only infiltrative small mature lymphocytes were positive
for CD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_004" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Immunohistochemical staining of the dissected gallbladder.</p><p>(A) Neoplastic lymphoid cells are positive for CD20 in the cytoplasmic membrane.

<italic>&#xB5;</italic>m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-117-g004"/></fig>). Based on the histopathological and immunohistochemical results, the present neoplasm
was diagnosed as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In hepatic tissue, moderate to severe
neutrophilic infiltration, hepatocyte vacuolation consistent with the accumulation of lipid
and fibrosis with moderate proliferation of cholangiole cells in Glisson&#x2019;s capsules were
observed. Hepatic infiltration with neoplastic cells was not observed.</p>
    <p>Before the second surgery, computed tomography (CT) was performed to detect lymphoma cell
infiltration in additional tissues. There was no apparent lymph node enlargement or neoplastic
lesions in the thoracic or abdominal cavity.</p>
    <p>The dog was hospitalized for 5 days after the second surgery. After discharge, the patient
received daily total parenteral nutrition, antibiotics and drainage fluid clearing. The
drainage tube was removed 18 days after the second surgery. Routine clinical, hematological
and biochemistry examinations were periodically performed. The dog&#x2019;s condition improved, and
her appetite stabilized approximately 1 month after the second surgery. Only antibiotic
therapy was continued for an additional month. Chemotherapy for lymphoma included low-dose
chlorambucil (Leukeran<sup>&#xAE;</sup>; GlaxoSmithKline LLC, Philadelphia, PA, U.S.A., 2
mg/m<sup>2</sup>) administered orally once a day beginning at 3 months after the second
surgery. However, chemotherapy was discontinued due to an elevation in the patient&#x2019;s liver
enzyme activities and nausea. Because the liver enzyme activities decreased after one month,
chemotherapy was restarted at the same dose, but the schedule was changed to twice a day.
However, chemotherapy was stopped after the liver enzyme activities increased and the nausea
reappeared. Since then, the dog has not received any chemotherapy, but has been placed on a
commercial therapeutic diet for gastrointestinal care (i/d<sup>&#xAE;</sup> Canine Gastrointestinal
Health; Hill&#x2019;s Pet Nutrition, Topeka, KS, U.S.A.) and nutritional supplements (vegetable
support; W/I System Co., Tokyo, Japan). Routine follow-up examinations, including
hematological and biochemical examinations, are performed monthly. The dog no longer appears
icteric, and most laboratory values are within the reference range, except for GGT (372
U/<italic>l</italic>) and ALP (1,064 U/<italic>l</italic>). The dog&#x2019;s weight increased
slightly from 4.2 to 4.5 kg. The dog&#x2019;s overall condition at 24 months from the first visit is
good.</p>
    <p>In veterinary medicine, only two cases of feline gallbladder lymphoma have been reported to
date [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. One
cat was diagnosed with lymphoma based on cytologic evaluation of fine-needle aspirates of the
gallbladder, and a urine sediment evaluation identified concurrent B-cell lymphoma in the
urinary bladder [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, the immunophenotype of
the lymphoma in the gallbladder in the cat was speculated to be of B-cell lineage; however,
because immunohistochemistry was not performed for the cells from the gallbladder, it remains
unclear whether this cat had two independent tumors or whether the same clonal expansion of
lymphoma cells occurred in both the urinary bladder and the gallbladder. Histopathological
examination with immunohistochemistry in another cat was consistent with a diagnosis of
small-cell lymphoma of T cells within the gallbladder, liver and small intestine. In humans,
the majority of immunophenotypes were of B-cell lineage and included extranodal marginal zone
lymphoma (24%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (24%) and follicular lymphoma (15%) [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the dog from our report, the lymphoma was
demonstrated to be of B-cell origin, similar to the former case described in a cat and to
humans. In general, lymphoma of B-cell origin shows a positive response to chemotherapy,
compared with those of T-cell origin [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the current
case, we chose low dose chlorambucil chemotherapy that is considered a safe and effective
treatment for dogs [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], because the dog&#x2019;s general
condition was poor. However, chemotherapy was not continued, because the patient experienced
adverse side effects associated with the treatment. Therefore, we were unable to assess the
response to the chemotherapy for gallbladder lymphoma in this dog; however, the gallbladder
lymphoma in the present case was not clinically malignant. Without potent and long-term
chemotherapy, the dog has maintained her quality of life 24 months from the first visit.</p>
    <p>The most common clinical symptom in human patients with gallbladder lymphoma is upper
abdominal pain [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. One of 2
cats with gallbladder lymphoma also showed a pain response with palpation of the cranial
abdomen [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the dog of this report, we could not
elicit upper abdominal pain, suggesting it may be difficult to identify upper abdominal pain
in animals with gallbladder lymphoma. Most human patients had cholecystectomies, and the
diagnosis of gallbladder lymphoma was histologically confirmed [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Canine
gallbladder lymphoma is extremely rare and difficult to diagnose on the basis of symptoms,
ultrasonography or hematology and biochemical results, but based on the findings in human
medicine, gallbladder lymphoma should be a differential diagnosis for biliary tract
obstruction in dogs.</p>
    <p>There were several surgically related findings in the present case. Substituting a feeding
tube temporarily for the CBD was extremely challenging, but worked well. Using a closed-type
vacuum drain may be valuable for patients with gallbladder rupture or biliary tract damage,
because its use prevents peritonitis spread by the continuous suction of leaked bile,
inflammatory mediators and exudates. Thus, the surgical site around the CBD may heal faster
without systemic inflammation.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, gallbladder lymphoma is exceedingly rare, but should be a differential
diagnosis for a biliary tract obstruction in dogs, and postoperative histopathological
evaluation is essential for accurate diagnosis. This is the first report of canine gallbladder
lymphoma.</p>
