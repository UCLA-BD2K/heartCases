        <p>Atelectasis is a pulmonary disorder that lengthens the hospitalization time of
newborns in intensive care units, resulting in increased morbidity among these
infants. High-flow nasal cannulae have been used in newborns to prevent atelectasis
and/or expand pulmonary regions affected by atelectasis; however, to date, no
evidence-based data regarding this approach have been reported. In this paper, we
report on the cases of two male newborn patients. The first and second patients
described in this report were hospitalized for a neurosurgical procedure and the
treatment of abdominal disease, respectively, and were subjected to invasive
mechanical ventilation for 4 and 36 days, respectively. After extubation, these
patients continued receiving oxygen therapy but experienced clinical and radiological
worsening typical of atelectasis. In both cases, by 24 hours after the implantation
of an high-flow nasal cannulae to provide noninvasive support, radiological
examinations revealed the complete resolution of atelectasis. In these cases, the use
of an high-flow nasal cannulae was effective in reversing atelectasis. Thus, this
approach may be utilized as a supplemental noninvasive ventilatory therapy to avoid
unnecessary intubation.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Atelectasis is a pulmonary disorder that often occurs after extubation, particularly
during patients' postoperative periods. In these patients, underlying diseases can be
associated with other conditions, resulting in respiratory complications that include
bloating, antalgic positioning, shallow breathing, and a need for optimized analgesia.
Atelectasis is associated with increased hospitalization time for newborns (NBs)
admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs); the resulting prolonged
hospitalization duration can lead to increased morbidity among these NBs.<sup>(<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>Respiratory therapy is one resource used to resolve atelectasis. This treatment involves
not only the use of specific techniques for the removal of bronchial secretions but also
the application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in the airways to prevent
collapses or expand collapsed regions, thereby improving gas exchange and reducing
respiratory effort.<sup>(<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>In addition to the aforementioned techniques, the use of a high-flow nasal cannula
(HFNC) can prevent the complete occlusion of the nostrils and maintain the perfusion of
the nasal mucosa. These effects may be achieved because an HFNC has a smaller internal
diameter than a standard nasal catheter. Gases provided using HFNCs (at a flow rate of 2
to 8 L/min for neonates) are heated and humidified to reduce bleeding and pulmonary
hemorrhage by preventing the heat loss and drying of the mucosa.<sup>(<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>Therefore, HFNCs can be used to treat the same diseases for which continuous positive
airway pressure (CPAP) is indicated, such as apnea of prematurity, and to transition
from invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) to noninvasive mechanical
ventilation.<sup>(<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>The objective of this study was to report on the use of an HFNC as an alternative
approach for the resolution of post-extubation atelectasis.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>The two evaluated NBs were extubated according to a ventilator weaning protocol and
placed on oxygen therapy (via nebulization) with sustained physical therapy. After the
failure of conventional ventilatory support, a noninvasive ventilatory support (Fisher
and Paykel Healthcare, Irvine, California, USA) was chosen. This nasal cannula is
specifically designed for neonates and features less unheated space than other cannulae,
breathing circuits with spiral wire technology, and an MR850 humidifier that ensures an
ideal gas temperature.</p>
      <p>In the present study, the oxygen blender from a Newport Medical E100 ventilator
(Plainfield, Indiana, USA) was coupled to oxygen and a compressed air system. As
illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">figure 1</xref>, this configuration
allowed for the intake of the desired fraction of inhaled oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>).
After mixing, the gas circulated through the flow meter of the ventilator. Based on the
gestational age and weight of each NB, gas flow was adjusted to 7L/min in accordance
with the manufacturer's instructions.</p>

        <title>Case 1</title>
        <p>We examined a late-preterm male NB with a gestational age of 35 weeks. At birth, this
NB weighed 2,810g, which was adequate given his gestational age. He was admitted to
the NICU at the age of 3 days. The patient presented with septic shock and required
invasive ventilatory and hemodynamic support as well as the administration of
broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient, who presented with myelomeningocele as the
underlying disease, remained intubated for 4 days to treat infection and preserve
airways. Ventilator weaning was performed quickly because no pulmonary changes were
observed. Pre-extubation blood gas analysis results indicated a pH of 7.39, a partial
pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO<sub>2</sub>) of 25.8, a partial pressure of oxygen
(pO<sub>2</sub>) of 190, a bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-)</sup> concentration
of 18mEq/L, a base excess (BE) of -1.5, and an oxygen saturation (SatO<sub>2</sub>)
of 99%. The patient was extubated, and treatment with nebulized oxygen was
immediately provided. After 6 hours, the patient developed tachydyspnea and exhibited
decreased pulse oxygen saturation, with a vesicular murmur in the right hemithorax. A
plain chest radiograph revealed that the upper two-thirds of the right lung was
opaque (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

        <title>Case 2</title>
        <p>We evaluated a full-term male NB with a gestational age of 37 weeks. At birth, this
patient weighed 3,380g, which was appropriate for his gestational age. The patient's
mother was hypertensive, and the patient not only had been diagnosed with meconium
peritonitis and intrauterine intestinal perforation but also exhibited ascites and
anasarca. The patient underwent various surgical procedures that compromised his
respiratory mechanics and hampered early weaning from IMV. After the patient was
clinically stabilized, his arterial blood analysis results (pH=7.41,
pCO<sub>2</sub>=45.8, pO<sub>2</sub>=67.9, HCO<sub>3</sub>=27mEq/L, BE=-2, and
SatO<sub>2</sub>=92%) indicated that he was eligible for extubation. After 36 days
of orotracheal intubation, extubation was performed, and treatment with nebulized
oxygen was provided. At 6 hours after extubation, a plain chest radiograph produced
images consistent with atelectasis throughout the right hemithorax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3A</xref>). An HFNC system with a gas flow of
7L/min and an FiO<sub>2</sub> of 30% was implanted in the patient. A chest radiograph
obtained after 24 hours of HFNC treatment revealed no atelectasis; therefore, the use
of the HFNC system was suspended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>In this paper, we report on the successful use of high-flow nasal cannulae for the
treatment of extensive post-extubation atelectasis in two infants who underwent surgical
treatment.</p>
      <p>Post-extubation atelectasis typically occurs within the first 24 hours after extubation
in 10-30% of patients who have been subjected to IMV. In these cases, atelectasis is
generally treated by reintubation or by providing noninvasive ventilatory support.</p>
      <p>When providing non-invasive ventilation to neonates, we rely on the use of CPAP, which
can be implemented via nasal prongs. However, this intervention can cause nasal septal
injury and discomfort to the patient.<sup>(<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>The use of an HFNC is another approach that can be adopted for applying positive
pressure. However, this approach is not yet routinely used in NICUs despite prior
reports indicating positive HFNC-related results.<sup>(<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)</sup> Among neonates, HFNCs were first used in preterm infants (PTIs)
in 2001 for the treatment of apnea of prematurity; since that time, HFNC systems have
become an alternative to traditional non-invasive respiratory support.<sup>(<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>According to Dysart et al.,<sup>(<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup> the
generation of PEEP through HFNC-based support rather than traditional approaches
produces improved pulmonary mechanics, reduced dead space, decreased inspiratory
resistance, and consequent improvement in patient oxygenation.</p>
      <p>It is challenging to compare HFNC systems with nasal CPAP because of difficulties in
measuring the pressures generated by various approaches and the existence of divergent
data in studies that have measured gas pressure at different locations. However, the
conclusions of these studies are similar. In particular, these investigations have
indicated that both approaches are effective and that the pressure generated by
different treatments can be influenced by several factors, including the ratio of
catheter size to nostril size and the need to ensure that the patient's mouth remains
closed. However, certain studies have reported better tolerance for an HFNC than for
CPAP.<sup>(<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>In a prospective randomized study, Miller and Dowd<sup>(<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup> compared two types of HFNC systems with respect to the success of
tracheal extubation. In this comparison, 39 PTIs were classified into 2 groups; the
Fisher and Paykel (FP) system was used for one group, and the Vapotherm 2000i (VP)
system was used for the other group. Prong size was chosen in accordance with inner
nostril diameter. A gas flow of 6L/min and an FiO<sub>2</sub> of &#x2264; 30% were utilized,
with weaning of the HFNC by 1L/min every 24 hours based either on peripheral oxygen
saturation and a PaCO<sub>2</sub> of &#x2264;45mmHg or on transcutaneous carbon dioxide
monitoring. However, when any level of respiratory distress was detected, weaning was
suspended, and gas flow was returned to initial values. Extubation failure was regarded
as the occurrence of respiratory distress in the first 72 hours after extubation. All of
the evaluated parameters were statistically similar for the two HFNC systems, with the
exception of the cost of support, which was lower for the FP system than for the VP
system.</p>
      <p>A review by Wilkinson et al.<sup>(<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</sup>
described 4 randomized studies involving PTIs (with gestational ages &lt;37 weeks).
Subsets of these infants received respiratory support after birth. In addition, these
patients were treated with a high gas flow (&gt;1L/min) of pure or mixed oxygen and were
subjected to various alternative interventions, including headbox oxygen, low-flow nasal
cannulae, nasal CPAP, and HFNCs. The authors of the review concluded that there was a
lack of scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of HFNC for respiratory support
in PTIs and that the number of reintubations was higher among PTIs treated with HFNCs
than among PTIs treated with CPAP.</p>
      <p>Although the extant literature includes controversial findings regarding HFNCs, the two
cases described in this study benefited from the use of HFNCs, which allowed for the
resolution of post-extubation atelectasis within the first 24 hours after the initiation
of treatment. Moreover, HFNCs are well tolerated by patients, particularly among
patients who are recovering from neurosurgery and/or abdominal surgery.</p>

      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>The use of an high-flow nasal cannulae was effective and tolerated well by newborn
patients, suggesting that this intervention can serve as a complement to physical
therapy management in the treatment of post-extubation atelectasis.</p>
