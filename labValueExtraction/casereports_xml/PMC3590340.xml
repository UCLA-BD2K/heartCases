      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Vascular smooth muscle tumors are rare and include a variety of neoplastic lesions characterized by their histological similarity to adult smooth muscle tissue. These tumors are usually benign as with diseases such as leiomyoma, intravascular leiomyomatosis and angioleiomyoma. There is also a very rare malignant form-leiomyosarcoma.</p>
      <p>Vascular leiomyosarcomas arise predominantly in the inferior vena cava (IVC), and less commonly in the pulmonary arteries or veins or other peripheral vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Surgical resection is considered to be the main treatment for this disease.</p>
      <p>We present a rare case of leiomyosarcoma in the IVC with massive extension to extravascular space which was treated successfully with iodine 125 (<sup>125</sup>I) seeds implantation rather than surgery. This was considered as the best option taking account of the risk and the high rate of recurrence. Brachytherapy was planned because of consecutive radioactive effects on the tumor, lower damage to normal tissue and the definite curative effects.</p>
      <p>Despite our extensive review of English literature, we could not find any similar case of successfully treated IVC leiomyosarcoma.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 60-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with abdominal pain over the course ofthe last five days. Tenderness in the right upper abdomen was noted on physical examination. Intravenous contrast enhanced CT scan showed a mass 9 &#xD7; 6 &#xD7; 5.5 cm in size with almost complete obliteration of the IVC with a large extravascular component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). The mass was located in the suprarenal IVC with its epicenter outside of the IVC, and presented no extension to the renal vein. Exact diagnosis in this case was uncertain thus biopsy of the mass under CT guidance was performed. Histology revealed diffuse distribution of spindle cells with mild atypia in fibrous tissue. Immunohistochemical stains for smooth muscle desmin were positive and those for interstitialoma, endothelium and neurogenic tumors, including CD34, CD117, S100, nestin and Alkaline were negative, which were all consistent with the diagnosis of low-grade malignant leiomyosarcoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C, D</xref>).</p>
      <p>After informed consent from the patient and approval of the Ethics Committee of our hospital, <sup>125</sup>I seeds implantation of the mass by posterior approach under CT guidance was performed. Three days before <sup>125</sup>I seeds implantation, the patient underwent a detailed tumor volume study using CT scans with slice thickness of 5 mm. A radiation oncologist outlined the gross tumor volume (GTV) and marked areas at risk for subclinical disease on each transverse image. The planning target volume (PTV) included the entire GTV and 0.5-1.0 cm margins. The dose was prescribed as the minimal peripheral dose (MPD) encompassing the PTV. The distribution, MPD of <sup>125</sup>I seeds and dose volume histogram (DVH) were calculated using computerized treatment planning system (RT-RSI, Beijing Atom and High Technique Industries Inc., Beijing, China).</p>
      <p>Lead protective bucket, vest, apron, spectacles and gloves were used by the operator and the assistants. Puncture region was marked based on the CT image. Following local anesthesia with 0.5% lidocaine and sedation with pethidine hydrochloride and promethazine hydrochloride, eighteen-gauge needles were placed via posterior paraspinal approach or through the space between right kidney and the vertebraes. The procedure included 2-3 steps under CT guidance in a parallel array of 1.0 to 1.5 cm apart, and extended at least 0.5-1.0 cm beyond the GTV. <sup>125</sup>I seeds (Jaco pharmaceuticals CO. LTD, Ningbo, China, t1/2: 59.6 days, energy level: 27.4-31.4. keV) were implanted using a Jaco applicator and Radiation-proof implanting needles (Hakko trading CO. LTD., Shanghai, China). The space between seeds (center to center) was kept at 1.0 cm. 30 seeds were implanted with an activity of 0.8 mCi. The distribution and uniformity of the <sup>125</sup>Iodine seeds in the lesion and drifting seeds analysis was done under the CT scan. The total procedure lasted 60 minutes, and the dose burden of radiation was 10 mSv under CT guidance.</p>
      <p>Abdominal pain of the patient was relieved in one month after the procedure was performed. Three months later, a follow-up CT examination showed that the size of tumor was decreased, although a cold area was noted at the posterior margin. A second <sup>125</sup>I seeds implantation by latero-posterior approach through the lateral space of right kidney under CT guidance was then performed and 30 0.8 mci <sup>125</sup>I seeds were introduced into the cold area. After the 2nd session of brachytherapy the course was uneventful and the patient remained in the hospital for 5 days for observation of any unexpected complications. No procedure-related complications were observed. Three months later, CT examination showed high density <sup>125</sup>I seeds surrounding the IVC and the previous space-occupying mass disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>
      <p>Five months after the last CT examination the patient was readmitted with lower abdominal pain and presence of lower leg edema. Inferior vena cavography showed narrowing and partial IVC obstruction at L2-3 level, with retroperitoneal collateral circulation in keeping with IVC thrombosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). After anticoagulant and thrombolytic therapy for one week, cavoplasty was performed with balloons of 5 &#xD7; 40 mm and 20 &#xD7; 40 mm consecutively. After angioplasty, the diameter of IVC segment was about 20 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). The patient was free of symptoms five days after the procedure. 2.5 mg warfarin per day was used as anticoagulant therapy for the next 3 months.</p>
      <p><sup>125</sup>I seeds implantation and balloon cavoplasty worked very well in this patient. At follow-up, the patient was free of symptoms and CT scan showed disappearance of the tumor and no recurrence for 33 months after the 2nd session of brachytherapy, with no thrombosis in the IVC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Vascular smooth muscle tumors are rare, including benign and malignant forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Leiomyosarcomas of vascular origin, the malignant form, arise most frequently in the IVC. It is most commonly detected in women in their sixth decade, and presents with 3 main growth patterns: 62% of the cases demonstrate extraluminal, 5% intraluminal, and 33% extra- and intraluminal growth patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p>
      <p>Leiomyosarcomas of the IVC are classified into 3 groups according to the localization in the IVC. Upper segment involvement extends to the level of the renal veins and lower segment involvesthe infrarenal portion. The percentages of upper, middle, and lower section involvement are 24%, 42%, and 34%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p>
      <p>Modern imaging modalities using computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, cavography, ultrasound, and positron emission tomography allow for an accurate preoperative diagnosis of tumor extension and resectability. Despite advanced imaging technologies, the final diagnosis is still requires pathological assessment. Histopathology of leiomyosarcoma reveals spindle tumor cells, which are positive for markers of smooth muscle activity including vimentin, muscle actin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and desmin. Malignancy is indicated by variable cell size and shapes and increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio.</p>
      <p>Since the experiene with this disease is very limited, the optimal management of IVC leiomyosarcoma is unestablished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). At present aggressive surgical therapy is recommended by most authors. En-bloc resection demands primary tumor extirpation and resection of involved adjacent structures, with or without caval reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Major disadvantage of surgery is the high rate of recurrence. Cho and colleagues reported a mortality rate of approximately 11.11%, and recurrence rate of 44.45% after surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p>
      <p>As for adjuvant therapy, radiation treatment is generally considered beneficial. Preoperative external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) could facilitate marginally negative resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), and postoperative radiation treatment can diminish local recurrence and may improve survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). However, EBRT can not avoid normal tissue effectively, and there are difficulties regarding the dose of radiation. In three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) high concentration of dose radiation conforms to PTV and sparing normal adjacent tissue is delivered compared with EBRT. This in turn leans to minimal radiation to the surrounding normal tissues is minimal. However, 3D-CRT is a sophisticated technique compared with brachytherapy which is a relative simple technique.</p>
      <p>The use of postoperative chemotherapy has long been recommended for these types of patients, although evidence for the efficacy of this treatment is sparse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Preoperative chemotherapy has rarely allowed significant improvement permitting surgical resection, and definitive role of postoperative chemotherapy showed no positive impact in Hines et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). No study or report has demonstrated a consistent advantage of chemotherapy for these patients.</p>
      <p>Brachytherapy is an established method of safely providing adjuvant local radiotherapy used alone or in combination with resection for prostate cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer and soft tissue sarcomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Compared with external beam irradiation, it spares more normal tissue and permits irradiation of the tumor bed in the immediate postoperative period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Brachytherapy options include low dose rate techniques with iridium 192 or iodine 125, fractionated high dose rate brachytherapy, and intraoperative high dose rate therapy. <sup>125</sup>I seeds are characterized by a long half life period and low quantity of radiant energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). For certain tumors, consecutive radiotherapy can be performed by implanting <sup>125</sup>I seeds, and the curative effects are better than external radiotherapy. As a kind of brachytherapy, <sup>125</sup>I seeds implantation shows simplicity, safety and effectiveness in the treatment of primary, metastatic and recurrent malignant tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p>
      <p>Brachytheraphy was used to treat primary leiomyosarcoma of the lungs, uterus, rectum and prostate. To the best of our knowledge, no brachytherapy in the treatment of vascular leiomyosarcoma has been reported.</p>
      <p>We present a rare case of IVC leiomyosarcoma, which protruded mainly to the extravascular space and adjoined aorta, liver, duodenum and kidney. In this case, surgical procedure may be hazardous and life-threatening, which is associated with a high rate of recurrence. EBRT was excluded as it might cause skin injury and radiation enterocolitis. Based on our previous experience with <sup>125</sup>I seeds implantation in malignant soft tissue tumors, brachytherapy and balloon dilatation combined with anticoagulant therapy were applied in this case. Considering the immediate positive results of the procedure, it was decided not to implement an IVC stent. Pre-procedure administration of anticoagulant agent and thrombolytics remarkably decreased the risks of thrombus migration, therefore implantation of retrievable IVC filter was ignored. Chemotherapy was not applied because the patient refused adjuvant treatment.</p>
      <p>A rare case of primary leiomyosarcoma of the IVC with large intra and extravascular component is presented in this case report. Brachytheraphy is a relatively simple procedure and was applied in this case with excellent results. This success may possibly be attributed in part to the low grade type of the tumor. However, more experience is needed to establish the value of brachytherapy in the treatment of IVC leiomyosarcoma.</p>
