        <p>This article reports the orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning carried out
with a 14-year and 5-month-old female patient with esthetic and functional
complaints. She presented an Angle Class I malocclusion, anterior crossbite and
severe crowding in both maxillary and mandibular arches, in addition to a lightly
concave straight facial profile. Orthodontic treatment did not require extraction.
Crossbite was corrected by protrusion of upper teeth, which contributed to alignment
and leveling of teeth, in addition to improving the patient's facial profile. The
case was presented to the Brazilian Board of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics
(BBO) as a requirement for the BBO certification.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>A 14-year and 5-month-old patient, in good health, with controlled allergic rhinitis,
showed up for her first appointment. Her mother reported that the patient fell when she
was eight years old, and fractured the incisal edge of tooth #41. At that point, the
tooth was partially restored and remained as so with neither apical radiolucency nor
sensibility until her first orthodontic appointment. The patient avoided smiling and
showing her teeth while talking. Her major complaints comprised lack of space in both
maxillary and mandibular arches and anterior crossbite. The patient reported the
following: "<italic>I am embarrassed of smiling. I want to have my teeth fixed because
they are not aligned, which makes it difficult to bite</italic>." The patient was in
the descending pubertal growth spurt curve, 24 months after menarche. Her dental history
included good oral hygiene, unchanged tongue position during physiologic movements and
no orthodontic treatment.</p>

      <title>DIAGNOSIS</title>
      <p>The patient was an adolescent in the residual growth phase.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> She presented an asymmetrical face, with proportional
facial thirds and spontaneous lip seal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig 1</xref>).
She avoided smiling and showing her teeth, which hindered the assessment of spontaneous
smile and the amount of tooth exposure at smile. Her forced smile revealed that her
upper lip covered the gingival margin of her upper incisors.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="dpjo-19-02-0115-g01"/>
      </fig>
      <p>The patient had a straight facial profile, with thin, retracted lips in relation to the
Nasolabial line (S-UL = -1.0 mm and S-LL = 0 mm).<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
      <p>From a dental point of view, she presented Angle Class I malocclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">2</xref>),
although her upper and lower canines were in end-to-end anteroposterior relationship.
Additionally, she presented severe crowding in the maxillary and mandibular arches
(maxillary discrepancy of -10 mm and mandibular discrepancy of -6 mm), and anterior
crossbite including #11 and #22. Overjet between #21 and #31 was +3 mm, and -3 mm
between #11 and #41. Tooth #41 was fractured and partially restored, given that
restoration could not be properly carried out due to lack of space resulting from the
malocclusion. Oral hygiene was good.</p>

      <p>Panoramic and periapical radiographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig 3</xref>)
revealed good root formation for all teeth, absence of apical radiolucencies around
tooth #41 as well as absence of bone or dental anomalies. She had unerupted third molars
at Nolla's stage 6 (initial root formation).</p>

      <p>Cephalometric cephalograms and tracings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Fig 4</xref>)

-0.5&#xBA;), with a predominantly horizontal growth pattern and mandibular plane (SN-GoGn =
25&#xBA;, FMA = 20&#xBA; and Y Axis = 54&#xBA;). Upper and lower incisors were retroclined (1-NA = 20&#xBA;,
1-NA = 6 mm, 1-NB = 17&#xBA;, 1-NB = 4 mm and IMPA = 83.5&#xBA;).The aforementioned cephalometric
data are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>.</p>

      <title>TREATMENT PLAN</title>
      <p>The patient had a harmonious and proportional face (front view), but presented a
straight profile, which is worrying for a 14-year-old, given that one's profile tends to
become more concave with time.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> For this reason, treatment plan avoided
extractions and included protrusion of retroclined incisors, as well as increasing lip
support and volume, which resulted in a more convex profile.</p>
      <p>The patient presented Angle Class I malocclusion, with anterior crossbite of teeth #11
and #22. Given that her central mandibular and maxillary incisors were retroclined,
treatment plan aimed at obtaining mesio-distal space by means of a fixed orthodontic
appliance, providing protrusion of anterior teeth in normal occlusion, increased arch
circumference, and protrusion of maloccluded teeth in order to meet normal
standards.<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Negative discrepancy
was severe in both maxillary (-10 mm) and mandibular arches (-6 mm). Mandibular canines
were visibly retroclined, with reduced distance between canines. Protrusion of maxillary
and mandibular incisors was able to solve such negative discrepancy and increase the
distance between canines and molars in both maxillary and mandibular arches,
particularly in the mandibular canines.</p>
      <p>An alternative treatment plan would include extraction of the four first premolars. This
treatment option, however, does not allow enough protrusion of incisors and, as a
result, does not improve lip support. Moreover, after some years, it would worsen the
patient's facial profile.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>

      <title>TREATMENT PROGRESS</title>
      <p>Edgewise 0.022 x 0.028-in orthodontic brackets were placed in the maxillary arch, except
for teeth #11 and 22 (maloccluded). Treatment began with Twist-flex 0.015-in steel
archwire placed for initial alignment and leveling. Subsequently, 0.012, 0.014, 0.016
and 0.018-in stainless steel archwires were progressively installed every 30 days, with
omega loops mesially adjusted to the first molars. The omega loops were adjusted in 0.05
mm on each side on every orthodontic visit, increasing arch circumference and length,
and, as a result, establishing mild and continuous protrusion of incisors with expansion
of the arches.</p>
      <p>Once the 0.018-in steel wire had been installed, open springs were compressed between
teeth #11 and 22 to create space between them. At this point, orthodontic appliance was
installed on these teeth. Buccal traction of maloccluded teeth was performed with
mild-force elastomeric chains between the 0.018" arch and the bonded appliances. At this
stage, maxillary incisors were slightly protruded, thus providing enough space to
correct the malocclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig 5</xref>). By the time the
0.020" stainless steel wire was installed, the incisors had been satisfactory protruded,
thus providing enough mesiodistal space for buccal inclination of #11 and #22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f06">Fig 6</xref>).</p>

      </fig>
      <p>After maloccluded teeth were corrected, the appliances of #11 e #22 were replaced and a
new 0.014" stainless steel wire was installed for teeth alignment and leveling.
Subsequently, 0.016, 0.018, 0.020-in and 0.019 x 0.025-in stainless steel wires were
progressively installed for individual torque control and treatment finishing.</p>
      <p>Edgewise 0.022 x 0.028-in orthodontic brackets were placed in all teeth of the maxillary
arch. It is worth noting that on teeth #31, 33 and 43, the appliances were provisionally
bonded in a more cervical direction so as to avoid occlusal contact with antagonist
teeth. The occlusal bracket wings of teeth #35, 44 and 45 had to be partially worn after
bonding due to occlusal interference. Initially, a 0.015-in Twist-flex steel alignment
and leveling archwire was installed. Subsequently, 0.012, 0.014, 0.016-in and 0.018-in
stainless steel archwires were progressively installed every 30 days, with omega loops
mesially adjusted to the first molars. Similarly and concurrently to the maxillary arch,
the omega loops were adjusted in 0.05 mm on each side, increasing arch circumference and
length, and, as a result, establishing mild and continuous protrusion of incisors.</p>
      <p>As protrusion of upper and lower incisors progressed, more space was created for
rebonding of teeth #31, 33 and 43 which, as it has been previously mentioned, were
initially bonded in a non-ideal position. These teeth were rebonded on an average of
three to four times, until their ideal position (in comparison to the other teeth) could
be reached. After the 0.019 x 0.025-in stainless steel rectangular archwire was
installed, with it acting over the torques and establishing correct intercuspation, the
appliance was removed.</p>
      <p>Retention consisted of a wraparound removable appliance in the maxillary arch, used
full-time (except for meals and oral hygiene) during six months, 12 hours per day during
the following six months and while sleeping during the last six months of retention.
After a retention period of a year and a half, the patient was advised to use the
maxillary retainer two nights a week while sleeping for an indefinite period of
time.</p>
      <p>In the mandibular arch, a 0.020-in stainless steel wire intercanine bar was installed to
ease incisors and canines interproximal space. This retainer was used for an indefinite
period of time. Third molars were extracted six months before treatment completion.</p>

      <title>RESULTS</title>
      <p>At treatment completion, patient's self-esteem had significantly improved. Good facial
proportions were observed in frontal view, with patient's profile improved due to an
increase in lip volume as a result of incisor protrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f07">Fig 7</xref>). Horizontal residual mandibular growth was greater than expected,
given that menarche had occurred one year and a half before treatment onset. If incisor
protrusion had not been planned, patient's profile would be clearly concave. Protrusion
allowed patient's profile to favorably develop with age.<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>

      <p>Molar and canine relationships were obtained in key to occlusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f07">Figs 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f08">8</xref>). Anterior
crossbite and discrepancy of upper and lower models were corrected by protrusion of
upper and lower incisors and mild expansion of the arches (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">Tab 2</xref>).The distance between lower molars increased in 2 mm, while
the distance between upper molars increased in 3 mm during treatment. As for the
distance between lower canines, it increased in 5 mm, whereas between upper canines, it
increased in 1.5 mm. The greater increase in distance between lower canines was a result
of accentuated lingual inclination of teeth #33 and 43, which was corrected during
treatment.<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The average distance
between lower canines in untreated patients is 25 mm, whereas in the case reported
herein it was of 22 mm. Normal overjet and overbite were obtained with anterior
disocclusion guides on the incisors, and lateral disocclusion guides on right and left
canines.</p>

      <p>Final panoramic radiograph revealed root parallelism, whereas periapical radiographs
revealed absence of root resorption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f09">Fig 9</xref>).
During treatment, restoration of tooth #41 was recommended. However, the dentist advised
the patient to wait for treatment completion in order to have such procedure carried
out. At treatment completion, tooth #41 presented apical radiolucencies, as revealed by
the final periapical radiograph, and the patient was referred to a specialist for
endodontic treatment and restoration of tooth #41, all of which were carried out one
month after the orthodontic appliance had been removed. Radiographic control taken six
months afterwards revealed periapical repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig

      <p>At treatment completion, the mandible was more anteriorly positioned in relation to the
maxilla, with ANB = -1&#xBA; and angle of convexity = 0.5&#xBA;, both clinically acceptable. The
mandibular plane revealed mild anticlockwise movement, observed by a reduction in the
mandibular plane angles (SN-GoGn and FMA) and Y Axis.</p>
      <p>Cephalometric tracing superimposition revealed that, during treatment, mandibular growth
in the horizontal direction of the maxilla was greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f12">Fig 12</xref>), which could be explained by the reduced anterior movement of point A
in relation to point B, showing little maxillary growth in relation to the maxilla as a
result of the buccal inclination of maxillary incisors. An increase in the inclination
of maxillary incisors, with palatal root movement as a consequence, may have been
influenced by the posterior positioning of point A, giving the false impression of
insufficient maxillary growth.</p>

      <p>The results were obtained as planned: excellent facial esthetics, anterior teeth in
normal occlusion and improvements in alignment and leveling. The patient demonstrated to
be satisfied with the results, which improved her self-esteem.</p>
      <p>In spite of the anterior displacement of the mandible being greater than expected,
patient's profile remained straight as a result of protrusion of incisors, which
provided lip support and volume with excellent esthetics. Key to occlusion was obtained
for molars and canines with ideal occlusion guides.</p>
