      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The actual incidence of foreign bodies retained in the abdominal cavity is not well
known, as such cases are under-reported<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. They occur even with highly experienced surgeons and may cause
serious consequences. Related risk factors require the adoption of systematic preventive
measures<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>This paper aims to report a case involving a surgical sponge abandoned after
cholecystectomy that migrated into the duodenum and was successfully removed by upper
digestive endoscopy.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 26-year-old female patient underwent videolaparoscopic cholecystectomy converting to
open surgery due to choledocholithiasis. Choledocholithotomy plus Kehr drainage was then
performed. The patient had a good recovery, but after nine months she sought medical
care presenting antropyloric obstruction syndrome (epigastric pain, recurrent
postprandial vomiting, and weight loss).</p>
      <p>Upper digestive endoscopy revealed the presence of a foreign body, probably a surgical
sponge, in the gastric cavity, in the transpyloric region, blocking the passage of the
equipment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1A</xref>). Abdominal CT scan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1B</xref>) revealed a well-defined mass located
between the liver and the stomach, with mixed density, air bubbles in its inside, and
spiral radiopaque stripes representing the sponge markers.</p>
      <fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float">

        </caption>
        <graphic xlink:href="abcd-27-04-0310-g01"/>
      </fig>
      <p>With a diagnostic hypothesis of pyloric obstruction caused by a foreign body, a new
upper digestive endoscopy was performed in an attempt to remove the sponge, which was
successfully done by snare polypectomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure
2A</xref>). After the removal of the foreign body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure
2B</xref>) superficial esophageal lacerations were observed with self-limited
bleeding and a blocked deep ulcer occupying almost all the anterior wall of the duodenal
bulb, with no signs of cavity perforation.</p>
      <fig id="f02" orientation="portrait" position="float">
        <label>Figure 2</label>
        <caption>

        </caption>
        <graphic xlink:href="abcd-27-04-0310-g02"/>
      </fig>
      <p>The patient had a good recovery. Medicated with proton-pump inhibitors, she accepted
oral feeding in the room one day after endoscopy. On the 8<sup>th</sup> day, a control
upper digestive endoscopy showed that the ulcer size decreased with signs of
cicatrization. The patient was then discharged from the hospital.</p>
      <p>A new control endoscopy performed two months after discharge revealed undeformed
duodenum and intact normal mucosa.</p>
      <p>The patient presented no symptoms in the last appointment, 10 months after the removal
of the foreign body.</p>

    <sec sec-type="discussion">
      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Foreign bodies retained in the abdominal cavity are not always reported, as this may
carry legal medical implications. As a consequence, their real incidence is unknown. It
is estimated that there is one case in every 500 to 1500 intra-abdominal surgeries, that
is, an incidence of approximately 0,15% to 0,2%.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Textile materials (gauze dressings and sponges) are the most commonly abandoned or
unintentionally left foreign bodies in the abdominal cavity. The set comprising the
foreign body and the surrounding tissue reaction is called gossypiboma or
textiloma<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Risk factors for foreign objects retained in the abdominal cavity are said to include:
emergency surgeries, hemorrhage, operatory procedures altered from those initially
proposed, participation of more than one surgical team during the procedure, the absence
of number listings of surgical sponges and instruments, unsatisfactory anesthesia,
inadequate material and infrastructure, surgeon's or team's tiredness, incomplete
surgical teams, and obesity<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. This
case report presents an initially videolaparoscopic cholecystectomy converted to
laparotomy due to choledocholithiasis.</p>
      <p>There are three possibilities of evolution in the natural history of foreign bodies
retained in the abdominal cavity: 1) to be encapsulated by the reactive inflammatory
fibrotic process with our without the formation of an abscess or fistula; 2) to be
removed by surgical incision; or 3) to migrate into the lumen of a hollow viscera
(intestines, bladder, or vagina)<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The clinical picture varies greatly, as it depends on the type of reaction triggered by
the organism in response to the presence of the foreign body. If a foreign body becomes
encapsulated by the inflammatory process, it may have an asymptomatic evolution and be
found in an imaging test in 30% of the cases. It may manifest itself as a poorly-defined
palpable tumor or present intra-cavity abscess signs and symptoms<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>If the foreign body migrates to the intestinal lumen, the sick patient may present
abdominal pain, or show signs of intestinal occlusion or sub-occlusion, or even excrete
it via feces<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>CT scan is the gold standard diagnostic test for gossypiboma. Its features include
spiral radiopaque stripes found in sponge markers and the spongiform appearance of the
tumor with small air bubbles in its inside<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. A Ultrasonography and
simple abdominal radiography can also suspect a diagnosis of a retained foreign
object.</p>
      <p>The treatment for retained foreign bodies in the abdominal cavity may be expectant when
concomitantly the patient is asymptomatic and the surgery was performed a long time ago,
with no signs of abscesses, or when its migration to the intestinal lumen indicates a
spontaneous resolution<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The removal
of the foreign body is recommended when it is associated with relevant signs and
symptoms or when diagnosis is made on the first days after surgery<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. This procedure may be done by
conventional surgery, using a laparoscopic or even endoscopic approach<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, as in the case described here.</p>
      <p>Preventive measures should be implemented to reduce its occurrence, such as: 1) the
placement of Pean clamps on surgical sponge tapes, positioning them out of the abdominal
cavity; 2 surgical sponge counting procedures (although this is not a fool-proof
indicator as studies show cases in which counting was regarded as correct and even so
sponges remained in the abdominal cavity); 3) after being given to a surgeon, a gauze
dressing is supposed to be immediately returned to the surgical technologist's hands; 4)
cavity inventory before closure; 5) use of radiopaque markers for textile materials; and
6) in case of doubt about a possible retention, radiography must be done in the
operating room<sup>2</sup>.</p>
      <p>As for legal medical implications, abandoning foreign bodies in surgical procedures may
result in civil and criminal charges. Naturally, medical errors must be investigated and
considered in all dimensions. Generally, they are characterized as negligence<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Peer group attitudes must not cover up
grave medical errors and negligent professionals.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, it is unacceptable to prejudge and publicly execrate the medical
professional without taking into account critical emergency situations, extensive
surgeries, unsatisfactory conditions of the surgical environment, etc., all of which
factors that may influence the conduction of the surgical procedure.</p>
