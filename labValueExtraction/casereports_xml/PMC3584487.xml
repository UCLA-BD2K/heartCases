      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Myotonia refers to impaired muscle relaxation following a voluntary forceful
contraction. It is found in several clinical disorders with different etiologies.
One of these disorders, Myotonia Congenita (MC), is an inherited myotonia due to a
mutation in the skeletal muscle chloride channel CLCN1. A defect in CLCN-1 (a gene
coding for the chloride channel ClC-1) leads to reduced sarcolemmal chloride
conductance, which in turn allows the muscle to be hyperpolarized, causing delayed
relaxation evident as clinical and electrical myotonia. Affected patients will
describe muscle stiffness after initiating a forceful movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. MC is found in dominant and
recessive forms. The recessive form is usually more severe and is known as Becker
Myotonia Congenita or the Becker variant. The dominant form varies in severity from
asymptomatic to moderately severe and is known as Thomsen Myotonia Congenita or the
Thomsen variant. These two forms may be distinguished by clinical presentation,
inheritance pattern, and time of onset. Patients affected by the Thomsen variant do
not characteristically show any significant muscle hypertrophy, but it can present
in infancy or adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Patients with the Becker variant
usually present during childhood, show pronounced muscle hypertrophy, and typically
have transient (and occasionally permanent) weakness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p>

        <title>Patient 1: Becker variant</title>
        <p>DM is a 5-year-old male who first presented to the Yale-New Haven Pediatric
Clinic between the ages of 2 and 3 years old with delayed gross motor milestones
and difficulty getting into standing position. There was no history of any
neurologic, developmental, or muscle diseases in his family. There was no
evidence of consanguinity in the family. His pregnancy and birth history were
unremarkable. On physical examination, he was found to have prominent calves and
forearms, an awkward gait, and he ran poorly. He arose from the floor in a slow,
stiff fashion, but without the classical Gower&#x2019;s sign. He was able to jump,
climb stairs, and climb into a chair without difficulty. He had good muscle
strength, normal tone, brisk reflexes, and flexor plantar responses, as well as
intact sensation, fine motor, vision, hearing, and cranial nerves. CK was
measured at 175 (24-195). A muscle biopsy was performed (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>,and
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) that showed scattered areas of
atrophic and hypotrophic fibers with relative increase in endomysial connective
tissue on H &amp; E staining and predominance of type 2 fibers on ATPase
staining with hypotrophic fibers being either type 1 or type 2 but the
occasional hypertrophic / hypercontracted fiber being predominantly type 2.</p>
        <p>By the time the patient was 4 years and 6 months of age, it was reported that he
&#x201C;gets stiffer after immobility but can walk it off.&#x201D; Cold temperatures did not
seem to worsen or alter these symptoms. Physical exam revealed muscle prominence
and grip myotonia followed by transient weakness. Eyelid myotonia was not
clearly present. An EMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) was
performed and showed multiple runs of spontaneous positive wave discharges that
varied in both frequency and amplitude and lasted approximately 2 to 5 seconds
each. Subsequent CLCN1 DNA sequencing showed a homozygous transversion in
nucleotide position 936 (codon 312) of C to G, resulting in an amino acid change
of serine to arginine.</p>
        <p>At 5 years of age, he complained of difficulty writing and repeated falls as well
as periods where his legs got stiff and he was unable to walk. He denied
injuries but reported bruises on his shins. Further review of systems was
unremarkable. He was now able to run and go up stairs without difficulty.
Physical exam revealed muscle prominence in calves, thighs, biceps, triceps, and
neck muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Grip myotonia but
no eyelid myotonia was elicited.</p>

      <sec id="s2b">
        <title>Patient 2: Thomsen variant</title>
        <p>DT is a 59-year-old male with a self-reported history of Thomsen variant Myotonia
Congenita who presented to the Yale-New Haven Clinic for further evaluation. The
patient reported muscle cramping starting at a younger age and was diagnosed
with MC while in the military. The patient had reportedly managed his symptoms
of cramping by simply keeping &#x201C;warm and dry.&#x201D; On presentation, the patient
denied lid myotonia, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, numbness, or tingling.
Physical exam revealed normal cranial nerve function without eyelid myotonia.
There was full strength throughout with mild grip and percussion myotonia.
Reflexes, sensation, and cerebellar testing were unremarkable. Past medical
history was significant for broken teeth secondary to the myotonia. Family
history revealed similar symptoms of &#x201C;cramping&#x201D; in his father and a daughter
(both without confirmed genetic diagnosis). EMG showed myotonic discharges
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) with multiple runs of
spontaneous positive wave discharges that varied in both frequency and amplitude
and lasted approximately 2 to 3 seconds. The patient had been put on quinine and
phenytoin to improve his myotonia symptoms in the past; however, both
medications were stopped secondary to cognitive side effects. CLCN1 DNA
sequencing showed a heterozygous transition in nucleotide position 593 (codon
198) of T to C, resulting in an amino acid change of leucine to proline. DMPK
(DM1), ZNF9 (DM2) and SCN4A genes showed no DNA sequence variants.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Myotonia Congenita (MC) is a musculoskeletal disorder whose identity in the research
world first emerged with the seminal studies by Bryant, Lipicky, and colleagues in
the early 1960s, which described deficient muscle chloride conductance
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. The first CLCN1 mutations for both recessive and autosomal
dominant MC were discovered in the early 1990s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Although
this specific form of myotonia continues to be rare, researchers have come to know
much more about the pathophysiologic, molecular, and genetic basis through various
studies performed over the years. While it is well established that the basis of MC
pathology is a mutation in the CLCN1 muscle chloride channel, multiple studies show
that there is much variability in the way this mutation may present. In 2008, Lossin
et al. reported as many as 130 mutations in this gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Different mutations have resulted in either dominant
or recessive forms of myotonia, yet no two individuals with dominant or recessive
inheritance will necessarily present the same way. In fact, presentation even varies
greatly in one family line or even from day to day in one person [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. It has been hypothesized that this
variability may be attributed to variable expressivity, incomplete penetrance,
impact of mutants alleles on wild type channel proteins, allelic expression, and
intrinsic variability of channel dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. This variability has not only made it hard for
physicians to diagnose MC in certain cases, but has also led to an inability to
support genetic, physiologic, and molecular hypotheses surrounding MC, all of which
could potentially result in better treatment methods. The most common reported
mutation in North America associated with the Thomsen variant is a nonconservative
substitution of glycine-230 with glutamic acid (G230E) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. The two most frequently discovered alleles in patients with the
Becker variant are the missense mutation F413C and a 14-bp deletion leading to a
frameshift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Today, the number of different mutations and
secondarily phenotypic presentations continue to multiply as evidenced by our case
report.</p>
      <p>As mentioned previously, myotonia as a symptom has many different etiologies.
Clinical history, inheritance pattern, and review of systems are all important to
distinguish one cause of myotonia from another. Temperature effects, age of onset,
and symptoms of predominant or transient weakness help in working through the
differential etiologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>].
Diagnostic studies such as electromyography (EMG) and molecular genetic testing
usually allow an easy diagnosis of MC. In this way, we were able to confirm the
diagnoses of both patients in this case report. Patient 1 (DM) has the classically
described phenotype of the Becker variant and evidence clinically of muscle
hypertrophy and grip myotonia, which was confirmed with electromyography.
Additionally, Patient 1&#x2019;s muscle biopsy showed a predominance of type 2 fibers,
which is consistent with previous reports of muscle biopsies of patients with
myotonia congenita [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].
Patient 2 (DT) has a family history consistent with an autosomal dominant pattern of
inheritance, and both grip and percussion myotonia were confirmed with
electromyography. Additionally, Patient 2 had normal sequencing of the other
myotonia associated genes, DMPK (DM1), ZNF9 (DM2), and SCN4A. Finally, the described
mutations in the CLCN1 gene, homozygous C936G (Ser312Arg) mutation in Patient 1 and
the heterozygous T593C (Leu198Pro) mutation in Patient 2, are compatible with the
known recessive and dominant inheritance patterns of myotonia congenita,
respectively.</p>
      <p>Though a small subtype of all myotonias, MC research has focused on the clinical
presentation, molecular physiology, and genetics. One of the recurrent themes in the
research is that MC has variable expressivity affecting the phenotypic presentation.
Though many hypotheses have been suggested to explain this, they are not supported
by scientific evidence. The trend seems to be that one explanation cannot be used
for all mutations. Recent studies investigating the pathology of the CLCN1 channel
continue to show this pattern. In 2011, Tang et al. suggested that mutations are
scattered throughout the entire protein sequence and no clear relationship exists
between the inheritance pattern of the mutation and the location of the mutation in
the channel protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. The
inheritance pattern of some mutants can be explained by &#x201C;dominant negative&#x201D; effect
on the channel gate; however, this does not apply to all mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>Further attempts to explain these findings have led to studies of channelopathies as
a whole. In a study of severity of muscle channelopathies, Duno et al. hypothesized
that homozygotes show more severe clinical features and compound muscle action
potential changes; the presence of 100 percent defective ion channels in homozygotes
accounts for the most severe phenotype when compared to heterozygotes of the same
mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. This is
supported by the known fact that recessive MC is associated with more severe muscle
stiffness than the dominant form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. However, this information is not specific enough or useful to
determine better treatment methods or allow earlier diagnoses in patients affected
by MC.</p>
      <p>Although EMG is very helpful as a diagnostic tool, it is not capable of
differentiating MC from other myotonias on its own [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Even molecular genetic testing, the emerging
diagnostic tool, has its limitations, and in the case of certain mutations, it
cannot completely rule out MC. Several protocols using EMG to enhance the diagnostic
sensitivity and specificity of the myotonic disorders have been suggested. Long and
short exercise tests at room temperature after cooling and re-warming have been
described, and the short exercise tests aided in accurate DNA based diagnosis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Another proposed
method involved repetitive nerve stimulation at 3Hz, which, in an Italian cohort of
patients affected by recessive MC, showed high sensitivity and reproducibility in
detecting recessive cases. All dominant cases and patients affected by myotonia not
due to the CLCN1 mutation showed negative results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Although not discussed in detail in this case
report, histological muscle biopsy features also have a role and may aid in
diagnosis.</p>
      <p>It is our hope that these two previously undescribed mutations in the CLCN1 genes
will add to the growing database of CLCN1 variants linked to myotonia congenita and
help elucidate some of the polymorphisms associated with this disease and these
specific mutations.</p>

        <p>EMG Representation. Myotonia is characterized by increased insertional activity
and continued high frequency discharges. The motor unit response is much greater
than that of a healthy subject by several seconds that can be incited by
tapping, needle movement, or voluntary contraction. Audio feedback during EMG
can be described as similar to sounds produced by propeller dive bomber in World
War II. The length of time of repetitive discharged correlated with delayed
muscle relaxation. This is an electrophysiological hallmark of MC.</p>
