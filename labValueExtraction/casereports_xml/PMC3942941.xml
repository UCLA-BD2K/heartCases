        <p>We report here the clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and
successful surgical management associated with triceps tendon avulsion in a dog. A
definitive diagnosis of triceps tendon avulsion was made based on MRI with evidence of
displacement of the triceps tendon. Surgical correction of triceps tendon avulsion was
performed with two horizontal mattress sutures using polyester and two tunnels drilled in
the olecranon to reattach the tendon to the proximal olecranon. At 9 months, there was no
evidence of lameness on the left thoracic limb. This is the first case report to describe
MRI evaluation for the diagnosis of the triceps tendon avulsion.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Rupture or avulsion of the triceps tendon is a rarely reported tendinous injury in the dog
and cat. Traumatic lacerations and avulsions are usually associated with tendon injuries
[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In
humans, triceps tendon rupture represents less than 1% of all upper extremity tendon injuries
[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. To the authors&#x2019; knowledge, rupture or avulsion
of the triceps tendon in the dog or cat has been described in only few case reports [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The purpose of
this case report is to describe the clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
findings and successful surgical management associated with avulsion of triceps tendon in a
dog. This is the first case report to describe MRI evaluation for the diagnosis of the triceps
tendon avulsion.</p>
    <p>A 3 kg, 3-year-old, intact female Pomeranian dog presented a sudden lameness after jumping
off furniture in the left thoracic limb during two months. The lameness was not resolved with
a 2-month course of a combination of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and Robert Jones
bandage. Six weeks prior to presentation, the dog showed non-weight bearing. On physical
examination, the dog showed a non-weight-bearing lameness of the left thoracic limb. Palpation
of the left elbow and the distal humeral region revealed a painful, swollen elbow joint and a
limited range of motion in the elbow joint with a firm mass proximal to the olecranon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Preoperative findings of the left distal humeral region and proximal olecranon. A firm
mass (dotted line) proximal to the olecranon and swollen elbow joint (arrow) are
identified.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-75-1375-g001"/></fig>). Atrophy of all heads of the triceps muscle was obvious. Neurological function was
normal. Routine blood examination consisting of hemogram and serum biochemistry was
unremarkable. Radiographic evaluation revealed swelling on the left elbow joint and a fleck
sign on the left olecranon region of the insertion of the triceps tendon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Mediolateral radiographic views of the left elbow joint. Note swelling on the elbow
joint and a fleck sign (arrow) on the olecranon region of the insertion of the triceps
tendon.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-75-1375-g002"/></fig>). The dog was premedicated for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with midazolam (Vascam
inj, Hana Pharm. Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea) and butorphanol (Butorphan<sup>&#xAE;</sup>, Myungmoon
Pharm. Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea), followed by anesthetic induction with propofol (Provive
1%<sup>&#xAE;</sup>, Myungmoon Pharm. Co., Ltd.). The dog was intubated, and anesthesia was
maintained with isoflurane (Isoflurane<sup>&#xAE;</sup>; Choongwae. Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea) and
oxygen. Preoperative elbow MRI was performed on a 0.2-T (Vet-MR, Esaote, Florence, Italy)
scanner using a dual phased array coil in the prone position with neutral posture. Imaging
included sagittal T1-weighted sequences, sagittal fat-suppressed T1-weighted sequences and
sagittal contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences. T1-weighted sequences were obtained with a
spin-echo technique using 933/26 (TR range/TE range). Fat-suppressed T1-weighted sequences
were obtained with a gradient echo technique using a 90&#xB0; flip angle, 1,000/25 (TR range/TE
range) and 75 inversion time. Sagittal T1-weighted images revealed complete rupture of the
triceps tendon and olecranon bursitis that were characterized by the retracted distal triceps
tendon from the olecranon and a large amount of edema in the adjacent subcutaneous tissue,
respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Preoperative magnetic resonance images of the left (A, C) and right (B) elbow joints.
Sagittal T1-weighted imaging reveals olecranon bursitis (dotted line) and displacement
of the triceps tendon (arrow) (A). Note normal insertion of the triceps tendon (arrow)
into the proximal olecranon on sagittal T1-weighted imaging (B). There is an evidence of
high signal intensity around the elbow joint on sagittal fat-suppressed T1-weighted
image (C).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-75-1375-g003"/></fig>). There was an evidence of high signal intensity around the elbow joint on sagittal
fat-suppressed T1-weighted images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref>). A
diagnosis of traumatic triceps tendon avulsion was made.</p>
    <p>The elbow was approached surgically through a caudolateral skin incision to expose the
triceps tendon and proximal olecranon. Careful blunt dissection of subcutaneous tissues
revealed fibrous sac filled with serous fluid. Careful removal of the fibrous sac and serous
fluid allowed visualization of the avulsed tendon end and proximal olecranon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4a</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_004" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Intraoperative views of the left elbow joint. Careful removal of the fibrous sac and
serous fluid allows visualization of the avulsed tendon end (arrow) and proximal
olecranon (dotted line) (A). Two horizontal mattress sutures using polyester are placed
through the triceps tendon and two tunnels drilled in the olecranon to reattach the
tendon to the proximal olecranon (B).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-75-1375-g004"/></fig>). The tendon ends were debrided using dry gauze. Two mediolateral holes with 1 mm
diameter were drilled in the olecranon with a K-wire. Two horizontal mattress sutures using
polyester (Ethibond Excel, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Somerville, MA, U.S.A.) were placed through
the triceps tendon and two tunnels in the olecranon, respectively, to reattach the tendon to
the proximal olecranon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4b</xref>). Additionally,
several simple interrupted sutures using polyglyconate (Maxon, Covidien, Mansfield, MA,
U.S.A.) were placed between the tendon and the remaining tissues on the olecranon.
Subcutaneous tissue and skin closure was routine.</p>
    <p>The limb was supported in a spica splint for 4 weeks. After splint removal, the amount of
exercise was gradually increased with leash walks for another two weeks. Muscle atrophy still
was present; however, palpation of the left elbow joint revealed no pain and a good range of
motion. Normal limb function was regained within 7 weeks postoperatively. At 9 months, no
evidence of lameness was noted on the left thoracic limb.</p>
    <p>Previous case reports with triceps tendon avulsion describe trauma associated with a fall,
dog bite or automobile accident or local corticosteroid injection as the cause of tendon
injury [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This
trauma can be associated with a partial or complete tendon rupture that will cause various
grades of lameness. Weight bearing lameness and non-weight bearing may be suggestive of a
partial and complete rupture, respectively [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the
present report, progression of the clinical symptoms from the persistent limping to non-weight
bearing lameness suggested that the rupture of the triceps tendon might develop from a partial
injury to complete avulsion in six weeks prior to presentation.</p>
    <p>Clinical signs associated with triceps tendon avulsion involve affected limb lameness, pain,
swelling, a limited range of motion in the elbow joint, triceps muscle atrophy and a firm mass
proximal to the olecranon [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Radiographic finding includes calcific opacity in the area of the
triceps tendon [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In previous case reports with
triceps tendon avulsion, tentative diagnosis was based on clinical signs and radiographic
findings, followed by surgical exploration [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A firm mass proximal to the olecranon and calcific
opacity in the area of the triceps tendon evident on physical examination and radiographic
evaluation respectively should be necessary for the diagnosis of triceps tendon avulsion
[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the
present report, however, no evidence of calcific opacity in the area of the triceps tendon was
identified on radiographs and MRI. A fleck sign was identified on the region of the insertion
of the triceps tendon; however, bone fragment was not found proximal to the olecranon. In
previous case reports with triceps tendon avulsion, calcific opacity was evident on
radiographs obtained in relatively short term (less than 4 weeks) after traumatic incident
[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Magnetic
resonance imaging may be a helpful diagnostic tool to the cases, which have not presented
these suggestive physical and imaging evidences to diagnose olecranon bursitis and
displacement of the triceps tendon.</p>
    <p>There are a few surgical techniques described in the literature related to the reattachment
of the triceps tendon to the olecranon [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Presently
available options include a tension band fixation, horizontal mattress suture with drilled
holes in the proximal olecranon, a modified three-loop pulley suture and a Bunnell-Mayer
suture [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Tension band fixation has been described for the
management of a cat with an avulsion fracture of the proximal ulnar epiphysis [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Horizontal mattress suture technique has been described
for the management of a 20 kg dog with a complete avulsion of the triceps tendon [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In this technique, nonabsorbable sutures were placed
through the tendon and holes drilled in the proximal olecranon for the reattachment of the
triceps tendon to the proximal olecranon. A modified three-loop pulley suture technique has
been described for the management of a cat with a rupture of the triceps tendon [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In this technique, three-loop suture was placed through
the triceps tendon proximally and anchored through the tunnel in the olecranon distally with
additional horizontal mattress sutures between the tendon and the remaining tissues on the
olecranon. A Bunnell-Mayer suture technique has been described for the management of a 10 kg
dog with a complete avulsion of the triceps tendon [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].
In this technique, two holes were drilled in the olecranon from proximally to distally, and a
Bunnell-Mayer suture pattern was placed in the distal tendon and threaded through the holes in
the olecranon. In the present report, modified horizontal mattress suture technique was
performed. Two horizontal mattress sutures with two drilled holes in the proximal olecranon
provided adequate strength to maintain reattachment of the triceps tendon to the proximal
olecranon.</p>
    <p>The triceps brachii muscle consists of four heads (long, lateral, medial and accessory heads)
with a common insertional tendon to the olecranon in dogs; however, in human, the medial head
of triceps has a separate insertion that is positioned deep to the common tendon of the
lateral and long heads [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In human, MRI has been described for determining the affected tendon and
preoperative planning, since it shows whether rupture is complete or partial [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. If the injury is partial, the patient can be treated
non-operatively with splint protection for about 4 weeks at 30&#xB0; flexion [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the present MRI, it was only considered whether the rupture was
complete or partial, since dogs have one insertional common tendon to the olecranon.
Therefore, the preoperative applications of MRI to the affected canine cases will provide the
effective information for whether these cases should be treated by various types of the
surgical techniques.</p>
