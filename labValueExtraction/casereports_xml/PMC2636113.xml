  <body>
    <p>Dear Editor,</p>
    <p>A 32-year-old African-American female with type SC sickle
cell disease presented with vitreous hemorrhage in her right
eye of 2 weeks&#x2032; duration. Her visual acuity was 20/25 in the
right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. An active area of sea fan
neovascularization was noted in the superotemporal periphery
of the right eye. Vitreous hemorrhage emanating from the
lesion precluded adequate visualization of the retinal periphery
and administration of laser therapy. Over the following week,
the patient&#x2032;s vision decreased to 20/40. She was offered a
conservative course of observation until sufficient clarity could
be obtained for laser therapy, but she had become severely
anxious over perceived loss of vision and had required
psychiatric counseling.</p>
    <p>After a discussion of the potential risks and benefits of
off-label bevacizumab (Avastin) use, the patient signed a
comprehensive consent form and underwent pars plana
injection of 1.25 mg of bevacizumab. Two weeks later, her visual
acuity had returned to 20/25 and the vitreous hemorrhage
had near-completely cleared with incipient fibrosis of the
neovascular lesion. A month later, her vision was 20/20 and
examination demonstrated complete resolution of vitreous
hemorrhage with fibrous involution of the neovascular
complex. Angiography demonstrated diffuse peripheral
capillary ischemia but no areas of active neovascularization.
Laser photocoagulation was not performed. She remained
without recurrent hemorrhage or neovascularization at last
follow-up 6 months postinjection.</p>
    <p>The use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-
VEGF) therapy significantly altered the acute history of
proliferative sickle retinopathy in our patient. We might
have anticipated the progression of neovascularization or at
least the persistence of vitreous hemorrhage without surgical
intervention in the form of laser therapy or vitrectomy. Our
experience here, and a similar case reported previously,
demonstrate that intravitreal bevacizumab can induce rapid
regression of neovascularization and resolution of vitreous
hemorrhage secondary to proliferative sickle retinopathy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
Although we are unable to state whether anti-VEGF therapy
changes the long-term history and prognosis of the disease and
incidence of future complications, intravitreal bevacizumab
injection may have a role in the primary and/or adjunct therapy
of neovascular complications of sickle cell retinopathy. Further
study on the role of anti-VEGF therapy in proliferative sickle
retinopathy is warranted.</p>
