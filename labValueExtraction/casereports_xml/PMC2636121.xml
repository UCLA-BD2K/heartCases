      <abstract>
        <p>Incidence of spinal neurocysticercosis (NCC) is rare. Isolated
spinal NCC is still rarer. We present here a case report where
a young lady presented with all the clinical features of
pseudotumor cerebri (PTC), where medical treatment for PTC
failed and the presence of cysticercous in spinal canal was
detected only on the operation table, while doing a lumbo-
peritoneal shunt (LP shunt) to save her vision. Diagnosis could be
confirmed only after the histopathology report was received. She
did not have any direct evidence of spinal involvement, thereby
eluding correct diagnosis. In English literature, we could not
find any report of isolated and silent spinal NCC associated with
PTC. In addition, we could not find any report of recovery of
cysticercous larva through the Touhey&#x2032;s needle injury, although
this was an incidental finding. In endemic areas, isolated spinal
NCC should be suspected in patients presenting with PTC.</p>

    <p>Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) is characterized by features of
raised intracranial pressure, papilledema, normal imaging of
brain and normal composition of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> Therapy of PTC is directed towards its etiology, when it is
known.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> While diffuse involvement of brain parenchyma
by neurocysticercosis (NCC) may give rise to features of
PTC, requiring LP shunt, for relief,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> isolated spinal NCC is
not known to be associated with it. We report, for the first
time, a case of PTC associated with isolated spinal NCC.
Incidentally, the cysticercous larva was also recovered
through the Touhey&#x2032;s needle injury, which is also being
reported for the first time.</p>

      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>A 35-year-old married lady was referred to us for headache
and progressive blurring of vision since 6 months. Most
of the time, her headache was accompanied by vomiting.
Her menstrual cycle was normal. Her height was 150 cm
and weight 71 kg. Her pulse was 80/min, blood pressure
140/90 mm of Hg. Her pupils were equal and reacting to
light; visual acuity was finger counting in both eyes with
secondary optic atrophy. Rest of the nervous system and
all other systems were clinically normal. Her hemogram,
biochemical parameters and thyroid profile were within
normal range. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her
brain done earlier and contrast enhanced computerized
tomographic (CT) scan of brain done on admission were
also normal. Opening pressure of CSF, during lumbar
puncture, was 300 mm of water and it was clear; CSF sugar
was 50 mg/dl, protein 32 mg/dl and cell count 1; culture was
sterile. She had received acetazolamide and advised surgery
3 months back by our ophthalmologist, which she refused at
that time. Perimetry done during her previous visit showed
inferior altitudinal and nasal field defect encroaching central
fixation in the left eye [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>] and inferior altitudinal and
nasal field defect in the right eye [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>]. With the diagnosis
of PTC with impending blindness, lumbo-peritoneal (LP)
shunt was undertaken under general anesthesia. Attempts to
put Touhey&#x2032;s needle initially at L<sub>4</sub>/L<sub>5</sub> interspace and then at
L<sub>3</sub>/L<sub>4</sub> interspace resulted in CSF coming out under pressure,
but outflow of CSF ended abruptly, for which it was decided
to put the shunt into lumbar subarachnoid space under
vision by open method. An elongated structure resembling
a torn nerve root or filum terminale [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>] came out at
the suction tip, when attempt was being made to dissect
the interspinous space. Shunt procedure was completed.
We could not ascertain the mother tissue of the 5-cm long
specimen [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>]. The specimen was sent for tissue diagnosis.
On the 8th postoperative day histopathology report revealed
the diagnosis of cysticercosis. She was given albendazole
(tablet Zentel&#xAE; 400 mg, manufactured by SmithKline Beecham
Pharmaceuticals) 400 mg twice-a-day to be taken orally
for 30 days.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> The lady was cured of headache immediately
after surgery, but her vision, at the end of 1 year, recovered
marginally to VA 10/200 in both eyes. MRI of spine done
during follow-up was normal.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Neurocysticercosis is the commonest parasitic infestation of
the central nervous system.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> Infestation of brain, spinal cord,
their meninges, subarachnoid space or eyes by the cystic form
of larva of <italic>Taenia solium</italic> is defined as NCC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> Isolated spinal
NCC is the infestation of spinal cord or its meninges by larva
of <italic>Taenia solium</italic> in the absence of intracranial involvement.
The word &#x2032;silent&#x2032; is used here to denote the absence of clinical
features of the involvement of spinal cord or nerves in the
presence of spinal NCC.</p>
      <p>Spinal cysticercosis is thought to be due to downward
migration of larvae from the cerebral to the spinal subarachnoid
spaces with possible ventriculoependymal infiltration or
hematogenous dissemination.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> Incidence of spinal NCC
is in-between 0.7 and 3% of all NCC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> But
contribution of isolated spinal NCC is only 25% in them.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> Spinal NCC
usually presents with back pain, features of neural tissue
involvement like motor weakness, sensory deficits or bladder
and bowel involvement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> It may also present with features
of arachnoiditis like hydrocephalus and findings in CSF.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> Very
small cysts in lumbar subarachnoid space can take a long
time to produce clinical symptoms due to the copious space
available there.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></p>
      <p>Definition of PTC includes features of raised intracranial
pressure, papilledema, normal imaging of brain parenchyma
with normal or small-sized ventricles and normal composition
of CSF.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></p>
      <p>Our patient did not have any sign or symptom related
to spinal location of NCC. Diagnosis was made only after
histopathology report was received on 8<sup>th</sup> day after surgery.
Since histopathological diagnosis of NCC is an absolute criteria
to diagnose the disease, no other tests were performed to confirm
it. She was prescribed a course of albendazole to treat other larva,
which might be present in the subarachnoid space, because we
could not move the patient immediately for MRI scan, which
is 500 km away from the hospital. Other immunological tests,
although helpful in diagnosis and follow-up of the disease,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
cannot localize the lesion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> We hesitated to undertake myelogram
or CT myelogram, to know the presence of cysts in spinal canal,
as lumbar puncture might damage or block the shunt system.
However, MRI scan of the spine which could be taken up after
6 months did not show any evidence of cyst. Obstruction to the
CSF flow at arachnoid villi or subarachnoid space is the usual
mechanism to give rise to PTC in patients with subarachnoid
NCC. Since the spine was scanned long after a course of
albendazole, we do not know for certain whether more cysts
were present in the spinal canal at the time of presentation.</p>
      <p>Patients suffering from NCC can develop symptoms
of PTC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> But
in such patients the cyst is usually present
intracranially, which is detected easily by CT scan or MRI scan
of the brain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> A case of hydrocephalus is reported in a patient
of isolated spinal NCC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> But CSF analysis of that patient was
abnormal prompting the author to go for MRI scan of spine
which revealed the diagnosis.</p>
      <p>But, in our case, we could not prove for sure whether the
spinal cysticercus was the cause for PTC, since it was otherwise
silent. The association of spinal NCC with features of PTC,
in our patient, prompts us to hypothesize that the presence
of silent spinal NCC could be the reason for PTC and in the
endemic area it should be looked for in patients with clinical
features of PTC.</p>
