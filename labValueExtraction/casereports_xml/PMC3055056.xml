        <p>A rare human case of gastroenteritis and eosinophilic ascites associated with gastric trichuriasis is described. The patient was a 32-yr-old woman who was working in a farm near Pohang, Korea. She complained of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Endoscopic examination found focal linear hyperemia on the mucosa of the stomach antrum, and endoscopic biopsy confirmed eosinophilic inflammation of the mucosa and submucosa of the stomach, terminal ileum, and cecum. The biopsy specimen of the stomach included a female Trichuris trichiura which was covered by many inflammatory cells on its surface. Ascites and intestinal wall thickening was found by CT scan, and Douglas pouch centesis aspirated bloody ascites which included many eosinophils. She was medicated with prednisolone and albendazole and cured. She is the first case of eosinophilic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and ascites associated with trichuriasis in the stomach.</p>
