    <p>Dear Dr. Kavic:</p>
    <p>I found the article <italic>Fatal Intestinal Ischemia After Laparoscopic Correction of Incisional Hernia</italic> by Dr. E. B. Wassenaar et al (2007:11(3):389&#x2013;393) very interesting and illuminating concerning mesenteric arterial atherosclerosis and its most severe end point. Their 47-year-old patient exhibited postlaparoscopy intestinal ischemia requiring visceral angiography and inferior mesenteric artery angioplasty (no stent despite some recoil/residual stenosis of this apparent single and vessel supply of the GI tract). Their patient, and 10 of another 14 patients in their review, did not survive.</p>
    <p>Their specific patient presented with known aorto-iliac atherosclerotic disease requiring previous iliac angioplasty. At that time, I suspect that arteriographic definition of celiac/superior mesenteric/inferior mesenteric stenosis/occlusions could have determined that their patient was at high risk for mesenteric ischemia. Perhaps this ultimately fatal outcome could have been precluded had angioplasty/stenting been performed preoperatively rather than after ischemia had occurred?</p>
    <p>Mesenteric vascular disease is a highly lethal/morbid process that many times is overlooked unless &#x201C;classic&#x201D; symptoms are present. Unfortunately, many times our patients present with much more soft/subtle signs and symptoms (intermittent dyspepsia, nonspecific weight loss, general malaise, and other things) and many times with no suspicious symptoms at all. Significant mesenteric arterial stenosis (at least 2 of 3 vessels) is now seen/found incidentally by MRA or CT angiography performed for other indications.</p>
    <p>The therapeutic conundrum is what should be done for the elective, minimally symptomatic patient? I suspect that many of us have known at least several patients who developed serious mesenteric ischemic complications whilst in the conservative follow-up phase of their mesenteric arterial disease as demonstrated by radiologic studies.</p>
    <p>There is somewhat of a divergence of opinion between some published material and what is discussed at vascular meetings regarding this problem. I do suspect that &#x201C;forewarned is forearmed.&#x201D; I would respectfully urge vigilance in the detection of significant (2 of 3 mesenteric vessel stenoses) and plea for early treatment of such PRIOR to the development of devastating visceral ischemia and its consequences.</p>
    <p>Very sincerely yours,</p>
