      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The technique of elastic suture was described by Raskin<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> in a review article on acute vascular lesions in the
upper limbs after crushing arm and forearm with the development of compartment syndrome.
This author used an elastic suture to approximate the edges of fasciotomy and prevent
bloody retraction. Leite et al.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> added
in the application of subcutaneous and superficial fascia, in order to avoid additional
suffering the edge of the skin, which could worsen the condition of the wound to this
technique. This modification improved the aesthetic appearance and location prevented
the formation of the lateral wound scars.</p>
      <p>The objective of this report is to present a new technique for closure of extensive
surgical wounds through elastic suture, using circular elastic rubber bands.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>Woman with 49 years old was admitted in Santa Casa de Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in good
general condition but with a tumor in hypogastric region with dimensions of 25x15 cm in
diameter and 12 cm high. The evolution of neoplasia was 10 years and had a bleeding
ulcer on its top. A CT scan showed that the tumor has not plagued the muscle layer or
other deep structures. Physical examination and additional imaging tests showed no signs
of metastases. A biopsy of this lesion diagnosed dermatofibrosarcoma. The tumor was
completely removed with wide lateral and deep margins, including muscle fascia, which
was macroscopically free of disease. The remaining wound area was of 20x15 cm in
diameter and 4 cm deep. The approximation of the wound edges was done by means of
elastic suture. Two thin circular rubber bands - usually used to hold bundles of cash -
were sterilized by autoclaving and sutured to the edges of the wound, 1 cm from the
wound area. Simple 2-0 nylon was used in suturing. These tapes were zigzag positioned.
This procedure was performed under local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine. After five days,
the wound edges were already very close to each other and the two rubber strips failed
to exert traction on them. With local anesthesia, they were replaced by a single
circular rubber tape, which kept the draw for the approximation of the edges. On the
20<sup>th</sup> postoperative day, the skin closure was completed and there was no
need to suture the skin. The patient was discharged on that day, with the wound closed
and showing good healing aspect. She continues to be followed on an outpatient basis
after over 14 months and is very pleased with the outcome of the treatment. No
recurrence or metastasis sarcoma were recorded.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The treatment of large accidental or surgical wounds require special care for their
resolution, which can require significant time and multiple surgical procedures,
depending on their characteristics and causes<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. The advantages found in wound closure of this report were:
technical ease of manufacture of elastic suture, reduced aggression to the body, short
hospital stay and good acceptance by the patient. There were no complications such as
infection, rejection, tissue necrosis or scar retraction, and healing showed good final
aesthetic appearance. The minimum financial cost and availability of this feature in all
hospitals are also highlighted advantages of this procedure.</p>
      <p>Alternatives to rebuild this type of wound would be great with grafts or skin flaps.
However, such operations, are more complex in their size and location, creating new
sores which, in turn, must also be treated<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. These behaviors are
accompanied by pain, increased incidence of infections, scar retraction, rejection and
failure. The realization of more complex surgical procedures requires skilled and
experienced professional in plastic surgery. Costs and hospital stay are also
high<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, the operation
presented in this report is easy to be conducted even by professionals without much
experience or special surgery, possible in any surgical centers, even smallers. This
technique has been used by the authors in other situations, such as raw areas after
withdrawal of burns, removal of Marjolin ulcer, severe soft tissue infections, various
skin tumors located on the trunk and limbs, the closure of abdominal wall after
laparostomies, all with good results.</p>
