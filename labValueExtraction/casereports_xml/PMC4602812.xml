        <p>Oncocytic cystadenoma is a benign tumor of salivary glands, histologically characterized by multicystic growth of the oncocytic epithelial lining. Crystals in different shapes and nature associate oncocytic type of salivary gland neoplasms.</p>
        <p>An 82 year-old woman with right parotideal mass had an operation of superficial parotidectomy. Histological examination revealed multiple unilocular or multilocular cystic lesions with incomplete fibrous capsule, papillary foldings, and 1 or 2 layers of oncocytic epithelium lines. The epithelium lining the cysts were positive for CK8, CK14, CK18, CK19, and negative for SMA, S-100, and p63 immunohistochemically.</p>
        <p>Cystadenomas were described as mostly multilocular and we presented a multifocal cystic neoplastic lesion lined by oncocytic type epithelial cells with intraluminal crystalloids. Multiple cysts forming morphology, incomplete fibrous capsule of most cysts and immunohistocemical findings were considered as multiple oncocytic cystadenoma with intraluminal crystalloids in the parotid gland.</p>

      <title>CASE</title>
      <p>An 82-year-old woman was presented with an enlarging lump in the right parotideal region. Medical history included arterial hypertension. On clinical examination, non-tender and softly palpated enlargement of the right parotid gland, with normal appearing overlying skin was observed. No lymphadenopathy was palpated. Radiologically, the neck showed well-circumscribed hypodense lesion measured as 1.8&#x200A;&#xD7;&#x200A;0.8&#x200A;cm and multiple microcystic lesions inside of the right parotideal gland region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). A fine-needle aspiration was performed from the lesion. The cytologic examination showed small groups of oncocytic cells, which were compatible with a benign salivary gland neoplasm. The tumor was surgically removed by superficial parotidectomy. On gross examination, the cut surfaces showed multiple cysts filled with white-colored material, measuring from 0.1 to 0.7&#x200A;cm in diameter with smooth inner walls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The specimen was fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and 5&#x200A;&#x3BC;m thick sections were stained with hematoxyline and eosin.</p>

      <p>Microscopic examination showed multiple separate cysts, dispersed throughout and surrounded by normal parotid tissue with incomplete fibrous capsule. The epithelial lining of the cysts was composed of 1 or 2 layers of columnar to cuboidal oncocytic cells. The lumen of cysts were filled with amorphous secretory material and numerous needle shape and polyhedral glassy pink crystalloids varied in size and shape. There were few papillary folds in some of the cysts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). There were not any solid growing areas, cytologic atypia, fibrosis, and lymphoid tissue. Mitoses were very rare.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Cystadenoma was described as a tumor composed of individual cystic spaces, which are variable in size, commonly multilocular and separated by limited amounts of intervening stroma. Oncocytic variant of cystadenoma was composed predominantly of oncocytes in unilayered or bilayered papillary structures without solid growth.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Crystalloids have been shown in a variety of salivary gland tumors and also reported to be found in salivary duct cysts of parotid gland and oncocytic salivary gland neoplasms.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In this case, most of cysts have incomplete fibrous capsules and some of cysts have papillary projects with thin fibrovasculary cores. Most of cysts lined by 1 or 2 layers of low columnar oncocytic epithelium. Only 1 cyst was lined explicit double layer oncocytic epithelium. Some cysts were multilocular. Histological pattern was repetitive for multiple cysts regarded as multiple cystadenoma with oncocytic feature. Thirty months after the right superficial parotidectomy, the patient has no clinical complaints and radiological evidence at the left parotid gland or other major salivary glands. Chaushu et al reported a case of multiple oncocytic cyst with crystalloids in parotid gland in a 67-year-old woman having arterial hypertension, likely the case that was presented. The multiple cystic nature of the lesion presumed that the nature of multiple oncocytic cysts with crystalloids in the parotid was a hyperplastic process without neoplastic implications.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In oncocytic cystadenoma of the parotid gland, crystals were identified intraluminally,<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> which were shown to be morphologically different from the tyrosine-rich crystalloids and collageneous crystalloids of the extracellular matrix of pleomorphic adenomas and other salivary gland tumors.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>
