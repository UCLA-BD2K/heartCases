          <p>Keratocystic odontogenic tumors are benign neoplasms of odontogenic origin with a potential for aggressive and infiltrative behavior. Many different treatments for this type of lesion have been reported. However, no common consensus has emerged to date regarding the most effective therapeutic approach.

          <p>We report a case of a 24-year-old Italian man who came to our department with maxillary sinus region swelling, pain and left nasal obstruction. A massive keratocystic odontogenic tumor involving the right maxillary sinus and causing focal erosions of the bony walls was diagnosed. The keratocystic odontogenic tumor was removed as much as possible by a transnasal approach using endoscopic sinus surgery, which produced optimal surgical and prognostic outcomes. Follow-up is reported for an 8-year period.</p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Conservative management in this case demonstrated good therapeutic efficacy with a low risk of recurrence. For injuries involving the maxillary sinus, the possibility of decompression or marsupialization by endoscopic sinus surgery should always be considered because it demonstrated the potential to lead to excellent results even after 8 years of follow-up in our patient. To our knowledge, no case report has described follow-up longer than 8 years for a maxillary sinus keratocystic odontogenic tumor treated with endoscopic sinus surgery.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Keratocystic odontogenic tumors are benign neoplasms of odontogenic origin with a potential for aggressive and infiltrative behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The odontogenic keratocyst was described for the first time by Philipsen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] in 1956. In 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) re-classified odontogenic neoformations, replacing the old definition of <italic>odontogenic keratocyst</italic> (OKC) with a new one, designated <italic>keratocystic odontogenic tumor</italic> (KCOT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The new classification is justified by the well-known features of this lesion in terms of growth, histological features and knowledge of underlying genetic mechanisms that may explain its development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>Many different treatments for this type of lesion, ranging from simple curettage to highly invasive <italic>en bloc</italic> resection, have been reported. However, no common consensus regarding the most effective therapeutic approach has emerged to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>Although several cases of odontogenic parakeratotic cysts have been reported in the literature, only a few were related to the new WHO classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition, among these cases, maxillary sinus giant KCOTs completely excised by enucleation or marsupialization via endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) have been extremely rare, and, to the best of our knowledge, only one case has been described in the literature since 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this case report, we present our experience in treating a patient with a KCOT removed by means of an ESS approach. There was no recurrence during 8 years of follow-up.</p>

      <title>Case presentation</title>
      <p>A 24-year-old Italian man came to our department complaining of a 3-month history of left maxillary sinus region swelling with left nasal obstruction and associated mild facial pain. He had a history of repeated cycles of antibiotic therapy without any symptomatic improvement.</p>
      <p>At the clinical examination, tumefaction was found to involve the body and ascending ramus of the maxillary sinus with intact overlying skin. No epistaxis, peri-orbital proptosis, cranial nerve palsies or paresthesias were evident. Fiber-optic rhinoscopy showed that the middle nasal meatus was partially occupied by a reddish mass that was not bleeding, together with strongly hyperemic surrounding mucosa. Erosion of the medial walls of the maxillary sinus could be seen. The right nasal cavity was apparently normal.A computed tomography (CT) scan of the paranasal sinuses showed irregularly dense solid tissue that entirely occupied the right maxillary sinus, with massive erosion of the anterior and posterior walls of the sinus. Inferiorly, the mass encased the dental roots of the corresponding right dental arch, and its extension into the nasal cavity created induced compression and deflection of the nasal septum. No enhancement after contrast administration was evident (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p>

      <p>To remove the mass, ESS was performed. After surgical volume reduction using radiofrequency of the inferior turbinate, the maxillary ostium was enlarged and the cystic lesion was opened and decompressed. Marsupialization was performed, and the cystic wall was also removed as much as possible.The histological examination revealed the presence of a cyst wall characterized by a few cell layers of squamous parakeratotic epithelium. In some areas, the epithelium was dehiscent with granulation tissue. Lymphocytes and plasma cells could be seen (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Such histological features were compatible with the diagnosis of KCOT.</p>

      <p>The post-operative evaluation revealed no recurrence of the disease, with steady improvement in the patient&#x2019;s clinical condition. Owing to the high tendency of KCOTs to recur, we opted for a long radiological follow-up with CT performed annually for the first 5 years and every 3 years thereafter.At the patient&#x2019;s 8-year follow-up examination, a post-operative CT scan showed no KCOT recurrence in the right maxillary sinus. Scarce pathologic tissue could be seen in the alveolar recess of the right maxillary sinus (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In 2005, the new histological classification of odontogenic tumors was introduced by the WHO, which re-classified the OKC as a benign intra-osseous neoplasia, the so-called keratocystic odontogenic tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Originating from the dental blade or its residue, this tumor represents 2% to 11% of all mandibular cysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Occurring at any age, these tumors primarily affect men, at an approximate ratio of 2:1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. They are more often located in the mandible than in the maxilla, where they are far less frequently found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Simiyu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] reported a total of 22 confirmed cases of KCOT, among which 15 (68.2%) occurred in the mandible, 6 (27.3%) occurred in the maxilla and 1 (4.5%) was in both jaws and was associated with Gorline-Goltz syndrome.</p>
      <p>With regard to symptoms, several researchers have reported that 50% to 90% of KCOTs are symptomatic at the time of diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The chief presenting symptom appears to be swelling in combination with pain, pus discharge and nasal obstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>KCOT is characterized by very aggressive local behavior with a high rate of recurrence, ranging from 3% to 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It should be noted that, because of their expansive potential, KCOTs may easily reach an enormous size and occupy the entire maxilla or the nasal fossa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Sinus infection and signs of bone erosion may also be observed. Extra-osseous occurrence of a KCOT is exceedingly rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>KCOTs may appear as small, round or ovoid, multi-lobulated lesions with well-defined margins and a radiolucent appearance on CT scans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Signs of bone erosion can often be seen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A characteristic regular, parakeratinized, stratified squamous epithelium and a well-defined basal layer of columnar or cuboidal cells are among the important histological features distinguishing KCOTs from other jaw cysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The epithelial lining may occasionally show features of epithelial dysplasia, and the potential for malignant transformation into squamous cell carcinoma, though rare, has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>In a series of 32 surgically treated KCOTs, Kuroyanagi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] observed significant expression of Ki-67 and p53 in the group with recurrences, suggesting that the evaluation of these marker proteins could help in the assessment of prognostic risks for malignant transformation and the need for eventual adjuvant treatment. KCOT recurrence rates vary enormously, from a maximum of 62% to a minimum of 0% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Recurrence may not be a consequence of the type of surgical management, but rather a reflection of the nature of the lesion itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Woolgar <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] explained that similar recurrence risk could be attributable to incomplete removal of the original cyst lining or of a new KCOT growth from small satellite cysts, or to an odontogenic epithelial residue left during surgical treatment. Moreover, the development of an unrelated KCOT in an adjacent bone region is often interpreted as a recurrence.</p>
      <p>The appropriate treatment of KCOT lesions is still debatable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Most surgeons advocate complete removal of the lesion with extension margins or meticulous curettage of the surrounding tissues as the best type of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Unfortunately, enucleation alone is associated with the highest recurrence rates (range, 17% to 56%), particularly when the cyst is removed in a piecemeal fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. To decrease the recurrence risk, various adjunctive therapies have been attempted, including peripheral ostectomy and the use of Carnoy&#x2019;s solution, cryotherapy or electrocautery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>Recently, the surgical risk, morbidity and relatively high rate of recurrence even after the use of aggressive surgical techniques have resulted in increased use of conservative treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Decompression and marsupialization are valid conservative options in the treatment of KCOTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Marsupialization was first described by Partsch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] in 1882 for the treatment of cystic lesions. This technique is based on the externalization of the cyst through the creation of a surgical window in the buccal mucosa and the cystic wall. The borders are then sutured to create an open cavity that communicates with the oral cavity. This procedure relieves pressure created by the cystic fluid, allowing reduction of the cystic space and facilitating bone apposition to the cystic walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p>
      <p>Pogrel <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] described 10 patients with KCOTs treated by marsupialization in whom the pathology resolved completely, both clinically and radiographically.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that if KCOTs exist in the maxilla, which is adjacent to the nasal cavity, the ESS via the transnasal approach should be considered suitable for marsupialization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Ohki <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] are the only authors to date, to the best of our knowledge, to report transnasal marsupialization using an ESS technique to remove the cystic wall and enlarge the maxillary ostium. They achieved excellent results with this procedure. We used the same surgical technique in our patient, who was KCOT recurrence-free at his 8-year follow-up examination. To our knowledge, no case report has described follow-up longer than 8 years for a maxillary sinus KCOT treated with ESS, confirming that conservative treatment may be an optimal alternative. Larger series with an adequate long-term follow-up period are required to definitively clarify the clinical validity of ESS for preventing recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Our case report confirms the data reported in the literature to date regarding the clinical and histological features of odontogenic parakeratotic cysts. Our conservative management of our patient demonstrated good therapeutic efficacy with a low risk of recurrence. For injuries involving the maxillary sinus, the possibility of decompression or marsupialization by ESS should always be considered and has the potential to produce excellent results even after several years of follow-up.</p>
