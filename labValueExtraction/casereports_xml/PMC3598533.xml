      <abstract>
        <p>Chondroblastoma is a rare tumor. It is usually benign; however, it can have an aggressive course before or after operative treatment, even resulting in pulmonary metastases. The foot is a rare location for chondroblastoma, and to our knowledge, chondroblastoma occurring in the navicular bone has not been reported previously in the English literature. We describe a case of navicular chondroblastoma case associated with an aneurysmal bone cyst. Treatment consisted of aggressive curettage, phenolization, and bone allograft. The patient was able to resume normal activities after treatment, and there was no recurrence of the chondroblastoma during a follow-up of 3 years.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Chondroblastoma was first identified by Jaffe and Lichtenstein in 1942
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is a rare and usually benign bone tumor, which accounts for approximately 1% of all benign bone tumors
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. There is a male preponderance, and there is a relatively higher frequency of chondroblastoma in the epiphyses of the long bones in adolescents. The two most common tumor locations are the proximal humerus and proximal tibia, with a male:female ratio of 2:1
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Generally, the foot is a rare location for chondroblastoma, and approximately 20% of foot chondroblastomas occur in the calcaneus and talus bones
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In addition, there have been a few reported cases of chondroblastoma occurring on the cuboid bones
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. To our knowledge, chondroblastoma of the navicular bone has not been reported previously in the English literature.</p>
      <p>We report a case of and successful management of a navicular chondroblastoma associated with an aneurysmal bone cyst.</p>

      <title>Case presentation</title>
      <p>A 24-year-old woman presented to the local clinic with pain in her left foot. She denied having any recent fevers, and she did not have any history of foot or ankle trauma. The rest of her medical history was not significant. The patient was initially treated conservatively with medication and rest. However, the pain gradually worsened, and began to be apparent even at rest. At this stage (about 6 months after her initial presentation), the patient was referred to our clinic for further treatment.</p>
      <p>During the physical examination, the patient reported tenderness in the region of the navicular bone in her left foot, but there was no palpable mass in this area, and the temperature of the skin over the navicular bone was normal. The patient was unable to bear weight on her left foot, and the motor function of the foot was difficult to assess because of the pain.</p>
      <p>Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the left foot were taken, which showed an expansile lesion of the navicular bone without periosteal reaction (Figure&#xA0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A,B). Computed tomography showed thinning of the cortex, but the talonavicular joint was normal (Figure&#xA0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A,B). A technetium-99 m bone scan was also performed, which showed increased uptake of the tracer isolated to the left navicular. Based on the imaging data, the differential diagnosis included giant-cell tumor, aneurysmal bone cyst, and chondroblastoma.</p>

      <p>A biopsy was taken from the lesion. An 18-gauge needle was used to puncture the lesion, and blood was aspirated easily from the lesion. Baseline chest radiography was also performed at this point. The result is that the blood in the lesion. Our result also based on these results).</p>
      <p>The patient was scheduled to undergo surgery including curettage, phenolization, and allograft, 3 days after her initial presentation to us. An incision 50&#x2009;mm in length was made over the left medial navicular bone, and dissection of the tissue under the periosteum was performed. The upper cortex layer of the navicular bone was easily penetrated with a curette. The endpoint of the anterior tibial tendon was well protected (Figure&#xA0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). The lesion was filled with red membranous tissue and blood. The navicular bone was curetted, and the tumor specimen was immediately sent for examination of frozen sections. The preliminary findings confirmed a benign tumor, consistent with either an aneurysmal bone cyst or chondroblastoma.</p>

      <p>A high-speed burr was then used to remove the entire lesion. This was followed by application of 89% phenol for 30 seconds, followed by neutralization with 100% alcohol for 1 minute, and then thorough irrigation with 1 litre of saline. Following the phenolization procedure, the allograft was placed into the cavity within the navicular bone (Figure&#xA0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). Two 1.5&#x2009;mm Kirschner wires were used to fix the cortex of the bone, and intraoperative fluoroscopy was performed to confirm the fixation (Figure&#xA0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A-B). A leg plaster was used to immobilize the leg.</p>

      <p>The tissue removed during surgery was sent for histological examination, and the final pathology diagnosis was navicular chondroblastoma associated with aneurysmal bone cyst. The tissue contained large polygonal chondroblast-like cells (Figure&#xA0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A) and pink cartilage-like matrix (Figure&#xA0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B), and large osteoclast-like giant cells were present in the lesion area (Figure&#xA0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C). There were also cystic lesions filled with blood, consistent with an aneurysmal bone cyst (Figure&#xA0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D). Some of the chondroblast-like cells in the cytoplasm and nucleus were positive for S-100 histology (Figure&#xA0;

      <p>The patient returned to her usual daily activities without pain. She had full range of motion of the mid-tarsal joints.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Chondroblastoma is a rare lesion. The majority (70%) of cases occur in the long bones, including the proximal humerus, proximal tibia. and femur
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The small bones are involved in only 10% of cases
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In this paper, we present a case of navicular chondroblastoma associated with an aneurysmal bone cyst. The successful treatment consisted of aggressive curettage, phenolization, and allograft reconstruction.</p>
      <p>Pain was the main and presenting symptom in our case, which is compatible with previous reports
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Because of the frequent occurrence of this tumor near joints, effusion can be present in some patients. For this reason, chondroblastoma is often misdiagnosed as an inflammatory joint disease. Atalar <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] reported a patient who had initially been misdiagnosed with a juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and had undergone anti-inflammatory therapy for 1 year before the correct diagnosis was made. In our case, there was a six-month interval from the initial symptoms of pain to the suspicion of chondroblastoma, supporting the opinion that chondroblastoma is easily misdiagnosed
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>In terms of the differential diagnosis, chondroblastoma should be distinguished from a number of other conditions. Giant-cell tumor is one possibility, but the tissue margins of chondroblastoma tend to be more clearly visible on imaging.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] Chondroma, central chondrosarcoma and clear-cell chondrosarcoma can resemble chondroblastoma
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Similar to chondroblastoma, clear-cell chondrosarcoma often involves the ends of the long bones; however, it tends to occur in middle-aged patients, whereas chondroblastoma tends to occur in young patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Epiphyseal enchondroma has many points in common with chondroblastoma in terms of patient age and the skeletal distribution and location of the tumor
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; however, histological examination can be used to distinguish between them
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. 4) Inflammatory joint disease is another possibility
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Pain was the presenting symptom, Due to its more frequent occurrence near joints, chondroblastoma can present with joint pain and effusion. For this reason, it can be misdiagnosed as inflammatory joint disease.</p>
      <p>Conventional radiographs can be helpful as an initial survey of a painful region. The involvement of the tarsal bones with cortical expansion and related erosive changes in the cortex is an indication of chondroblastoma. Usually, the lesion is located in secondary ossification centers
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Altalar <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] reported that calcification in chondroblastoma was visible on radiographs in 59.4% of cases. A baseline chest radiograph should be obtained before diagnosis or surgery, and the diagnosis should be confirmed by biopsy. Annual chest radiographs should be performed for 5 years after treatment to monitor for pulmonary metastasis, which occurs in 1 to 3% of patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We should emphasize that the chondroblastoma might already display aggressive behavior at an early stage
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A bone scan may also be helpful to exclude other areas of skeletal involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful to identify whether a soft-tissue mass is present.</p>
      <p>Chondroblastoma is typically a slow-growing tumor
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Rarely, the tumor can grow rapidly, destroying the cortex and invading the soft tissues. However, Altalar <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] reported that cortical destruction and soft-tissue invasion were seen in 13/32 patients with chondroblastoma. Our patient had no evidence of soft-tissue invasion. Secondary aneurysmal bone cysts have been reported by other authors
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and this was also seen in our patient.</p>
      <p>Atalar <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] reported that local recurrence of chondroblastoma occurred in about 21.4% of their patients during the long-term follow-up. This recurrence rate is consistent with those in other studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Suneja <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] reported that invasion of an open growth plate (physis) might imply the increase risk for local recurrence. However, Atalar <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] analyzed potential risk factors for recurrence in 28 patients, and did not find that young age or the presence of an open physis to be associated with local recurrence. Nevertheless, controversy exists about what risk factors are associated with recurrence. The risk of recurrence has been reported as being higher in the hip and the pelvis, as a result of the difficult surgical access
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], but Suneja <italic>et al</italic>. and Atalar <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] reported that there was no association between tumor location and recurrence. Generally, recurrence of chondroblastoma doe not seem to be associated with age, sex, tumor location, growth-plate status, or tumor activity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>In previous reports, it was suggested that surgical techniques can play a crucial role in chondroblastoma recurrence, as the actual removal of the tumor seems to be an important factor
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Simple curettage seems to result in a relatively higher recurrence rate compared with a standard curettage procedure
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A combination of curettage and cryosurgery was recommended by Schreuder <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which they reported as contributing to reducing the likelihood of recurrence. Lin <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] reported that use of a burr could aid in extending the curettage, particularly in areas that are difficult to access. Atalar <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] recommended cautery as a powerful tool in areas that were difficult to reach areas, as the heat generated could kill the tumor cells. A number of other surgical techniques are also available, including open and endoscopic curettage, curettage with fat implantation, marginal resection, resection with radiofrequency ablation, and osteochondral autograft transfer
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p>
      <p>How to reconstruct the bone defect after surgery is another issue. Use of cement, bone graft, and other alternatives has been reported previously
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Sessions <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] reported successful reconstruction using cement in cases of cuboid tumor. Reconstruction with cement can make immediate weight-bearing possible without risk of fracture, and can improve radiographic follow-up. However, the bone graft may resorb, making it difficult to differentiate the graft from a tumor recurrence
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The long-term effect of cement on the articular surface of the bone remains unknown, but it is possible that arthritis may develop, due to the non-anatomical construction of the cement
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. At present, biological reconstruction using bone graft seems to be the best option, with good results reported by a number of authors
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The most common option for reconstruction after tumor excision is bone autograft harvested from iliac crest or fibula. The advantages of autograft include improved rate of graft incorporation and lack of immunogenic concerns
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]; however, it may need a longer operating time and can result in donor morbidity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Use of allografot is an alternative option, which has been used for treatment of tumors in the calcaneus and talus bones
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, fracture and non-union are common complications for allografts. There is also a risk of transmitting disease with allograft; however, with safety precautions, including donor selection and biological investigations, such risks are low
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the present case, there were no complications related to the allograft.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Generally, it is well accepted that aggressive curettage and bone graft are the preferred treatment for chondroblastoma
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In our case, our successful treatment consisted of an open biopsy followed by curettage, phenolization, and allograft. This case appears to be the first case of chondroblastoma occurring in the navicular bone. We hope this report will increase the awareness of this rare tumor occurring in the foot.</p>
