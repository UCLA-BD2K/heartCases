        <p>Ventricular constraint therapy has been used to prevent and reverse the
progression of heart failure in ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathies. We
hypothesized that ventricular restraint should be tried by closing the
pericardium that was previously opened following left ventricle topographical
projection. The surgical technique presentation is illustrated by a remarkable
13-year outcome of one patient with dilated cardiomyopathy treated surgically by
mitral prosthesis, Cox/Maze III surgery to treat atrial fibrillation, and
associated to the ventricular constraint using the patient's own pericardium.
The ventricular pericardial restraint role is unclear, since the patient had
multiple corrections that could be responsible for the good outcome; however it
is viable deserving investigations.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Dilated cardiomyopathy (DC) is one of the most serious cardiovascular diseases,
leading to sustained and increased morbidity rates. It is a public health issue
associated with poor outcomes in the adult population and has become the leading
cause of death in adults<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p>
      <p>The incidence of heart failure (HF) in the United States has been increasing, with
825,000 new cases in 2013. Despite medical and surgical advances, 50% of patients
diagnosed with HF die within five years<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. This syndrome has many idiopathic causes as well as
recognized etiologies, among which the most common is coronary artery disease. Other
etiologies include tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, storage disorders, and
metabolic disorders, viral and postpartum. As a consequence, the increased volume of
the left ventricle (LV) causes wall stress and high energy expenditure, triggering a
mechanism of positive feedback that leads to progressive cardiac remodeling, marked
cardiomegaly, spherical LV deformation, and mitral valve insufficiency
(MVI)<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p>
      <p>Although heart transplantation is still the gold standard of treatment for DC, most
patients, such as those who are older adult patients and those with comorbidities or
socioeconomic limitations, are excluded. In addition to neurohormonal blockade
(developed in the latter years of the 20<sup>th</sup> century), selected patients
with advanced HF have several alternatives treatments, such as cardiac
resynchronization therapy or left ventricular assist devices, as well as surgical
procedures, including mitral valve (MV) surgery (valve replacement or repair) and
partial left ventriculectomy. These treatments should be considered as alternatives
or bridge therapies to orthotropic heart transplantation.</p>
      <p>Ventricular constraint therapy has been used to prevent or reverse the progression of
HF in ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies. Two devices have been used
clinically: a polyester multifilament mesh (CorCap Cardiac Support Device, Acorn,
St. Paul, MN, USA) and a nitinol mesh for ventricular wrapping (HeartNet device,
Paracor Medical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. We hypothesized that ventricular restraint should
be tried by closing the pericardium that was previously opened following LV
topographical projection.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>CASE ILLUSTRATION</title>
      <p>A 54-year-old male patient was attended for the first time in 2002 for a history of
progressive dyspnea that had progressed to resting dyspnea (NYHA class IV). Physical
examination revealed cardiac atrial fibrillation (AF), heart rate 160 bpm, jugular
stasis, and a palpable liver situated at 3-4 cm from the right costal margin. He had
a history of rheumatic heart disease, alcoholism, and smoking. An initial
echocardiogram revealed the presence of mild deficiencies of the mitral and
tricuspid valves associated with dilation of the heart chamber and an ejection
fraction (EF) of 20%.</p>
      <p>During 18 months of nutritional and pharmacologically optimized treatment (consisting
of the neurohormonal blockade, diuretics, digitalis and anticoagulant), the patient
remained in the advanced stage of HF. This clinical situation was consistently
associated with echocardiographic findings that were incompatible with the severity
of his clinical status. Based on these indicators, we diagnosed the patient with
dilated cardiomyopathy associated with severe HF, possibly indicating heart
transplantation. The personal circumstances and difficulties inherent in transplant
surgery, MV replacement, and treatment of AF were discussed. On that occasion, it
was proposed that external ventricular constraint related to these procedures (using
the Acorn CorCap device) could confer additional benefits. After extensive
discussion with the heart team and the patient, it was decided to test the
feasibility of external ventricular restriction using the patient's own pericardium.
After obtaining the consent of the patient to this trial, we proceeded with the
surgical treatment.</p>
      <p>The surgical findings included the following: 1) atrial fibrillation (AF) rhythm; 2)
great cardiomegaly at the expense mainly of the left atrium (LA) and LV; 3) cardiac
index (CI) = 1.3; 4) mitral valve (MV) calcified and fibrotic at the edges with some
shortening or lengthening chordal; and 5) a great left atrial appendage without
thrombi. Under cardiopulmonary bypass and myocardial protection with blood
cardioplegia, surgery was performed in four steps:</p>
      <list list-type="order">
        <list-item>
          <p>Pericardiotomy following the topography of the heart - Preserving pleural
integrity, we proceeded to perform a vertical pericardiotomy down to the
level of the atrioventricular groove, diverting the incision obliquely
toward the apex of the LV, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure
1A</xref> (projection of the incision) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref> (pericardiotomy).</p>

</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>MV replacement - We used a biological MV prosthesis consisting of bovine
pericardium (Braile-M29) and preserved the valve apparatus by performing a
resection of the anterior leaflet in a lunate shape, between the edge where
the chordae were inserted and the anterior annulus. We implanted the
prosthesis using 13 wires of Mersilene 2-0-anchored Teflon; the anterior
leaflet points were passed at the free edge of the leaflet and the ring
remained.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Cox/Maze III surgery for the treatment of AF - The third step comprised
disconnecting and suturing the pulmonary veins; resecting and suturing the
left atrial appendages, and making atrial incisions and sutures. After
aortic clamp release, ventricular fibrillation reverted to sinus rhythm by
way of internal defibrillation. The patient was discontinued from
cardiopulmonary bypass with CI = 2.4, sinus rhythm, with 10 mcg/kg/min of
dobutamine, withdrawal of cannulas, wire pacemaker in right atrium and right
ventricle, and hemostasis.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Restraint of the ventricles- With the aid of the pericardium flaps, adjusted
snugly by the surgeon at the end diastole, the surgeon narrowed the suture
from the LV apex to the atrioventricular groove, referring to hemodynamic
monitoring and completing the superior longitudinal pericardium incision
without atrial constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>
and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">1D</xref>). After this maneuver, the
ventricles were constrained in a position where there was no hypotension or
CI decrease. A suction drain was inserted into the pericardial sac.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>During the first two years after surgery, the patient's clinical outcome was
associated with highly positive echocardiographic data that were consistently
observed until the recurrence of AF. Even then, the patient's clinical course
remained well-controlled (NYHA class II). In the eighth year after surgery, however,
echocardiographic evidence began to show degeneration of the mitral prosthesis. The
patient's last hospitalization resulted from severe gastrointestinal bleeding caused
by the gastroduodenal artery and required blood transfusions. During
hospitalization, the patient developed severe HF, and echocardiography showed marked
degeneration with stenosis of the mitral prosthesis. This prosthesis was replaced by
another bovine pericardial valve that was implanted via a transatrial approach,
keeping the restrictive pericardium sac. The surgery and the early and four-month
postoperative outcomes were uneventful. The echocardiogram timeline data is
presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The first part of this discussion briefly mentions the two well-known surgical
approaches to treat HF that surely had capitol importance for the remarkable patient
outcome: 1) The mitral prosthesis preserving the valve apparatus, and 2) The
Cox/Maze III surgery to treat atrial fibrillation.</p>
      <p>In 1984, a group at Harvard University postulated that the correction of MVI would
increase systolic volume regardless of left ventricular EF. This concept became the
impetus for using MV surgery as an adjunct HF treatment. This group's hypothesis was
based on possible systolic volume increase, LV volume overload and end-diastolic
pressure decrease<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.
Bolling et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>,
from the University of Michigan, proposed a technique for mitral annulus reduction
using undersized rings in the repair of MVI. Their aim was to obtain the additive
effect of reshaping the LV to facilitate the return of ventricular ellipsoidal
conformation. In other studies, optimal functional improvement after partial
ventriculectomy (the Batista operation) has been considered when mitral
regurgitation is corrected simultaneously, thereby reinforcing this
concept<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p>
      <p>The Cox/Maze III surgical procedure remains the treatment with the highest cure rates
(over 90%), but the challenging technical nature of the traditional cut-and-sew
technique has limited its mainstream uptake<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p>
      <p>Because of the enduring belief in its salutary effects on HF patients, strategies for
achieving surgical ventricular restoration using fewer invasive methods continue to
be pursued. A number of devices designed to restore LV geometry and decrease wall
stress have been tested in both ischemic and nonischemic HF patients. Of all the
devices developed to date, the most tested has been the CorCap Cardiac Support
Device. The CorCap device consists of a polyester mesh that is placed
circumferentially around the heart, from the apex to the atrioventricular groove. It
provides diastolic resistance to filling by being adjusted snugly by the surgeon at
the end diastole. In addition, it provides circumferential support, decreases LV
wall stress, and resists progressive chamber dilation without any systolic
assistance<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. After impressive results in sheep models of ischemic
cardiomyopathy, in which CorCap reduced left ventricular end-diastolic volume
(LVEDV) by 39% and increased EF by 90%, phase 2 studies confirmed its safety and
feasibility in human subjects. Subsequently, results from 300 HF patients in the
Acorn Pivotal Trial were published, comparing CorCap with mitral surgery
<italic>versus</italic> mitral surgery alone, and CorCap plus medical therapy
<italic>versus</italic> medical therapy alone. In this trial, 148 patients were
treated with CorCap. However, despite needing fewer subsequent procedures, having
improved NYHA class and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLHF) score and
favorable echocardiographic reverse remodeling, patients did not demonstrate
improvement in survival at 1, 3, or 5 years<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p>
      <p>Mortality rates remain significant in patients waiting for heart transplantation,
perhaps because treatment alternatives for HF are still part of an open research
field<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. In planning the surgery,
the above discussion took into account the hypothesized benefits of using an
<italic>in situ</italic> patient pericardium to constrain the LV. Although the
degree to which the <italic>in situ</italic> ventricular and pericardial restraint
contributed to the patient's good outcome is unclear, since the patient had multiple
corrections that could be responsible for the good result, however its presentation
as a viable technique is pertinent to further investigations.</p>
