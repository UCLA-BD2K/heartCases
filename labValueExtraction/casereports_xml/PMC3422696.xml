      <abstract>
        <p>Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus, or porokeratotic eccrine nevus (PEN), is a hyperkeratotic epidermal nevus. Several cases of widespread involvement have been reported, including one in association with the keratitis&#x2013;ichthyosis&#x2013;deafness (KID) syndrome (OMIM #148210), a rare disorder caused by mutations in the <italic>GJB2</italic> gene coding for the gap junction protein connexin26 (Cx26). The molecular cause is, as yet, unknown. We have noted that PEN histopathology is shared by KID. The clinical appearance of PEN can resemble that of KID syndrome. Furthermore, a recent report of cutaneous mosaicism for a <italic>GJB2</italic> mutation associated with KID describes linear hyperkeratotic skin lesions that might be consistent with PEN. From this, we hypothesized that PEN might be caused by Cx26 mutations associated with KID or similar gap junction disorders. Thus, we analyzed the <italic>GJB2</italic> gene in skin samples from two patients referred with generalized PEN. In both, we found <italic>GJB2</italic> mutations in the PEN lesions but not in unaffected skin or peripheral blood. One mutation was already known to cause the KID syndrome, and the other had not been previously associated with skin symptoms. We provide extensive functional data to support its pathogenicity. We conclude that PEN may be caused by mosaic <italic>GJB2</italic> mutations.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The term &#x201C;porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus&#x201D; was first used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abell and Read (1980</xref>) to describe a hard, verrucous epidermal nevus. Histopathological features typically include ortho- or parakeratotic plugs protruding from dilated (eccrine) ducts and follicular openings. Depending on sectioning, these plugs can appear as so-called cornoid lamellae. In addition, hyper(para)keratosis and wavy psoriasiform epidermal acanthosis can also be present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aloi and Pippione, 1986</xref>). Comedo-like or spiky lesions can be prominent in porokeratotic eccrine nevus (PEN) when located on the palms or soles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sassmannshausen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Several cases of bilaterally systematized lesions of PEN affecting large areas of the body have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cobb <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kroumpouzos <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cambiaghi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goddard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Happle and Rogers (2002)</xref> recently proposed the more compact designation &#x201C;PEN&#x201D;.</p>
      <p>The molecular cause is, as yet, still unknown. However, we have noted that the characteristic cutaneous histopathology is shared by the keratitis&#x2013;ichthyosis&#x2013;deafness (KID) syndrome (OMIM #148210). This rare disorder is caused by mutations in the <italic>GJB2</italic> gene coding for the gap junction protein connexin26 (Cx26; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">van Steensel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). KID syndrome histopathology typically shows dilated follicular and eccrine duct openings with a preserved granular layer and ortho-/parakeratotic plugs that can appear as cornoid lamellae. The epidermis shows wavy psoriasiform acanthosis. Clinically, the ichthyosis in KID is characterized by generalized figurate erythema and cobblestone-like or spiky hyperkeratosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Zwart-Storm <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Thus, KID syndrome can appear as a generalized form of PEN. Two of the authors (PS and RH) have personally seen a newborn with lethal KID syndrome born to a women diagnosed with PEN. They initially diagnosed the child with &#x201C;generalized PEN&#x201D;, which was later revised (Steijlen P, personal communication). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Titeux <italic>et al.</italic> (2009</xref>) recently described mosaicism for a Cx26 mutation causing the previously reported substitution p.Asp50Asn (D50N) in the mother of a child with KID syndrome. The mother had a short stature and bilateral linear hyperkeratotic skin lesions on the trunk. Unfortunately, the photographs provided in that report were of insufficient quality to confidently make a diagnosis, but the abnormalities might be consistent with PEN. Finally, cases of nonsegmental KID syndrome were recently reported to be &#x201C;associated with PEN&#x201D;, on the grounds of purely histopathological findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Criscione <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lazic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Considering the above, we hypothesized that PEN might be caused by Cx26 mutations associated with KID syndrome or similar hyperkeratotic gap junction disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Zwart-Storm <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Thus, we analyzed the <italic>GJB2</italic> gene in skin and blood samples from two patients who were referred with widespread PEN, confirmed by histopathological examination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Both patients were otherwise healthy and had no other symptoms besides skin lesions.</p>

        <title>Case reports</title>
        <p>Clinical examination of patient 1, from Italy, showed widespread spiky hyperkeratotic papules and plaques with linear distribution on the extremities, and mostly diffuse palmoplantar involvement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a&#x2013;c</xref>). The nails of both hands and the left foot were dystrophic. The abnormalities had been present since birth and were not progressive. There were no mucosal abnormalities. Hair and teeth were normal. There was no hearing loss, and family history was negative. Several biopsies were taken from affected sites and sent for histopathological examination. All showed abnormalities that were deemed consistent with PEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i&#x2013;j</xref>). Patient 2, from the Netherlands, had less widespread involvement, presenting with linear spiky hyperkeratotic plaques on both feet and geographic brown-red plaques with a sharply demarcated border in a linear distribution on the trunk and proximal extremities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d&#x2013;f</xref>). The skin lesions had been present all his life and were not progressive. Hearing loss was not present. Family history was negative. A biopsy taken from the trunk showed similar abnormalities to those in patient 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k and l</xref>). Both patients were diagnosed as having PEN.</p>

        <title>Mutation analysis indicates somatic mosaicism</title>
        <p>In both patients, we detected mutations within the <italic>GJB2</italic> gene in samples from all biopsied disease sites. Specifically, three sites were sampled in patient 1 (foot sole, knee, and trunk) and two sites in patient 2 (axilla and trunk). We could only amplify wild-type (WT) <italic>GJB2</italic> from unaffected skin (one sample per patient, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>) and peripheral blood leukocytes (not shown). Patient 1 had a transition c.40A&gt;T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) causing the known KID-associated amino acid change p.Asn14Tyr (N14Y, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>); patient 2 had a transversion c.279G&gt;A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) causing the substitution p.Met93Ile (M93I). We also sequenced the <italic>GJB6</italic> gene, as there are reports suggesting that mutations in <italic>GJB6</italic> can cause disorders resembling those associated with <italic>GJB2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). No <italic>GJB6</italic> mutations were found in either patients. Although N14Y is known to be pathogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Zwart-Storm <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), M93I has not previously been reported in conjunction with cutaneous abnormalities.</p>
        <p>We performed additional investigations to determine whether M93I is a pathogenic change.</p>

        <title>Affected skin shows hyperproliferation and altered Cx26 expression patterns</title>
        <p>Skin biopsies from the two patients were stained for Cx26 plus a number of cell proliferation/differentiation markers and compared with normal skin tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In both normal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) and N14Y patient tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), Cx26 was observed in the cornified layer as well as within the spinous and granular layers. The pattern in normal skin is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Richard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Within the M93I patient tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), however, Cx26 expression was only observed within the spinous and granular layers and not in the cornified layer. In control skin, Cx26 staining has a dense punctate distribution, at points of cell-to-cell contact. Biopsies from the patient harboring the N14Y mutation, in contrast, displayed a more dispersed punctate pattern of staining. Interestingly, M93I expression is intermediate, the staining being accentuated in certain membrane localizations. Expression of cytokeratin10 (CK10), an early differentiation marker, was greatly increased in both N14Y and M93I patient tissues in comparison with normal tissue, as was loricrin expression (a marker of terminal differentiation). To determine whether the N14Y and M93I mutations resulted in an increase in cellular proliferation, tissues were stained with Ki67. In addition, tissues were co-stained with the basal cell marker CK14. Ki67+ cells were present within the basal layer of normal and patient tissue; however, the percentage of Ki67+/CK14+ cells was increased in both patient tissue samples. In normal tissue, 19.1% (&#xB1;1.87% SEM) cells had double-positive staining, whereas patient 1 had 25.7% (&#xB1;6.3% SEM) and patient 2 had 26.5% (&#xB1;5.8% SEM). These differences were not found to be statistically significant.</p>

        <title>M93I-GFP traffics to the cell membrane and forms large gap junction plaques</title>
        <p>HeLa Ohio cells (which do not express endogenous connexins) were transfected with Cx26WT-mCherry alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), M93I-GFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), or both Cx26WT-mCherry and M93I-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). As with Cx26WT-mCherry expression, M93I-GFP was observed both at the plasma membrane and within the cytoplasm as intracellular stores. Co-transfection of Cx26WT-mCherry with M93I-GFP showed clear co-localization. From this, we concluded that the M93I mutation does not disrupt interaction with Cx26WT. In addition, M93I-GFP formed large gap junction plaques at points of cell-to-cell contact, highly separated from intracellular regions as denoted by co-staining with the endoplasmic reticulum&#x2013;Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) marker p58 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). We can conclude from this that the M93I mutation has no adverse effect on trafficking, unlike the D66H mutation, which remains trapped in intracellular areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).</p>

        <title>Junctional functionality measured by dye transfer is not affected by the M93I mutation</title>
        <p>As aberrant connexin signaling is associated with a range of Cx26-related disorders, we assessed the ability of M93I-GFP to form functional gap junctions and hemichannels. A variety of assays are widely used to determine gap junction coupling efficiency. These include microinjection analysis, in which coupling efficiency is determined by the extent of transfer of small fluorescent dyes of differing charge and mass (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Easton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), and parachute assays, which determine the transfer of the fluorescent probe calcein AM (molecular weight=623&#x2009;Da, charge &#x2212;4). The latter have been widely used by ourselves and others in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ziambaras <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D&#xFC;rig <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rudkin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In the present work, we performed parachute assays between HeLa Ohio cells transfected with the different complementary DNA constructs and HeLa26 cells that stably express Cx26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). In this case, it is evident that both untransfected HeLa Ohio cells and those transfected to express D66H-GFP were unable to form functional gap junction channels, as can be seen by the restricted spread of calcein to adjoining cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). By contrast, cells transfected with either Cx26WT-GFP or M93I-GFP were able to transfer dye to HeLa26 cells, illustrating formation of functional gap junction channels by the M93I mutations. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groupings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). We can be certain that the observed dye transfer is due to channel formation between the transfected HeLa Ohio cells and the HeLa26 cells, because both non-transfected HeLa Ohio cells and those transfected with D66H-GFP (associated with Vohwinkel's syndrome and known to be nonfunctional) showed no transfer.</p>
        <p>In addition to the ability to form functional gap junctions, we investigated the effect of M93I-GFP expression on hemichannel signaling. Exposing connexins to zero calcium conditions is a robust method to induce hemichannel openings that can be monitored by ATP release and subsequently blocked by a range of connexin hemichannel blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leybaert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). In HeLa Ohio cells transfected to express a control vector (GFP) or the Cx26 mutation D66H-GFP, no ATP release was detected following the calcium switch. By contrast, in cells transfected with Cx26WT-GFP or M93I-GFP, a significant release in ATP was observed, which was blocked upon co-incubation with the hemichannel blocker carbenoxolone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Measured ATP release was lower in M93I-GFP-expressing cells than was observed for those expressing Cx26WT-GFP, although this was not statistically significant.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>On the basis of our experimental findings, we suggest that PEN can be associated with somatic mutations in <italic>GJB2</italic> coding for the gap junction protein Cx26. We found two distinct amino acid substitutions in two unrelated patients. One mutation, N14Y, is a known pathogenic change that has been reported in conjunction with disorders resembling the KID syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Zwart-Storm <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The second mutation, M93I, has been previously reported in <italic>trans</italic> with the deafness-associated truncating mutation c.del35G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). It is not clear from that report whether or not that particular patient had skin symptoms. If not, the change may not have been pathogenic to the skin, or may have caused only very mild symptoms that were missed. Another, more intriguing, explanation might be that mutations in Cx26 associated with skin disease only cause symptoms in <italic>trans</italic> with a WT allele. The latter hypothesis would be consistent with the observation that mutations in Cx26 causing cutaneous symptoms are dominant. Previous observations of <italic>trans</italic>-dominant effects from mutant Cx26 on Cx43 also support this idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rouan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). It will be interesting to pursue this notion in future research. Our finding of the mutation in affected skin only and not in unaffected areas or peripheral blood further argues in favor of its pathogenicity. To provide more pertinent proof, we conducted additional studies. Our experiments illustrate that M93I maintains many of the functional parameters of Cx26WT as measured by our assays. Unlike mutations associated with conditions such as Vohwinkel's syndrome, where the protein is restricted to intracellular locations and does not form hemichannels or gap junctions in homotypic conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakirtzis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Marziano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), M93I targets to the cell membrane and forms both hemichannels and gap junctions. Our parachute assays demonstrate that M93I is able to form functional channels, in contrast to D66H. On the basis of calcein dye transfer, gap junctions composed of M93I have functional properties similar to Cx26WT, although it is possible that permeability to other dyes might be altered. We have previously demonstrated that alterations in the size of the dye do not correlate with disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Zwart-Storm <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and therefore decided not to pursue this particular property of gap junctions. The zero calcium switch experiment clearly illustrates that M93I retains the ability to form hemichannels. Aberrant or enhanced hemichannel activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of KID syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Compared with Cx26WT, we find that, for M93I, ATP release upon zero calcium switching is marginally reduced. From this, we tentatively conclude that hemichannel behavior might be affected by mutation M93I, and other assays including electrophysiology comparisons may elucidate these changes further in the future. Importantly, immunofluorescence analysis of CK10 and Ki67 expression in affected skin from both patients clearly indicates increased keratinocyte proliferation, which is consistent with earlier reports describing epidermal hyperproliferation due to Cx26 mutations. The increased loricrin staining supports this interpretation. We also see altered spatial localization of Cx26 in patient samples (the antibody does not distinguish mutant from WT), and this may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disorder. It is noteworthy that the expression of both mutant forms is reduced, and M93I is no longer found in the stratum corneum as opposed to N14Y and WT. These differences between patients and controls likely cannot be ascribed to the biopsy site, as there are no significant regional variations in cutaneous Cx26 expression (Richard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002).</p>
      <p>At present, we do not know what consequences the altered epidermal Cx26 expression patterns have for skin function. However, our observations would suggest that loss of function resulting from reduced Cx26 levels might contribute to epidermal hyperproliferation. We note that M93I seems to still form gap junction plaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), in contrast to N14Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), which shows a more diffuse distribution consistent with lack of gap junction formation.</p>
      <p>From the above data, we conclude that M93I is likely a pathogenic change, but expression of M93I does not impact Cx26 function as severely as N14Y expression, as measured by our assays. This might be reflected in the clinical presentation. Whereas the Italian patient had the hyperkeratotic skin changes typically observed in KID syndrome, the Dutch patient had altogether less pronounced lesions. It is conceivable that the less pronounced phenotype correlates with the milder impact of M93I on Cx26 function. The clinical differences are reflected in the histopathology, which shows much milder abnormalities in the Dutch patient.</p>
      <p>From our findings, we conclude that PEN could be caused by different somatic Cx26 mutations. There may be a genotype&#x2013;phenotype correlation, and it will be of considerable interest to determine the causative mutation in further cases of PEN. Our findings also illustrate that our assays for Cx26 function do not always predict whether or not a mutation is pathogenic, raising questions as to the mechanism by which mutations in Cx26 cause disease and underscoring the need for analysis of patient material.</p>

In addition, tissue was co-stained with Ki67 (red) and CK14 (green) to identify proliferating cells in the basal layer. Nuclei stained with 4&#x2032;-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Patient skin shows a clear increase in CK10 and loricrin staining plus an increase in Ki67-positive cells in the basal layer. Interestingly, no Cx26 staining was observed in the stratum corneum of patient 2. For both patients, overall Cx26 staining seems to be less intense than that of wild type (<bold>a</bold>). In addition, patient 2 (M93I) shows plaque formation, in contrast to patient 1 (N14Y). For orientation purposes, the basal layer is indicated by a dotted white line. Bar=30&#x2009;&#x3BC;m.</p>

Cx26WT-mCherry and M93I-GFP co-localized throughout the cell (yellow) and formed visible gap junction plaques at points of cell-to-cell contact.
