      <abstract>
        <p>Congenital anomalies of the lens include a wide range from lens
coloboma to primary aphakia and doubling of lens. There have
been few case reports of double lens; the etiology suggested
is metaplastic changes in the surface ectoderm that leads to
formation of two lens vesicles and hence resulting in double lens.
We report a case with bilobed lens, which raises the possibility of
explaining the etiology of double lens.</p>

    <p>Congenital coloboma of the lens is the most common congenital
anomaly of lens. In the region of the coloboma, there is usually
some defect in the zonules and hence the resultant coloboma.
Cases with duplicated lens that is a single eye carrying two
lenses, have been described. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> The exact mechanism for this
anomaly is not known yet. Our case serves to explain the
connection between lens coloboma and duplicated lens.</p>

      <title>Case History</title>
      <p>A young boy, 16 years old, presented with complaints of poor
vision in the left eye since childhood. There was no history of
any treatment or surgical intervention. In addition, no history
pertaining to any trauma was given. Birth history was not
significant. On examination, he had a vision of 20/200 in the
right eye (RE) and 20/20 in the left eye (LE). The LE was clinically
normal with a normal fundus. The RE revealed a horizontally
placed bilobed lens sharing a common capsular bag. Zonules
were lacking around the fissure between the two lobes [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>].
Also, there was an inferior iris coloboma. Fundus was normal
in both eyes. An ultrasonogram of the right eye [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>] revealed
a bilobed lens in the anterior segment of the eye with normal
posterior segment.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Congenital anomalies of the lens are varied. Partial congenital
aphakia is a rare condition in which the lens appears to be
partially divided by a deep furrow.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></p>
      <p>In the case of congenital duplication of lens reported by
Thakkar <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> two lenses were placed obliquely in a straight line
with a clear area in between. Absence of zonules and capsule
between the two lenses was also noted. Richardson<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> reported
a case in which the two lenses were asymmetrical, one being
larger than the other. The patient also had corneal metaplasia,
complete coloboma of iris and fundus.</p>
      <p>The mechanism for this anomaly is not known yet. Whether
it is part of a phylentogenic spectra or represents development
from two embryonically separate lens remains a question. Duke
Elder has tried to explain the occurrence of the two entities
based on separate embryonic developmental sequences.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> He
suggested that the metaplastic changes in the surface ectoderm
leads the lens plate to invaginate at two place and forms two
lens vesicles which results in double lens.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> This suggests that
the lens is divided before the lens starts developing.</p>
      <p>Our case has a deep furrow in the center <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> with
localized absence of zonules. We, therefore, suggest that once
the deep furrow is formed due to absence of zonules, it may
go further (deep) enough to divide the lens into two distinct
parts. Therefore, the absence of zonules is significant and these
furrows may be deep enough and progress to duplication. It
is a possibility that the lens duplication might be occurring
when the lens vesicle is single and it is the laxity and abnormal
stretching which causes the deep furrow and possibly
duplication. Duplication may be the extreme form of such a
bilobed, furrowed lens. It is interesting to note that both the
cases previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> had lens place in a straight axis at
opposite ends. This gives further credence to our theory of the
fissure dividing the lens into two and the remaining zonules
pulling them away from each other.</p>
      <p>Since lens coloboma occurs frequently such deep furrows
(bilobed lens) are uncommon. We believe that it represents the
missing link between the colobomatous lens and duplicated
lens. We understand that a single case report may not be
suggestive of any mechanism but nevertheless it does indicate
a possible mechanism of lens duplication.</p>
