      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Standard care for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) has been a combination of pegylated interferon-alpha (Peg-INF&#x3B1;) and ribavirin, although this treatment has suboptimal antiviral efficacy and significant adverse events.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Even in the latest treatment recommendation using novel direct acting antiviral agents, interferon (IFN)-based treatments are still optional.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The main drawbacks of interferon-based treatment are unsatisfactory response rate and various adverse effects, which often lead to premature termination of treatment followed by treatment failure.

      <title>CASE PRESENTATION</title>
      <p>A 47-year-old male patient presented with a complaining of sudden diplopia that developed one week after 11-week of antiviral combination treatment for chronic hepatitis C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). Ophthalmologic examinations revealed ptosis and restricted eye movement on the right eyelid. He had been on antiviral combination treatment with Peg-IFN-&#x3B1;2a (180&#x200A;&#x3BC;g/wk) (Pegasys<sup>&#xAE;</sup>; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and ribavirin (1000&#x200A;mg/d) (LG Ribavirin; LG Life Sciences, Seoul, Korea) for the genotype 1b hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The pretreatment serum HCV RNA level was 2.32&#x200A;&#xD7;&#x200A;10<sup>7</sup> IU/mL and AST/ALT levels were 255/323&#x200A;U/L. At 6-week of treatment, WBC count decreased to 2500/mm<sup>3</sup> and absolute neutrophil count was 725/mm<sup>3</sup>. The dosage of Peg-IFN-&#x3B1;2a was reduced to 90&#x200A;&#x3BC;g/wk, but WBC count continued decreasing to 2000/mm<sup>3</sup>. Five weeks later, the absolute neutrophil count was 500/mm<sup>3</sup> and the serum HCV RNA level was below the limit of detection (&lt;15&#x200A;IU/mL). Consequently, the antiviral treatment was promptly discontinued and the neutropenia improved on serial blood tests. One week after discontinuation of antiviral treatment, the patient complained of sudden diplopia and right eye ptosis was observed. One week later, right eye ptosis and upper extremities weakness (Grade III) were noted. He was immediately hospitalized and initial physical examination was normal except facial palsy with the right ptosis, mild dyspnea, and upper extremities weakness. Upon admission, he denied any other oral medications and had no history of vascular or thyroid diseases.</p>

      <p>On further evaluation, the low rate repetitive nerve stimulation test (Jolly test) and Neostigmine test were positive findings for myasthenia gravis (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and serum antiacetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR) antibody level of 14.95&#x200A;nmol/L (normal range: below 0.2&#x200A;nmol/L). Initial symptoms of ocular MG progressed to difficulties in chewing and swallowing, followed by respiratory failure in 3 days. Administration of pyridostigmine (Mestinon<sup>&#xAE;</sup>) 180&#x200A;mg/day was started and chest CT scan was performed which revealed anterior mediastinal mass measuring 7&#x200A;cm in its greatest dimension, whereas brain imaging study was normal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The patient received a surgical thymectomy and a high-grade thymoma invading pericardium and pleura (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) was observed on the pathological examination of the surgical specimen, which confirmed invasive thymoma (Type B3, WHO classification). The patient's respiratory failure aggravated after surgery, leading to an increased ventilator dependency. In response to the worsening respiratory condition, pyridostigmine dose was increased up to 600&#x200A;mg/d and intravenous immunoglobulin and high-dose steroid pulse therapy were started. Timeline for hospital course and treatment was presented (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). After 40 days of intensive care, the patient has his ocular symptoms back to normal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B) and was successfully weaned from the mechanical ventilator. He was able to walk on discharge with maintenance medications of steroid and pyridostigmine. However, his serum HCV RNA became detectable again.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Treatment for CHC with combination of peg-INF and ribavirin eradicates HCV RNA in &#x223C;40% to 50% of treatment-naive patients infected with HCV genotype 1.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In early clinical trials, &#x223C;10% to 14% of treated patients discontinue combination treatment prematurely due to various adverse events and IFN was the major concern in most of them.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Unsatisfactory response rate and high rate of unbearable side effects have been the major issues of conventional combination therapy.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Recently, direct acting antiviral agents (DAA) against HCV were developed and showed markedly improved clinical efficacy than the conventional combination treatment in terms of both potency and safety aspects.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> New standards of treatments using direct acting antivirals are being established and rapidly replacing the conventional combination therapy. However, the conventional combination treatment is still widely prescribed for CHC and IFN is not completely excluded from some of the DAA-based new regimens yet. Therefore, for the treatment of CHC it is still major concern of clinicians to cope with the various side effects of IFN.</p>
      <p>MG in patients with CHC were mostly associated with IFN treatment, but it may develop without IFN administration. Two case reports <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> described development of MG in CHC patients who did not receive antiviral treatment. A 35-year-old male patients with established CHC for several years without any treatment developed MG<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and a 59-year-old male with liver cirrhosis as a result of long-standing HCV infection developed typical MG symptoms and died due to myasthenia crisis.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The authors suggested the cross-reactivity between HCV epitopes and the acetylcholine receptor as the underlying mechanism. The etiologic roles of various viral infections including HCV were suggested for the development of MG, but the exact significance of HCV infection per se is not clear.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Though MG was not reported in large-scale analyses of CHC patients who received IFN treatment,<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> literatures suggesting the association between MG and IFN administration have been published in the form of case reports.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> There were 12 cases of MG by IFN for CHC including 6 myasthenia crisis cases (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In case reports of myasthenia crisis that developed during IFN-based antiviral treatment for CHC, male patients &gt;44 were most commonly affected and the mean age of patients was 57 years and mean interval between starting IFN administration and diagnosis of MG was 4.57 months (6 weeks to 15 months). The mean duration of IFN treatment was 4.96 months (6 weeks to 15 months). The mean level of anti-AchR antibody was high as 16.3&#x200A;nmol/L. The ocular symptom was the most common presenting symptom. In most patients, respiratory distress followed advanced progression of MG symptoms and a case of severe respiratory failure was reported at 6 months after IFN discontinuation.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The clinical courses of MG cases by IFN for CHC were either mild or severe enough to suffer myasthenia crisis, but most of the patients were recovered eventually with medical care after discontinuing IFN treatment.</p>

      </table-wrap>
      <p>To our knowledge, this is the second case of thymoma-associated MG during IFN treatment for CHC. A case of MG that progressed to myasthenic crisis was reported at 1996 in Japanese patient who had thymomectomy for known thymoma-associated MG, 19 years before starting antiviral treatment.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Thymomas are responsible for 21% of MG cases and &#x223C;30% of patients with thymoma have symptoms of MG.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Myasthenic crisis is the most serious complication of MG and thymoma is one of the risk factors attributed to it.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The mechanism of MG development by IFN therapy is not completely understood, but some of the complex immunological actions of IFN such as enhanced lymphocyte cytotoxicity, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inhibition of T suppressor cell function, activation of T helper lymphocytes by autoantigens, and differentiation of antigen-presenting cell might contribute to the development of IFN-induced autoimmune diseases.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The thymus plays a primary role in early-onset MG mediated by anti-AChR antibodies.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> IFN-beta could play a central role in thymic events leading to MG by triggering the overexpression of a-AChR probably leading to thymic dendritic cells autosensitization, the abnormal recruitment of peripheral cells, and germinal center formation.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The epithelial neoplastic cells of thymoma are capable of presenting epitopes, which cross-reacts with different neuromuscular antigens. In addition to AChR antibodies, antibodies against striated muscle titin and RyR antigens are found in most of MG thymoma patients.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p>
      <p>On the other, it has also been suggested that some infectious viruses and HCV itself may lead to MG via mechanism of cross-reactivity between viral epitopes and the acetylcholine receptor.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p>
      <p>It is not known whether the patients who experienced MG during IFN treatment for CHC had subclinical MG before initiating treatment because pretreatment screening for MG is not routinely recommended. In some patients, pre-existing subclinical MG that might be associated with HCV infection itself, progress to overt MG during IFN treatment, whereas, in others, de novo MG might be induced by IFN administration.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> In our patient, relatively large thymoma was diagnosed in the advanced stage after a short period of IFN administration. So it seems that thymoma-associated subclinical MG were unrecognized before treatment, which was provoked by IFN administration to progress to life-threatening myasthenic crisis. For the better understanding of clinical implication of IFN-induced MG in CHC treatment, screening for MG in CHC patient might be considered before starting treatment or at least, during treatment when the patient complained of fatigue, muscle weakness.</p>
      <p>Screening for MG with serum anti-AChR antibody test is simple and helpful in many patients, but it needs further investigation in this clinical condition because some of MG patients have serum anti-AChR antibody levels within normal range.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="conclusion">
      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>In patients with CHC who is going to receive IFN-based antiviral treatment, whether screening for thymoma or subclinical MG should be included in basal evaluation is not clear but physicians need to keep in mind the potential life-threatening manifestations of MG before and during antiviral treatment especially when patients complain of muscular weakness and easy fatigability.</p>
