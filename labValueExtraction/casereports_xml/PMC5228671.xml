          <p>SAPHO (Synovitis-Acne-Pustulosis-Hyperstosis-Osteitis) syndrome is a rare disease featured by its dermatological and osteoarthritic disorders, the latter of which mainly affecting the anterior chest wall, spine, and sacroiliac joint. However, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease, mainly affecting the synovial tissue of small joints in hands and feet. Here, we present an extremely rare case diagnosed with both SAPHO syndrome and RA, with an onset interval of 10 years. So far, only 1 similar case has been reported in the English literature.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>SAPHO (Synovitis-Acne-Pustulosis-Hyperstosis-Osteitis) syndrome is a rare disease featured by its dermatological and osteoarthritic disorders.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> The osteoarthritic disorders mainly affect the anterior chest wall (ACW, including sternoclavicular, manubriosternal, and costosternal joints), the spine and sacroiliac joint.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> However, the appendicular skeleton, especially the small joint is a less frequently affected site in SAPHO.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Howver, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease mainly affecting the synovial tissue in joint, which can result in joint damage.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> It is seropositive for rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody, with a predilection on small joints of the hand and wrist.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup></p>
      <p>Here, we present an extremely rare case with both SAPHO syndrome and RA. In our patient, clinical features for SAPHO syndrome appeared in about 10 years after the definite diagnosis of RA. This is a rare and exceptional condition. So far, only 1 similar case has been reported in the English literature.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> With this case report, we want to draw attention to diverse features of SAPHO syndrome.</p>

      <title>Case report</title>
      <p>A 59-year-old female patient presented with pain in proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and wrist joints of bilateral hands accompanied by morning stiffness since March 2005 and was diagnosed as RA based on RF positivity and anti-CCP antibody of 437AU/mL at local hospital. The results of laboratory tests were shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Oral corticosteroid (prednisone, 20&#x200A;mg qd) was prescribed, and symptoms were effectively alleviated. 2 months later, the patient's symptoms remained stable, and maintenance doses of prednisone (10&#x200A;mg qd) and leflunomide (10&#x200A;mg qd) were introduced for RA. Symptoms of RA were successfully controlled with prednisone and leflunomide ever since.</p>

      <p>In April 2015, she was presented to local hospital complaining of low back pain, left sternoclavicular joint pain, and PPP in succession within 1 month. X-rays showed degenerative changes of the lumbar spine. CT showed focal cortical erosion with slight sclerosis of left sternoclavicular joint. The results of laboratory tests showed elevated inflammatory markers, and details were shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. A diagnosis of SAPHO syndrome was made. Oral corticosteroid therapy (prednisone 15&#x200A;mg qd) was introduced for 2 months. However, after slight remission, relapse occurred in both dermatological and osteoarthritic symptoms.</p>
      <p>In Sep 2015, the patient presented to our hospital, complaining of refractory low back pain, left sternoclavicular joint pain, and PPP. PPP was observed on physical examination (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A&#x2013;B). Laboratory tests showed elevated ESR of 22&#x200A;mm/h: seropositive RF and anti-CCP antibody of 302&#x200A;AU/mL (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Bone scintigraphy, CT and MRI of the whole spine, as well as MRI of the right hand were performed. Characteristic &#x201C;bull's head sign,&#x201D; which was caused by the tracer uptake in bilateral sternoclavicular joints, bilateral costosternal joints, and manubriosternal joint, was observed on bony scintigraphy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C). CT and MRI of the whole spine demonstrated multiple vertebral corner lesions in lumbar spine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A&#x2013;F). MRI of the right hand revealed thickened synovial membrane of PIP and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, as well as joint effusion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>G&#x2013;H). The reminder of imaging examinations was normal. A diagnosis of SAPHO syndrome in association with RA was made. Treatment with tripterygium wilfordii polyglycosidium (TWP, 0.6&#x200A;g tid) in combination with persistent prednisone (15&#x200A;mg qd) was introduced. Both dermatological and osteoarthritic symptoms improved.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>SAPHO syndrome is a unifying concept of a group of dermatological and osteoarthritic disorders.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> The pathogenesis of SAPHO syndrome involves infectious, immunologic, and genetic factors.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> More recently, some researchers have suggested that SAPHO syndrome should be classified within the spectrum of auto-inflammatory bone diseases.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> The natural history of SAPHO usually shows a relapsing-remitting course, with relatively good prognostics. Currently, the most widely used diagnostic criteria for SAPHO is the one proposed by Kahn and Khan in 1994,<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> for which the including criteria are as follows: (1) osteoarthritic involvement associated with palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) and psoriasis vulgaris; (2) osteoarthritic involvement associated with severe acne; (3) isolated sterile hyperostosis/osteitis (adults); (4) chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (children); and (5) osteoarthritic involvement associated with chronic bowel diseases.</p>
      <p>On admission to our hospital, the patient's characteristic PPP and &#x201C;bull's head sign&#x201D; on bony scintigraphy lead to an easy diagnosis of SAPHO syndrome.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> With regard to the low back pain, imaging examinations demonstrated multiple vertebral corner lesions. Unfortunately, the imaging manifestations of the lumbar spine were not specific for SAPHO and could also be explained by the degenerative changes.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Hence, we could not determine whether our patient was with spinal involvement in SAPHO syndrome or not. For the ACW and spinal involvement in our patient, ankylosing spondyloarthritis (AS) should also be taken into consideration for differential diagnosis.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> However, neither clinical symptoms nor imaging features supported this diagnosis.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Unfortunately, the HLA-B27 antigen was not tested for further confirmation.</p>
      <p>However, RA is a chronic autoimmune disease, which is characterized by inflammation and deterioration of the synovial joints.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> It can produce a loss of functionality and reduce quality of life.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> The seropositive RF and high-level anti-CCP antibody, as well as symptoms and MRI of right hand in our patient, which rarely occurred in SAPHO syndrome, were also highly suggestive of RA, according to the 2010&#x200A;ACR/EULAR diagnostic criteria for RA.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Therefore, a diagnosis of SAPHO syndrome in association with RA was made.</p>
      <p>A limited number of publications reported the prevalence of RF and anti-CCP antibody, which were significant predictors of RA, in patients with SAPHO syndrome. However, 1.2% of the patients were RF positive in our SAPHO cohort with 164 patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> In another study, anti-CCP antibody was negative in all the 69 patients tested.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Only 1 similar case who concurrently fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for both RA and SAPHO syndrome was previously reported.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> However, differently, our patient presented with SAPHO syndrome and RA with an onset interval of 10 years.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we reported a rare case of SAPHO syndrome in association with RA with a 10-year onset interval. SAPHO is a syndrome with diverse features, and we are expecting to see additional special cases.</p>
