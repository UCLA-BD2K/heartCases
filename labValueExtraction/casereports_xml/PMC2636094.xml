        <p>Dermis-fat graft (DFG) is often the only promising option in cases
of severely contracted sockets. However, there is an increased risk
of graft failure in irradiated sockets with decreased vascularity.
In such difficult cases, repeat DFG implantation also has higher
risks of graft failure.</p>
        <p>We describe an ingenious method of successful management
of an irradiated anophthalmic socket following DFG infection and
necrosis, with acceptable cosmetic results. At surgery, an orbital
impression was taken with ophthalmic grade alginate. Based on
this measurement, a custom-made stem pressure socket-expander
made up of high density polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) was
fitted, a week post surgery and kept <italic>in situ</italic> for six weeks.</p>
        <p>On review, the fornices had considerably deepened. The
expander device was removed and the patient was now fitted
with a custom-made thicker prosthesis made up of high-density
PMMA. The patient has followed up for a year subsequently and
the prosthesis has remained stable.</p>

    <p>Dermis-fat graft (DFG) is often the most promising option
in maintaining orbital volume, preserving the fornices and
conserving the conjunctiva in cases of complicated orbits and
contracted sockets. Although significant atrophy of primary
grafts does not occur very frequently,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> irradiated sockets
may have decreased vascularity and increased risks of graft
infection and failure. In such difficult cases, repeat DFG orbital
implantation may also suffer a slightly increased frequency and
amount of graft absorption.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></p>
    <p>We describe a method of successful management of an
irradiated anophthalmic socket following DFG infection, with
acceptable cosmetic results.</p>
    <p>We performed a Medline search with the key words
&#x2033;anophthalmic socket&#x2033;, &#x2033;contracted socket&#x2033; &#x2033;socket expansion&#x2033;
&#x2033;dermis-fat graft failure&#x2033; and various combinations thereof.
All cross-references in citing literature were included in our
search and referenced. To the best of our knowledge, a similar
technique has not been reported previously on irradiated
socket.</p>
    <sec sec-type="">
      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>A three-year-old boy presented to us with a contracted right
socket and history of prosthesis instability, since one year. He
had been enucleated elsewhere for retinoblastoma of the right
eye, one year prior to presentation, without orbital implant.
Subsequently, the right socket had received irradiation, details
of which were unavailable. The fitted prosthesis was extremely
unstable with repeated extrusion.</p>
      <p>On examination, the left eye was unremarkable. The right
socket was quiet, healthy with evidence of severe surface and
volume contracture. The patient underwent DFG implantation,
under general anesthesia. A conformer for socket maintenance
was inserted, on table, post surgery. The patient was started
on topical betamethasone eye drops and oral antibiotics (an
Ampicillin-Cloxacillin combination was used), post surgery.
On review, a week later, the graft was taking up satisfactorily.
The oral antibiotics were stopped, the topical steroids were
tapered off and the patient was asked to review with us six
weeks later. However, the patient presented to us three weeks
later with a painful inflamed socket. On examination, the socket
was severely infected with copious discharge. The DFG had
sloughed off completely [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1A">Fig. 1A</xref>]. The socket inflammation was
treated with topical antibiotics, anti-inflammatory and systemic
antibiotic medication. The patient was reviewed at one week
and at three weeks. At three weeks, the orbital inflammation
had subsided completely. The fornices were seen to be severely
shallow (Grade IV contracture)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> and there was severe volume
contracture (Grade IV),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> as before. At this stage, the options
of a second DFG or a larger prosthesis, to compensate for the
volume loss, were considered. However, it was impossible
for the patient to retain a conformer or any prosthesis at this
stage, due to the extreme surface as well as volume contracture.
Considering the possible high risk of DFG failure, the patient&#x2032;s
parents were not in favor of another surgical procedure. It was
under these circumstances that a new technique was attempted,
with informed consent.</p>
      <p>An orbital impression was taken with ophthalmic grade
alginate [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1B">Fig. 1B</xref>]. Based on this measurement, a custom-made
stem pressure socket-expander was made from high-density
polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and fitted a week later
[<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1C">Fig. 1C</xref>]. This conformer was kept <italic>in situ</italic> for six weeks, with
pressure exerted by a tight sticking tape on the stem of the
conformer [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1D">Fig. 1D</xref>]. Instructions to change this tape every
six-hourly, to ensure adequate sticking and sufficient pressure
to the socket expander, were given to the patient.</p>
      <p>On review, six weeks later, the expander device was removed
and the socket examined. The socket surface had completely
lined with the conjunctiva and the fornices had deepened
sufficiently to accommodate a conformer. We documented
the expansion of the socket objectively with our ingeniously
devised slit-lamp measurement device.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></p>
      <p>The patient was now fitted with a custom-made thicker
prosthesis made up of high-density PMMA [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2A">Fig. 2A</xref>]. Cosmesis
was satisfactory [Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2B">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2C">C</xref>]. The patient has been
followed up for a year and the prosthesis has remained stable.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In a case of failed DFG in an irradiated socket; expansile
expanders can be used. Other useful described techniques
include prefabricated temporalis muscle and/or fascia pedicled
flap along with fornix formation sutures, which are to be
retained for a minimum of three weeks.</p>
      <p>We treated a patient with DFG necrosis and a severely
contracted anophthalmic socket with a custom-made stem
pressure socket expander device. This device helped deepen
the fornices, with stable prosthesis placement subsequently.
The prosthesis was thicker to ensure adequate volume
replacement and was made up of high-grade PMMA to
ensure lesser weight. This prosthesis also had a superior shelf
extending backwards into the socket, to provide additional
stability. This provided acceptable cosmesis, under the
circumstances.</p>
      <p>We documented the expansion of the socket objectively with
the slit-lamp measurement device. Though it might be difficult
to envisage socket expansion solely due to the mechanical
pressure exerted by a tape running from the forehead to the
cheek, the expansion was possibly due to a combination of the
shape of the socket expander, its reach deep into the socket
and the mechanical force applied by the sticking tape, changed
repeatedly, to ensure proper sticking.</p>
      <p>The use of a pressure conformer has been previously
described in the literature,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> but to the best of our knowledge,
the entire procedure of fitting a special prosthesis post socket
expansion, in these patients with severely contracted sockets,
has not yet been described in the literature. However, it is
worthwhile to remember that this case of single-time placement
of a non-expansile custom-made stem pressure socket expander
in an avascular irradiated socket needs to be conducted on a
larger sample size with a longer duration of follow-up, to judge
the true efficacy of this procedure.</p>
