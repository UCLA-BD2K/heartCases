        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>To report a minimally invasive paraspinal approach in the treatment of a case of spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma (SSEH). We additionally aim to review the relevant literature to enhance our knowledge of this disease. SSEH is an uncommon but potentially catastrophic disease. Currently, most appropriate management is emergence decompression laminectomy and hematoma evacuation. An 81-year-old woman was admitted to the neurology department with a chief complaint of bilateral numbness and weakness of the lower limbs and difficulty walking for 4 days with progressive weakness developed over the following 3 days accompanied with pain in the lower limbs and lower back. No history of trauma was reported. Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracolumbar spine demonstrated an epidural hematoma extending from T-12 to L-5 with thecal sac and cauda equina displacement anterior. The patient was treated in our department with a minimally invasive approach. This operation method had been approved by Chinese Independent Ethics Committee. Three months following the operation, the patient had regained the ability to walk with the aid of a cane and myodynamia tests revealed normal results for the left lower limb and a 4/5 grade for the right limb. Importantly, no complications were exhibited from the surgical operation. The minimally invasive paraspinal approach through tubular retractors is demonstrated here as an effective alternative method for the treatment of SSEH.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma (SSEH) is an uncommon condition with an uncertain etiology that results in permanent neurological deficit or death when not treated appropriately.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> This disease represents 0.3% to 0.9% of all epidural space-occupying lesions.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup></p>
      <p>It is characterized by the initial manifestation of sudden-onset acute back or neck pain around the affected vertebra followed by the rapid progression of neurological dysfunction, which is caused by compression of the thecal sac and cauda equina.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Many cases can be diagnosed upon detailed neurological examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Despite this, the etiology of SSEE remains elusive in many cases, with no definitive inciting event. Numerous risk factors have been reported including anticoagulant therapy, aspirin, coronary thrombolysis, lumbar puncture, hypertension, and ankylosing spondylitis.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup></p>
      <p>Most surgeons advocate aggressive and prompt surgical intervention for SSEH cases, interventions which may cause thecal sac and cauda equina compression and neurological dysfunction. Today, the most widely used surgical approach is laminectomy.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup></p>
      <p>Here we reported a case of SSEH partial recovery from neurological dysfunction after minimal invasive laminectomy through tubular retractors. In our department, we have generally used this approach to treat disc herniation, intraspinal tumors, and spinal stenosis. This procedure is similar to partial laminectomy with the exception of using a tubular retractor instead of an open approach (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p>

      <title>Case</title>
      <p>An 81-year-old woman was admitted to the neurology department experiencing persistent mild frequent urination and dysuria for 1 year without any reported inducing factors. The symptoms developed included numbness and weakness of the bilateral lower limbs and difficulty walking (more severe in the right lower extremity) 4 days before admission. Progressive weakness developed over the next 3 days accompanied with pain in the lower limbs and lower back.</p>
      <p>Upon neurological examination, weakness was noted in the right lower and left lower extremities at grades of 0/5(R) and 3/5(L), respectively, according to the Medical Research Council grading scale. The bilateral lower-limb exhibited normal muscle tension though deep-tendon reflexes appeared absent and Babinski sign was negative. A digital rectal examination indicated that rectal tone was normal for the patient. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. During sensory examination, this patient was not cooperative. The patient's medical history did not reveal any notable events. At the moment of admission, the patient's blood pressure was 158/78&#x200A;mmHg and initial laboratory tests (including complete blood count, chemistry panel, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and coagulation evaluation) revealed no remarkable contributions.</p>
      <p>After initial consultation, this patient was admitted to our department. The day after admission, MRI of the thoracolumbar spine demonstrated an epidural hematoma extending from T-12 to L-5 with thecal sac and cauda equina displacement anterior (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Neurological deficits did not show any improvement during the course of the following 3 days. We next explained the condition of the disease and the operative method to the patient and her family. She was taken to the operating room for an emergency surgical decompression after the patient provided informed consent. After general anesthesia, the patient was placed in prone position. On the left side of the skin which is distant from midline 2&#x200A;cm in T12, L3 level and right side of the skin which is distant from midline 2&#x200A;cm in L2, L5 level, we made 4 longitudinal incisions about 2&#x200A;cm length (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>E). Separation of subcutaneous tissue reaching the muscle fascia and the paraspinal muscle was bluntly separated to lamina from the space of the multifidus and longissimus. A tubular retractor device was inserted in this space and the appropriate position was ascertained under x-ray. High-speed burr was used to grind off the lower edge of the T12, L2, L3, and L4 lamina and the upper edges of the L1, L2, and L5 lamina (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C), preventing damage to the zygapophysial joints and then dissected the ligamenta flava. The intraspinal dark red hematoma compressing the thecal sac and cauda equina were visible (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A) and an aspirator and detacher were used to evacuate the hematoma. The hematoma in the vertebral canal, which is adjacent to the tube, could then also be eliminated via adjustment of the angle of the tube. After evacuation all the hematoma, hydrogen peroxide and povidone&#x2013;iodine was used to wash the operative cavity until we could clearly observe the dural thecal sac expansion and cerebrospinal fluid pulsation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). Drainage catheters were positioned at the intraspinal extradural after operation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D). The duration of the operation was about 3&#x200A;h and the total blood loss was about 50&#x200A;mL. No complications related to the surgical procedure were observed.</p>

      <p>In the first 24 postoperative hours, there was no significant improvement in neurologic function. Physical examination similarly showed no change compared to preoperative results. The lower back and bilateral lower limb pain was reportedly relieved on the third postoperative day; moreover, there was an obvious improvement in the tendon reflexes of bilateral lower limbs as blunt tendon reflexes were observed. On the tenth postoperative day, the patient returned to normal urination and the catheter was removed. The left lower extremity showed improvement during postoperative recovery and muscle strength examination was normal by the tenth day after surgery. The condition of the right lower extremity was not apparently improved as muscle force examination received a grade of 1/5 until the patient was discharged. By the 3-month follow-up examination, however, the patient could walk slowly with the help of a cane and myodynamia testing of right lower limb received a grade of 4/5.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The pathogenesis of SSEH remains controversial. Patel et al<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"> c</xref>onsidered that the bleeding is of venous origin. He supposed the mechanism that reversal of blood flow in the valveless epidural venous plexus caused by activities such as evacuation, sneezing, bending, coughing, and coitus could result in rupture of a fragile vein. Those activities could lead to the change of intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure. Beside this, traction on nerve roots during operations lead to disruption of the tortuous arterial plexus was suggested to be another source of epidural hematoma. Taking into consideration that the pressure in the epidural veins is less than intrathecal pressure (confirmed by the common observation that the normally expanded dural sac may tamponade epidural venous bleeding encountered during surgical procedures), Beatty and Winston<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> hypothesized that arterial source bleeding is the main cause of acute SSEH. However, Groen<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> has proposed that the majority of SSEH actually results from a rupture of the posterior internal vertebral venous plexus, in a review of 199 cases of SSEH. He has also considered that the rupture of the epidural artery might be responsible for some cases of SSEH. The anatomical structure of human vertebra canal usually restricts epidural hematomas to the dorsal aspect of the epidural space with possible extension to the lateral gutters.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> In these cases, epidural hematoma is presented in the dorsal aspect, where the definitive cause of SSEH cannot be defined.</p>
      <p>Various factors had been reported in the etiology of SSEH, such as anticoagulant therapy, aspirin, coronary thrombolysis, lumbar puncture, hypertension, ankylosing spondylitis, and vascular malformation.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Patient age also appears to highly affect the level distribution of SSEH as people who are less than 40 years old commonly experience SSEH localized to the cervicothoracic region, whereas patients over 40 years old usually experience SSEH in the cervicothoracic and thoracolumbar regions.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Our patient, who is 81 years old, presented a hematoma in the T12&#x2013;L5, in accordance with the literature. The patient, however, presented no obvious causal factors for SSEH.</p>
      <p>The typical symptoms of SSEH include a sudden onset of neck or back pain at the involved vertebral level with radiating pain, followed by rapid and progressive signs and symptoms of thecal sac and cauda equina compression.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> MRI, myelography and computed tomography (CT) are commonly used to diagnose spinal epidural hematomas; however, CT cannot be used to determine when bleeding occurred and as such presents a limitation in terms of differential diagnosis. On the contrary, MRI affords a superior diagnostic capability and has replaced CT and myelography as the main diagnostic tool.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> MRI can inform the precise position of the hematoma, the extent and time frame of the bleeding, detection of thecal sac and cauda equina compression, and spinal cord edema.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> The patient presented here received MRI examination on the sixth day after the initial presentation of symptoms. In this case, we could see an obvious long-segmented SSEH had compressed and displaced thecal sac and cauda equina extending from the T12 to L5 (sagittal view by T2-weighted MRI). This SSEH demonstrated isointensity and slight hyperintensity by T1-weighted MRI and isointensity and hypointensity by T2-weighted MRI; this is in accordance with the subacute manifestation of hematoma in MRI. In axial T2-weighted MRI, we could clearly observe thecal sac and cauda equina compression and pushing to the left side of spinal canal.</p>
      <p>Neurological recovery is multifactorial. Preoperative neurological status and the time interval to surgery appear to be 2 critical factors influencing the prognosis of SSEH. A longer interval to surgery is detrimental to a positive neurological outcome,<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> on the other hand, Foo et al. hold the opinion that there is no correlation between interval surgery and neurological outcome.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Shin et al<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> speculated that early decompression (&gt;12&#x200A;hours constraining the ischemic change) yields a more favorable recovery. They have also suggested that patients who experience early incomplete motor and sensory loss have a better chance at neurological recovery. Liao et al<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> also reported that patients with preoperative incomplete neurological deficits had a better neurological recovery than patients with preoperative complete neurological deficits. Furthermore, prompt surgery (less than 48&#x200A;hours from the initial onset of symptoms and less than 12&#x200A;hours of complete neurological deficits) could also achieve a satisfactory neurological recovery in patients with preoperative complete neurological deficits. In our treatment, the patient was not diagnosed for the first time in our hospital though was admitted to our neurology department for conservative treatment. Patient underwent surgery more than 6 days from the onset of symptoms and complete motor neurological deficit was observed in this patient.</p>
      <p>The mainstream treatment of SSEH is emergency decompression and evacuation of the hematoma for prevention of permanent neurological deficits.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Some authors have suggested that in patients who demonstrate continual signs of clinical improvement and stability, conservative treatment may be adopted.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Currently, the standard operation method for SSEH is the open laminectomy method. Iida Y reported that resection of the whole lamina, spinous process, medial part of the facet joint, and flavum ligament seems to play an important role in the occurrence or progress of instability. The author also suggested that in the presence of adequate indications, partial laminectomy should be selected to avoid the occurrence or progress of instability at the operated level.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> Muscular atrophy is another complication of open laminectomy which may occur due to the damage of the paraspinal muscles.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> In addition, asymmetry of the paraspinal muscle may also influence the occurrence of postoperative instability,<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> preservation of paraspinal muscle and decrease the incidence of muscular injury&#x2014;the most important factors associated with a positive long-term clinical outcome.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Marjan Alimi et al. have also reported that minimally invasive laminectomy has a lower rate of postoperative instability, reduced blood loss, and a shorter hospital stay than the conventional open laminectomy method.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> In this case report, a minimally invasive surgery was performed to decompress and evacuate hematoma via paraspinal approach through tubular retractors. Through this alternative method, we are able to grind a hole on the skipped lamina with no damage to the zygapophysis. Moreover, through this approach, a smaller trauma of the paraspinal muscles was achieved owing to the tubular retractor system. Smaller intraoperative blood loss and shorter duration of postoperative pain are the other 2 advantages compared with standard laminectomy. In this case study, the intraoperative blood loss was about 50&#x200A;mL and the patient did not feel obvious wound pain 3 days after surgery. Additionally, postoperative MRI showed complete removal of the SSEH, the thecal sac and spinal cord expansion and recovery (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A&#x2013;C). We report that through this surgical approach, surgery channels were small and the zygapophysis maintained integrity in postoperative CT scan and reconstructed 3-dimensional CT scan (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A&#x2013;C). During the 3-month follow-up, spinal instability was found and the walking capability of the patient was observed to be gradually improving.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>The minimally invasive surgery used to decompress the spinal canal and evacuate the hematoma via paraspinal approach through tubular retractors may be an effective alternative method to treat SSEH. This method has the advantages of causing minimal damage to the spinal bony structure, only a minor trauma to the paraspinal muscles, and a relatively short postoperative pain recovery time.</p>
