          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Pancreatic islet endocrine cell-supporting architectures, including islet encapsulating basement membranes (BMs), extracellular matrix (ECM), and possible cell clusters, are unclear.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Procedures</title>
          <p>The architectures around islet cell clusters, including BMs, ECM, and pancreatic acinar-like cell clusters, were studied in the non-diabetic state and in the inflamed milieu of fulminant type 1 diabetes in humans.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Result</title>
          <p>Immunohistochemical and electron microscopy analyses demonstrated that human islet cell clusters and acinar-like cell clusters adhere directly to each other with desmosomal structures and coated-pit-like structures between the two cell clusters. The two cell-clusters are encapsulated by a continuous capsule composed of common BMs/ECM. The acinar-like cell clusters have vesicles containing regenerating (REG) I&#x3B1; protein. The vesicles containing REG I&#x3B1; protein are directly secreted to islet cells. In the inflamed milieu of fulminant type 1 diabetes, the acinar-like cell clusters over-expressed REG I&#x3B1; protein. Islet endocrine cells, including beta-cells and non-beta cells, which were packed with the acinar-like cell clusters, show self-replication with a markedly increased number of Ki67-positive cells.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>The acinar-like cell clusters touching islet endocrine cells are distinct, because the cell clusters are packed with pancreatic islet clusters and surrounded by common BMs/ECM. Furthermore, the acinar-like cell clusters express REG I&#x3B1; protein and secrete directly to neighboring islet endocrine cells in the non-diabetic state, and the cell clusters over-express REG I&#x3B1; in the inflamed milieu of fulminant type 1 diabetes with marked self-replication of islet cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>During research into the destruction and regeneration of islet cells in fulminant type 1 diabetes (FT1DM) <xref rid="pone.0095110-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0095110-Aida1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, impressive pancreatic acinar-like cell clusters over-expressing regenerating (Reg) gene protein I&#x3B1; (REG I&#x3B1;) <xref rid="pone.0095110-Terazono1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> have been found just beside islet cell clusters. We first studied the anatomical relationship between the basement membranes (BMs) and extra cellular matrix (ECM) surrounding islet cell clusters and the acinar-like cell clusters around the islets that express REG I&#x3B1; proteins in non-diabetic human pancreas. Then, the topographic relationship between islet cell clusters and acinar-like cell clusters, which are present around islet cell clusters and express REG I&#x3B1; proteins, was studied. Finally, <italic>in situ</italic> changes in REG I&#x3B1;-expressing acinar-like cell clusters, islet vasculature, and BMs/ECM around the islets in the inflamed milieu of FT1DM were examined.</p>
      <p>The capsule comprising BMs and ECM surrounding mature islet cell clusters is vital for their normal growth and renewal, and for protection against inflammation, especially from type 1 diabetes <xref rid="pone.0095110-IrvingRodgers1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095110-Korpos1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In addition, BMs and ECM surrounding islet cell clusters are increasingly important because they have a major effect on engraftment in islet cell transplantation <xref rid="pone.0095110-Kragl1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Furthermore, beta cell tropic factors, including regenerating (Reg) gene proteins <xref rid="pone.0095110-Terazono1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and other growth factors, are expressed in exocrine pancreas cells near the islets <xref rid="pone.0095110-Inada1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Recent studies have demonstrated that progenitor cells of islet beta cells potentially reside in the exocrine (acino-ductal) pancreas <xref rid="pone.0095110-Inada1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Adult human pancreatic islets and pancreatic exocrine cells are assumed to be covered by their own capsules and are separated from each other, making it difficult for them to communicate directly <xref rid="pone.0095110-Dewitt1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0095110-BonnerWeir1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, the precise topographic and physiological relationships between the islets and the nearby exocrine cell clusters remain completely unclear in humans.</p>
      <p>FT1DM is characterized by abrupt-onset diabetes usually related to viral infection, followed by accelerated innate and adaptive immune reactions <xref rid="pone.0095110-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0095110-Aida1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095110-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095110-Imagawa1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We demonstrated that, in the non-diabetic state, islet cell clusters and pancreatic acinar-like cell clusters adhere directly to each other and are encapsulated by continuous BMs and ECM. The acinar-like cells exocytosed REG I&#x3B1; molecules to islet cells directly. In the inflamed milieu of FT1DM, an increased number of Ki67-positive regenerating islet cells in contact with REG I&#x3B1;-over-expressing acinar cell-like clusters was observed. Acinar-like cell clusters packed with islet cell clusters may have specific roles in islet cell replication.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The ATLANTIS was located beside the islet cell cluster and secreted REG I&#x3B1; protein to islet cells. The two cell clusters, islet cells and ATLANTIS, were encapsulated by continuous BMs and ECM. In the inflamed milieu of type 1 diabetes, it was observed that ATLANTIS over-expressed REG I&#x3B1; protein and islet cells were replicated.</p>
      <p>It has been assumed that islet endocrine cell clusters are independent of surrounding pancreatic exocrine tissues and separated from them by capsules composed of BMs and ECM in some species, including humans <xref rid="pone.0095110-Bensley1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095110-BonnerWeir1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095110-Virtanen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The precise structure of capsules around the islets varies across species <xref rid="pone.0095110-VanDeijnen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In canine pancreas, peri-insular capsules completely cover the islet cells, while the capsules of the islets in human and rodents are extremely thin or discontinuous in parts <xref rid="pone.0095110-BonnerWeir1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095110-VanDeijnen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0095110-Bendayan2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. To the best of our knowledge, anatomical packing of islet cell clusters and acinar-like cell clusters within the same space and demonstration of a direct effect of REG I&#x3B1; on islet cells have not been previously documented. It is conceivable that islet cell clusters and ATLANTIS are encapsulated by continuous BMs and ECM, because the two clusters grew from ductal organs covered by their original continuous BMs in the fetal period. Fibronectin, laminin, and type IV collagens were used as markers of capsules composed of BMs and ECM, which surround islet and acinar-like cell clusters <xref rid="pone.0095110-Virtanen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095110-Kragl2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0095110-Cirulli1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Fibronectin, laminin, and type IV collagens are involved in the adhesion and spread of fetal and adult islet cells, and the fibronectin- and laminine-containing pancreatic ECM forms the template for developing islets <xref rid="pone.0095110-Kragl2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0095110-Cirulli1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The physiological role of ATLANTIS in the non-diabetic state appears related to maintaining beta cells and other subsets of islet endocrine cells through secreting REG I&#x3B1; proteins in a paracrine/autocrine manner, filling the microenvironment containing islet cells and ATLANTIS covered by distinct BMs and ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095110-g004">Figure 4C and D</xref>). REG I&#x3B1;-knockout mice show decreased islet cell replication <xref rid="pone.0095110-Unno1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In the inflamed milieu of FT1DM, in which islet beta cells and non-beta cells were damaged, REG I&#x3B1; proteins were over-expressed in the ATLANTIS. This suggests that ATLANTIS and BMs and ECM encapsulating islets are a growth niche for both islet cell replication and putative islet stem cell differentiation. In fact, FT1DM islet endocrine cells in the same capsule showed marked proliferation via increased numbers of Ki67<sup>+</sup> islet cells, although islet cell replication should be cautiously interpreted due to possible bias from the small number of samples. As shown in our previous reports <xref rid="pone.0095110-Tanaka2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095110-Aida1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, inflammatory cytokines and subsequent products of cytokine cascades are rich in the islets in FT1DM. The <italic>REG I&#x3B1;</italic> gene has an IL-6 responsive element at the upstream region <xref rid="pone.0095110-Akiyama1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, and pro-inflammatory cytokines including interferon (IFN)&#x3B3;, TNF&#x3B1;, IL-12, and IL-18 have been shown to up-regulate the expression of REG I&#x3B1; in pancreatic acinar AR42J cells <xref rid="pone.0095110-Dusetti1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095110-Sennello1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Thus, it is conceivable that REG I&#x3B1; responded to the inflamed milieu and produced exaggerated amounts of REG I&#x3B1; protein to promote the regeneration of damaged islet beta cells. It has already been reported that islet cells, at least beta cells, have REG protein receptors and are affected in an autocrine/paracrine manner <xref rid="pone.0095110-Kobayashi2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Expressions of REG family proteins, including REG III&#x3B1; and REG IV, have been reported in the type 1 diabetic condition (insulitis) in rodent models <xref rid="pone.0095110-Baeza1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0095110-Parikh1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, in the present study, over-expression of REG III&#x3B1; and REG IV was not observed in human type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0095110.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
      <p>It has been reported that serum levels of REG I&#x3B1; are increased in chronic pancreatitis and in type 2 diabetes <xref rid="pone.0095110-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, which is similar to FT1DM. We found over-expression of REG I&#x3B1; in ATLANTIS cells and pancreatic acinar cells in chronic pancreatitis but not in type 2 diabetes immunohistochemically (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0095110.s004">Figure S4</xref>). These findings may highlight a unique feature of over-expression of REG I&#x3B1; proteins in ATLANTIS cells in FT1DM.</p>
      <p>Exocytosis of components in the solubilized or vesicular form of REG I&#x3B1; molecules was seen from ATLANTIS to islet endocrine cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095110-g004">Figures 4C, D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095110-g005">5E and F</xref>). REG I&#x3B1; molecules in solubilized form will interact with REG I&#x3B1; receptors <xref rid="pone.0095110-Kobayashi2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> at the surface of beta cells. Direct internalization of REG I&#x3B1; molecules in the vesicular form to beta cells and alpha cells was also observed. The cell membrane of ATLANTIS fused with the vesicular membrane, and the beta cell membrane is concaved inside, which allowed for entry of REG I&#x3B1; vesicles into beta cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095110-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). The exocytotic pattern of zymogen granules of pancreatic acinar cells is &#x201C;sequential fusion&#x201D; exocytosis, in which multiple granules fuse together and are discharged through the prosome to the ductal lumen <xref rid="pone.0095110-Kasai1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0095110-Jena1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, while the excretion pattern of secretory vesicles of ATLANTIS is different, as mentioned above, suggesting the presence of unique cell-cell communication processes between the cells of ATLANTIS and islet cells. The processing, pathway and role of the vesicles containing REG I&#x3B1;, which were endocytosed into neighboring beta cells, remain speculative. In the endosome, the membrane covers the vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095110-g004">Figure 4D2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095110-g004">Figure 4E</xref>) and will keep an acidic and stable condition from pancreatic digestive enzymes that are derived from ATLANTIS cells. In the inflamed condition in FTIDM, the protein production of ATLANTIS cells is converted from the dual production of pancreatic digestive enzymes (e.g. amylase) and REG I&#x3B1; to dominant REG I&#x3B1; production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095110-g006">Figure 6D</xref>), which is probably related to pro-inflammatory cytokine stimulation as mentioned above. Coated-pit-like structures, which represent receptor-mediated endocytosis, were observed between ATLANTIS cells and islet endocrine cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095110-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The REG I&#x3B1; protein in endosomes may bind the corresponding receptor (i.e., EXTL3) <xref rid="pone.0095110-Kobayashi2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095110-VanHul1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and may mediate the signal for regeneration of the endocrine cells. Internal REG I&#x3B1; receptor(s) (i.e. EXTL3) may also mediate the signal <xref rid="pone.0095110-Parikh1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095110-Mueller1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. However, it is unclear how REG I&#x3B1; molecules delivered to endosome are transported across the endosome membrane into the cytoplasm. In non-diabetic conditions, in which beta cell regeneration by REG I&#x3B1; is not required, REG I&#x3B1;-containing vesicles may be processed in the lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0095110-g004">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>
      <p>The study of ATLANTIS will provide new insights to improve the survival rate of islet function after islet transplantation. A major emphasis in islet transplantation has been the purity of the islet preparation to promote engraftment and reduce immunogenicity <xref rid="pone.0095110-Agarwal1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. However, a few reports have suggested that islet purification may trigger apoptosis by removing important trophic factors responsible for maintenance and renewal of islet cell viability <xref rid="pone.0095110-Ilieva1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The present finding that REG I&#x3B1; proteins from ATLANTIS packed with islet cell clusters have a vital role in beta cell survival emphasize the need to keep the cell clusters isolated for islet transplantation.</p>
      <p>This study demonstrated that BMs and ECM encapsulating islet cell clusters and ATLANTIS were partly disrupted in FT1DM. BMs and ECM are a prerequisite for islet cell attachment and renewal in the non-diabetic state and act as barriers from immune attack in the pathological type 1 diabetes state <xref rid="pone.0095110-Korpos1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095110-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095110-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Importantly, disrupted microenvironments, especially capsules composed of BMs and ECM that maintain islet cell clusters and ATLANTIS, may impair beta cell replication in type 1 diabetes.</p>
