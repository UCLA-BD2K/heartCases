    <p>A 64-year-old man with dyslipidaemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus underwent percutaneous coronary intervention of the left anterior descending coronary artery because of post-infarct angina. After pre-dilatation, a 3.0/28 mm drug eluting stent was deployed (<italic>Panel A</italic>). A coronary segment was imaged using Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT; Terumo Corp. Tokyo, Japan) with a total flush volume of 16 mL (motorized pullback 20 mm/s, frame rate 160 fr/s). Intraluminal tissue with low attenuation and irregular surface, indicative of thrombus, was clearly visible in the mid-portion of the stent (<italic>Panel B</italic>). A malapposition was revealed at the proximal stent edge (<italic>Panel C</italic>). Based on these OCT findings, that were missed by angiography, the patient received a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, and a post-dilatation was performed using a 3.5 mm balloon at 18 atm. Subsequent angiography showed remarkable additional lumen gain. Intracoronary FD-OCT was able to demonstrate complete strut apposition over the whole stent length and resolution of the intraluminal thrombi (<italic>Panels E</italic> and <italic>F</italic>). Three-dimensional reconstruction of the OCT images (INTAGE Realia, KGT, Tokyo, Japan) allows the visualization of the rather complex anatomy of this stented segment in such a way that it is easily and fast comprehensible at a glance. Strut malapposition and intraluminal thrombus are clearly discernable, and their spatial relationship is well visualized (<italic>Panels G</italic> and <italic>H</italic>), as well as the impact of the therapeutic regimen (<italic>Panels I</italic> and <italic>J</italic>). The patient experienced no procedure-related complication and was discharged within 24 h after the procedure on dual antiplatelet therapy.</p>
    <p>Panels show coronary angiography, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and three dimensional OCT immediately after stenting (<italic>Panels A</italic>&#x2013;<italic>C</italic>, <italic>G</italic>, <italic>H</italic>) and after post dilatation (<italic>Panels D</italic>&#x2013;<italic>F</italic>, <italic>I</italic>, <italic>J</italic>). The yellow line indicates the stented segment. Asterisk and triangle indicate corresponding sites, respectively. Visual direction of virtual endoscopy (<italic>Panels H</italic>, <italic>J</italic>) is from proximal site to distal site. Dotted circle indicates intraluminal thrombus in stent. Bar = 1 mm.</p>
