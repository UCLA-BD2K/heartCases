          <p>Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is most commonly caused by mutations in the &#x3B2;-cell ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channel genes. Severe CHI was diagnosed in a 1-day-old girl; the mother&#x2019;s cousin and sister had a similar phenotype. <italic>ABCC8</italic> gene sequencing (leukocyte DNA) revealed a heterozygous, exon 37, six&#x2013;base pair in-frame insertion mutation in the affected patient and aunt but also in her unaffected mother and grandfather. In expression studies using transfected COSm6 cells, mutant sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) protein was expressed on the cell surface but failed to respond to MgADP even in the heterozygous state. mRNA expression in lymphocytes determined by sequencing cDNA clones and quantifying 6FAM-labeled PCR products found that although the healthy mother predominantly expressed the normal transcript, her affected daughter, carrying the same mutant allele, primarily transcribed the mutant. The methylation pattern of the imprinting control region of chromosome 11p15.5 and <italic>ABCC8</italic> promoter was similar for all family members. In conclusion, differences in transcript expression may determine the clinical phenotype of CHI in this maternally inherited dominant mutation. The use of peripheral lymphocytes as a peripheral window to the &#x3B2;-cell transcription profile can serve in resolving &#x3B2;-cell phenotypes. The severe, dominant-negative nature of the 1508insAS mutation suggests that it affects the functional stoichiometry of SUR1-regulated gating of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), characterized by dysregulated insulin secretion and hypoglycemia, is most commonly (40&#x2013;50%) caused by dysfunction of one of the two subunits of the pancreatic ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channel: the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) and the inward-rectifying potassium channel (Kir6.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Normally, K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, which are open in unstimulated &#x3B2;-cells, close as the ATP-to-ADP ratio increases, ultimately resulting in insulin exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p>
    <p>Histologically, CHI is either a diffuse disease in which all the pancreatic &#x3B2;-cells are affected or a focal disease in which only some of the &#x3B2;-cells are overactive. Biallelic, recessive germ line mutations in <italic>ABCC8</italic>, encoding SUR1, or in <italic>KCNJ11</italic>, encoding Kir6.2, lead to diffuse CHI, as do dominant mutations in these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Focal CHI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) is caused by a paternally inherited K<sub>ATP</sub> channel gene mutation and a subsequent somatic deletion in the maternal chromosome 11p15-ter in a &#x3B2;-cell precursor. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in this region, which includes the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel genes and imprinted loci involved in controlling cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), enables the precursor cell, expressing only mutant K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and paternally imprinted cell growth stimulating genes, to undergo clonal expansion and form the focal lesion.</p>
    <p>Here we describe a unique, maternally inherited dominant-negative mutation in <italic>ABCC8</italic> that causes CHI in some but not all family members carrying the mutation. By quantifying allele-specific <italic>ABCC8</italic> mRNA expression in lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), we demonstrate that relative mutated allele expression may predict the clinical phenotype and serve as a peripheral window to the &#x3B2;-cell expression profile.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 1-day-old female (III-2 [individuals are identified by Roman numerals indicating the generation and Arabic numerals indicating the specific individual]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>), born large for gestational age (4.8 kg) to nonconsanguineous Palestinian parents, developed severe hyperinsulinemic (10.1 mU/L) hypoglycemia (20 mg/dL) without ketonuria (ammonia and lactate were normal). After intravenous glucose infusion (20 mg/kg/min), gastric tube feeding and somatostatin analog (Octreotide; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) (dose 18 &#x3BC;g/kg/day) were necessary to achieve stable normoglycemia during 96 h of subcutaneous glucose monitoring (Minimed, Sylmar, CA) and thereafter. At age 2 years, she was gradually weaned off octreotide (&lt;5 &#x3BC;g/kg/day), but minimal continuous cornstarch intake was still required. The mother&#x2019;s sister (II-6) and paternal cousin (II-2) had similar, albeit milder, clinical presentations. Because a heterozygous six&#x2013;base pair (bp) in-frame insertion mutation in <italic>ABCC8</italic> exon 37 was found in the cousin (II-2) and her unaffected haploidentical brother (II-3) but not in their mother (I-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>), it was thought that patient II-2 had focal CHI as a result of paternal uniparental disomy or paternal mutation and LOH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Pancreatectomy was not clinically required, and the hypoglycemia resolved spontaneously.</p>

        <p>Inside-out patch-clamp recordings revealed that in contrast to the stimulatory effect seen in WT channels, the homozygote mutant channels and the simulated heterozygous channels completely lacked response to either MgADP or diazoxide, indicating a strong dominant-negative effect of the 1508insAS mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>).</p>

        <title>Quantitative analysis of mRNA transcripts.</title>
        <p>The strong dominant-negative effect of the mutant SUR1 predicted that all carriers should be severely symptomatic. However, four heterozygous individuals were clinically asymptomatic. To address this unexpected finding, we tested the possibility that the mutant transcript may not be expressed at the same level as the WT transcript in all patients. Lymphocyte-derived cDNAs from five symptomatic and asymptomatic family members were amplified for the fragment of the <italic>ABCC8</italic> gene flanking the mutation site (exon 37&#x2013;39). PCR products were cloned. Sequencing of &gt;20 clones from each individual showed that although the majority of the clones from the healthy mother (77%) and the healthy maternal grandfather (73%) carried the normal allele, the affected proband showed the opposite, with 66% of the clones being mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). It is interesting that the affected aunt, who had a milder clinical presentation (survived without significant medical therapy) and has been in remission for 10 years with no hypoglycemia, currently expressed 66% normal cDNA alleles. To confirm this finding, the lymphocyte-derived cDNAs were amplified with a 6FAM-labeled primer. Because the mutation is an insertion of six bp, it could be separated by high-resolution sequencing gel electrophoresis. In three independent samples, withdrawn at 12, 18, and 24 months of age (while clinical improvement was taking place), the affected subject predominantly expressed the mutant mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). In contrast, her unaffected mother showed high relative expression of normal mRNA compared with the mutant mRNA. The aunt with the milder disease, and currently in clinical remission, showed an intermediate expression pattern, similar to the previous cloning studies. The father, who does not carry the mutation, expressed only normal mRNA as expected.</p>

        <p>To exclude the possibility of an intronic or promoter mutation affecting expression of the paternally inherited allele, we amplified exon 12 of the parental and patient cDNA, which includes a heterozygous MaeII restriction enzyme polymorphic site. MaeII digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>) showed that the father transcribes both alleles at comparable levels. The patient and mother preferentially express one opposing allele (38 and 64%, respectively), confirming the findings of differential expression of the mutation itself.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The unusual finding of a severe, autosomal-dominant <italic>ABCC8</italic> mutation causing CHI in only 50% of the carriers suggested that variable mutant allele expression may determine the disease phenotype. Mutations in the <italic>ABCC8</italic> gene are responsible for 40&#x2013;50% of CHI cases, focal or diffuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Previous studies of dominant SUR1 mutations show that mutant channels were expressed on the cell surface, but their response to MgADP was defective; in the heterozygous state, channels had intermediate responses to MgADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The mutated protein found in our family, with its predicted two amino acid insertion, is expressed on the cell surface, but the channel does not open in response to MgADP or diazoxide even in the heterozygous state. Thus, to our knowledge, the 1508insAS mutation is the first CHI mutation exhibiting a nearly complete dominant-negative gating effect. Because the 1510&#x2013;11 AlaSer residues lie in the interface of the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), duplication of these two residues may disrupt interactions between the NBDs and affect the octameric channel complex during MgADP stimulation.</p>
      <p>Initially, the mother&#x2019;s cousin was thought to have focal CHI because only one mutation was found and her haploidentical brother was asymptomatic. In a similar manner, the clinical findings in the aunt, with a paternally inherited mutation, were also consistent with focal CHI. In contrast, our proband, with severe CHI, inherited her mutated allele from her mother, which is not consistent with the two-hit mechanism proposed to cause focal CHI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Furthermore, three case subjects with focal CHI, usually described as a rare, sporadic event in one family, seemed extremely unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p>
      <p>We hypothesized that the marked phenotypic variability in mutation-carrying family members was related to the relative expression of the mutant allele. Lymphoblastic mRNA was previously used to study the ratio between <italic>HNF1A</italic> mRNA levels and the risk of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>); however, lymphoblast cell lines tend to clonalyze over time, limiting their use in predicting human pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Because no pancreatic tissue was available, and given the limitations of lymphoblast-derived studies, we amplified <italic>ABCC8</italic> cDNA fragments derived from lymphocytic <italic>ABCC8</italic> mRNA.</p>
      <p>Although our patient consistently expressed mostly the mutant allele in independent mRNA samples, her asymptomatic mother and grandfather primarily expressed the normal transcript. Of interest, the more mildly affected aunt (II-6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), currently in long remission, had an intermediate expression pattern, suggesting that differential expression of mutated and WT alleles may correlate with disease severity. Given the severe dominant-negative nature of this mutation, the hetero-octameric channel structure and the assumption that mutant and normal SUR1 protein are randomly recruited into the channels, dysfunction is already expected when one of the four SUR1 molecules is mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). This means that if both the mutant and the normal transcript are equally expressed, the chance of having all four subunits made from the normal transcript is only one-sixteenth (6%). Therefore, if 70% (the normal mother) of the expressed transcript is normal, &#x223C;25% of the channels are expected to function normally, enabling normal &#x3B2;-cell function. In marked contrast, if only 30% (our patient) of the transcripts are normal, then only &#x223C;1% of the channels are expected to be normal, abolishing &#x3B2;-cell function. The intermediate expression of the mutant allele in patient II-6 also raises the intriguing possibility that the relative expression of the mutant allele may change over time, thus explaining the clinical remission seen in this patient and in patient II-2. Prospective studies are needed to fully address this question.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to understand the mechanism causing interindividual variability in allele expression, we studied two possible epigenetic etiologies. Although <italic>ABCC8</italic> gene&#x2019;s promoter is known to be a CpG island and, thus, not expected to be regulated by methylation, given its de novo methylation in colon cancer (H. Cedar, unpublished observations), we tested its methylation pattern and that of the adjacent 11p15 ICR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). Although LOH is thought to be a somatic event restricted to the pancreatic lesion, systemic aberrant methylation of the short arm of chromosome 11 is seen in Wilms tumor and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). However, no difference in methylation pattern, either in chromosome 11p15 (ICR) or in the <italic>ABCC8</italic> promoter region, was apparent in any of the family members tested.</p>
      <p>Another possibility was that the mutation, located 15 bp from the 37 exon splice donor site, could be variably affected by splice-regulating factors and result in variable splicing and phenotype, as described for cystic fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Splice prediction programs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sroogle/tau/ac/il">http://sroogle/tau/ac/il</ext-link> and RESearch) failed to predict any effect on splicing efficiency by the 1508insAS mutation.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that variability in transcript expression may determine the clinical phenotype of CHI. A mechanism that regulates the transcript expression of a mutant allele may protect from or enable a severe phenotype in subjects with the same genotype. It is important that the use of peripheral lymphocytes as a window to the &#x3B2;-cell transcription profile may help explain other unexpected &#x3B2;-cell phenotypes. It may be especially significant given the epigenetic regulation at the telomeric end of chromosome 11p, where several genes of glucose metabolism are encoded. Finally, the unique severe dominant-negative nature of the 1508insAS mutation may provide new insight into the structure-functional relationship of the SUR1 NBD regions on channel gating.</p>
