      <abstract>
        <p>Psychiatric symptoms have been reported quite frequently in 
certain thyroid diseases, but more frequently in association 
with hypothyroidism. Thyrotoxicosis can be associated with 
various psychiatric symptoms, such as emotional lability, 
anxiety, restlessness and rarely frank psychosis. Psychotic symptoms 
in the context of hyperthyroidism typically present as an 
affective psychosis. The link between psychosis and hyperthyroidism 
is poorly understood. Because of this association of psychiatric 
symptoms is important to exclude a somatic cause, when assessing a 
patient first.</p>
        <p>We present the case of young woman who was followed over 2 years 
and who initially presented to psychiatric consultation for 
depressive symptoms, after being diagnosed with hyperthyroidism 
and specific therapy instituted, but who developed psychotic symptoms.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hyperthyroidism is frequently associated with: irritability, 
insomnia, anxiety, restlessness, fatigue, impairment in concentrating 
and memory, these symptoms can be episodic or may develop into 
mania, depression and delirium. In some cases motor inhibition and 
apathy are symptoms that accompany hyperthyroidism.</p>
      <p>Psychosis is a rare complication in hyperthyroidism, it was reported 
in 1% of cases and most patients who develop psychosis have 
been previously diagnosed with mania and/or delirium 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The fact that certain 
psychotic symptoms can be found in patient with hyperthyroidism, which 
was in its specific treatment for the disease raises both diagnostic 
and therapeutic problems and collaboration between specialists 
is necessary to clarify the cause of symptoms and to establish 
an appropriate treatment as soon as possible.</p>

      <title>Case presentation</title>
      <p>We present a case of a female patient (38 years old), 
without psychiatric history who was observed over 2 
years (2007&#x2013;2009). Patient is nonsmoker, no drugs abuse and 
there is no family history of psychiatric disorders.</p>
      <p><bold><italic>May 2007</italic></bold>: the patient presents to 
the psychiatric ambulatory for depressive symptoms (depressed mood, 
crying easily, depressive thought of hopelessness, drop out of 
social activities, slowed thinking, speech and body movements, 
fatigue) with no clinical or biological sign for a somatic disease. It 
was established diagnosis of major depressive episode for which 
was instituted treatment with Fluoxetine 20mg per day. The treatment 
was followed for 2 month without a significant improvement of symptoms.
</p>
      <p><bold><italic>July 2007</italic></bold>: patient shall be submitted 
for review therapy; when examining patient had: depressed mood, 
crying easily, tremor, palpitations, minor exophthalmos, weight loss of 
3 kilograms. The dose of Fluoxetine was increase to 40 mg per day. In 
this context was require endocrine evaluation. Blood analysis 
was performed with the following results: blood count and 
leukocyte formula in normal ranges, glucose in normal range, hepatic 
tests normal, normal urine sediment. The result of thyroidian tests 
was: T3= 500ng/dl (normal parameters between 70&#x2013;210ng/dl), 
FT4= 20ng/dl (normal parameters between 0.7&#x2013;2ng/dl) 
and TSH=0.01microU/ml (normal parameters between 0.3&#x2013;
6.2microU/ml). After an evaluation is established diagnosis 
of hyperthyroidism and establish treatment with Propiltiouracil 600mg 
per day Treatment was maintained 3 months.</p>
      <p>In <bold><italic>October</italic></bold> the patient is brought to 
the psychiatric emergency room for a delirious hallucinatory 
symptoms (extraordinary irritability, visual and auditory 
hallucinations, delusions of persecution and pursuit, 
psychomotor agitation, stereotype behaviour). Somatic examination 
found: marked bilateral exophthalmos, hyperhidrosis, tremor 
of extremities, goiter, tachycardia, vomiting.</p>
      <p>At this point we decided to interrupt antidepressant treatment and 
to maintain therapy with Propiltiouracil 600mg per day. The result 
of thyroidian tests was: T3= 800ng/dl (normal parameters 
between 70&#x2013;210ng/dl), FT4= 27ng/dl (normal parameters 
between 0.7&#x2013;l2ng/dl) and TSH=0.002microU/ml (normal 
parameters between 0.3&#x2013;6.2microU/ml). With all this, the 
diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis is suspected. The term of 
thyrotoxicosis refers to clinical, psysiological and 
biochemical manifestations that occur after exposure and response of 
the tissues to the excessive supply of thyroid hormone 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. It was established the 
diagnose of acute psychotic episode with symptoms of schizophrenia 
and patient received treatment with Risperidone 4mg per day. After 6 
weeks delirious hallucinatory symptoms were resolved 
incomplete (hallucinations disappeared and the patient began 
to communicate verbally, but unstable delusions still 
remain). Interdisciplinary consultation recommended thyroid excision 
as therapeutic approach. The patient was prepared psychologically for 
the accomplishment of total thyroidectomy with full acceptance (it 
was maintained treatment with risperidone 4 mg per day).</p>
      <p><bold><italic>January 2008</italic></bold>: thyroidectomy was 
performed and establish replacement therapy with levothyroxine (
125microg per day). Within 3 months thyroid tests were normalized and 
was dropped antipsychotic treatment (the dose was gradually reduced 
to that with normalization of thyroid tests to give to 
antipsychotic treatment).</p>
      <p>Psychiatric reassessment has highlighted the temporal 
correlation between psychotic symptoms and decompensation of 
thyroidian status. Final psychiatric diagnosis was that the 
psychotic episode due to general medical condition (thyrotoxicosis).</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Thyroid disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of 
a large spectrum of psychiatric symptoms; early treatment of the 
hormone or metabolic alteration can minimize the morbidity of a 
secondary psychopathology. In addition, in most of the patients, it 
is enough to correct the psychiatric symptoms, although, in a subgroup 
of them, the resolution of some pictures, such as depression, may 
not occur after the treatment of the endocrine or metabolic 
dysfunction and may require specific psychiatric treatment. Even 
so, psychiatric symptoms can dynamically changed into a 
veritable psychosis and antipsychotic agents may be necessary to 
control the hallucinatory delirious symptoms 
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Our case became more 
difficult because of  initial endocrine and psychiatric treatment 
failure which led to a radical solution: thyroidectomy. The benefit 
of this approach was immediately observed with full control of 
both conditions.</p>
