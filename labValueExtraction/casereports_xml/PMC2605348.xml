      <abstract>
        <p>We describe a mutation in human erythrocyte band 3 (anion exchanger 1; <italic>SLC4A1</italic>) causing both hereditary spherocytosis and distal renal tubular acidosis. The proband developed a transfusion-dependent, hemolytic anemia following birth. Immunoblotting showed band 3 was reduced to approximately 35% of wildtype; other proteins of the band 3/Rh macrocomplex were also reduced. DNA sequence analysis revealed a novel homozygous mutation, c.2000C&gt;T, leading to the amino acid substitution Ser667Phe. The parents were heterozygous for the same mutation. Sulfate influx in the patient's erythrocytes was approximately 40% wild type. The mutant band 3 produced very little chloride influx when expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Influx was partially rescued by coexpression of glycophorin A and also rescued by coexpression of wild-type band 3. At 2 years of age, an ammonium chloride challenge showed the child has incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA). Stable expression of mutant kidney band 3 in both nonpolarized and polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells showed that most of the mutant protein was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Overall our results suggest that the Ser667Phe does not affect the anion transport function of band 3, but causes a trafficking defect in both erythrocytes and kidney cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Band 3 (anion exchanger 1; <italic>SLC4A1</italic>) carries out chloride/bicarbonate exchange transport in both erythrocytes and the acid-secreting cells in the kidney.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In erythrocytes, band 3 is intimately involved in gas transport and also in the maintenance of erythrocyte stability and morphology. In kidney cells, the action of band 3 allows the excretion of acid into the urine. The kidney isoform of band 3 is truncated and lacks the first 65 amino acids of erythroid band 3. Heterozygous mutations in the <italic>SLC4A1</italic> gene are one of the most frequent causes of hereditary spherocytosis (HS).<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> These mutations generally affect the stability of band 3; erythrocyte band 3 is reduced by 20% to 30%, giving a mild clinical presentation. Not uncommonly, the condition is discovered in adulthood. Normally these heterozygous <italic>SLC4A1</italic> HS mutations are not associated with kidney disease, presumably because sufficient wild-type band 3 is expressed in the kidney to allow acid secretion. There have been a number of <italic>SLC4A1</italic> mutations reported that result in a defect in the ability of the kidney to secrete acid, and cause distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA).<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> These mutations generally affect the trafficking of band 3 in kidney cells,<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> but do not often affect erythrocyte band 3 expression. Trafficking of erythroid band 3 differs from kidney band 3, and depends on glycophorin A (GPA), which is not expressed in kidney cells</p>
      <p>Homozygous <italic>SLC4A1</italic> mutations, associated with HS, are normally lethal in humans. This is because the lack of band 3 causes the erythrocytes to be extremely unstable, leading to uncontrolled hemolytic anemia, but also because kidney function is severely impaired. Mice with targeted disruption of the <italic>slc4a1</italic> gene have been obtained and show these defects.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In humans, homozygosity for a band 3 mutation causing HS was first described through band 3 Coimbra (Val488Met).<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> This child was born severely anemic and hydropic, had severe HS and dRTA with nephrocalcinosis, and had to be maintained on regular blood transfusions and daily bicarbonate. The mechanism by which the mutant band 3 failed to access or remain in the membrane, either in the erythrocytes or in the &#x3B1;-intercalated cells, was not elucidated, although a recent report shows that the Val488Met band 3 mutant is retained intracellularly when expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The second case, known as band 3 Neapolis, resulted from the homozygous inheritance of a T-to-C substitution at the +2 position in the donor splice site of intron 2.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The child had severe HS but reportedly no dRTA because the mutation affects exon 2, which is not expressed in kidney band 3.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we describe the second patient with a homozygous <italic>SLC4A1</italic> mutation (Ser667Phe) causing both HS and dRTA. This band 3 variant differs from the previous variant<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> in that a significant amount of band 3 reached the erythrocyte membrane and the dRTA was incomplete.</p>

        <p>The male proband was born in May 2004. He is the firstborn of an Algerian couple originating from Kabylia. The parents are first cousins. The pregnancy was uneventful. The neonate had normal weight (3.05 Kg), size (47 cm), and skull perimeter (34 cm), and an Agpar of 8 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. At birth, the erythrocyte hemoglobin (Hb) was 139 g/L (13.9 g/dL). The baby was discharged with an iron and folic acid treatment. At day 11, the baby showed a pronounced pallor. Red cell indices were as follows: Hb, 38 g/L (3.8 g/dL); red blood cells (RBCs), 0.94 &#xD7; 10<sup>12</sup>/L; reticulocytes, 162 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L, 17.2%; mean corpuscular volume (MCV), 100.6 fL; and mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), 359 g/L (35.9 g/dL). A first transfusion was given. Subtotal splenectomy was carried out at 9 months of age after 11 transfusions and cancelled the need for transfusions. In addition to spherocytosis, an acidosis was noticed, which partially receded after a few months. Bicarbonate was prescribed for a month but was discontinued. Urinary pH was not measured on a regular basis, but proved to be usually below 7.00. Renal sonographies performed at 10 and 22 months of age showed no signs of nephrocalcinosis. At 2 years of age, an ammonium chloride challenge suggested that the child has incomplete dRTA; in the 7 hours of the test, the blood bicarbonates decreased to 15.6 mM, but urinary pH remained above 5.90.</p>
        <p>The parents were unaware of carrying hereditary spherocytosis. They showed a compensated hemolysis, increased percentage of hyperdense cells, spherocytosis on blood smears, and a typical curve of HS upon osmotic gradient ektacytometry<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

The patient's erythrocytes serotyped as Rh phenotype R1R1, and 2 R1R1 controls were used for the SDS-PAGE so that direct comparison of the amount of Rh proteins was possible. The amount of band 3 present in the patient's erythrocytes was about 35% of the 2 wild-type controls; protein 4.2 was similarly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A; Coomassie-stained gel and immunoblots). GPA was reduced to about 60% normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). This reduction is most obvious in the dimer (A<sub>2</sub>) and heterodimer (AB) forms of GPA, whose formation in SDS is dependent on the amount of monomeric GPA present.

DIDS binds to band 3 on a 1:1 basis with extremely high affinity, and hence the titration plots as a straight line, with the point at which the line crosses the y-axis giving the relative amount of sulfate influx and the point at which the line crosses the x-axis giving the number of DIDS-binding sites, which is equivalent to the number of band 3 molecules in the sample. The relative amount of sulfate influx and the number of DIDS-binding sites in the patient's erythrocytes were 39% and 44%, respectively, compared with the control. The relative amount of sulfate influx and the number of DIDS-binding sites in the mother's erythrocytes were both 95% compared with the control. As the amount of band 3 present in the patients erythrocytes was about 35% that of the controls (see &#x201C;Erythrocyte membrane protein analysis&#x201D;), this result suggests that the anion transport activity of the mutant protein is normal.</p>

As expected, oocytes expressing wild-type B3 or kB3 had substantial DNDS (4,4&#x2032;-dinitro-2,2&#x2032;-stilbene-disulfonic acid) sensitive anion transport, which was increased by coexpression of GPA.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Both S667F-B3 and S667F-kB3 consistently gave very low levels of chloride influx that was not significantly above that of the uninjected control oocytes.

DNDS-sensitive chloride influx (1 hour) was measured 24 hours after injection with the cRNA using groups of 12 to 15 oocytes. Results are shown as means plus or minus SEM. Significance level is for comparisons of influx between B3 and S667F-B3, or B3 plus GPA and S667F-B3 plus GPA, or kB3 and S667F-kB3, or kB3 plus GPA and S667F-kB3 plus GPA (sample by Student <italic>t</italic> test; ***<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). For the chymotrypsin assay and the biotinylation assay, oocytes were injected with 5 ng of B3 or S667F-B3 and 1.5 ng of GPA and allowed to express protein for 24 hours. The oocytes were then subjected to a chymotrypsin assay or biotinylated as outlined in &#x201C;Cell-surface protease assay and biotinylation of oocytes.&#x201D; (A) S667F-B3 has very little chloride influx when expressed alone in oocytes, and this is incompletely rescued by coexpression of GPA in both S667F-B3 and S667F-kB3 to approximately 50% of wild-type B3 + GPA or kB3 + GPA. (B) Comparison of the effects of coexpression of 0.015 to 1.5 ng GPA cRNA on normal B3 and S667F-B3 chloride influx. Although GPA dose-dependently increased wild-type chloride influx, the enhancement effect of GPA was observed to be maximal at 0.15 ng with S667F-B3 (representative of 3 independent experiments) and was saturated. (C,D) Representative chymotrypsin and biotinylation blots after 24 hours' expression using anti&#x2013;band 3 C-terminal antibody BRIC155 to detect B3. The chymotrypsin gel was loaded with 10 oocytes per lane and is representative of 2 separate experiments conducted in duplicate. The biotinylation assay used material from 3 immunoprecipitations (10 oocytes per IP), and the biotinylated fraction from this pooled material was isolated using strepavidin beads (representative of 2 separate experiments). One-twentieth of the input from the 3 IPs is also shown. Both methods confirm that GPA increases the level of wild-type B3 at the cell surface as previously reported, but only a small amount of S667F-B3 is detected at the cell surface; this does not appear to increase upon coexpression with GPA under the conditions used. (E) Effects of coexpression of 0.75 ng normal B3 with 0.75 ng S667F-B3 on chloride influx. Results are expressed as percentages of the chloride influx obtained with normal B3 and are shown as means plus or minus SEM. The predicted amount of activity is also shown, which represents the expected contribution of 50% B3 and 50% S667F-B3 chloride influx assuming that each population is independent. This result shows that coexpression of wild-type B3 with S667F-B3 rescues the chloride influx of S667F-B3 beyond the predicted level (representative of 4 independent experiments).</p>

          <p>To investigate how little GPA cRNA was required to significantly increase the level of S667F-B3 DNDS-sensitive anion transport, oocytes were injected with a constant amount of band 3 cRNA (1.5 ng/oocyte) together with GPA cRNA concentrations ranging from 0.015 ng to 1.5 ng (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Coexpression of increasing amounts of GPA cRNA linearly increased the chloride influx of wild-type band 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). However, the rescue effect of GPA on the mutant S667F-B3 chloride influx was observed at the lowest levels of GPA cRNA coinjected (0.015 ng), and coexpression of increasing amounts of GPA cRNA (greater than 0.015 ng) did not significantly improve on this influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B).</p>
          <p>To investigate whether coexpression of GPA increased the expression of the S667F-B3 at the oocyte membrane, we assessed the surface expression of S667F-B3 by chymotrypsin cleavage and biotinylation. Band 3 possesses a single extracellular chymotrypsin cleavage site between transmembrane spans 5 and 6, which can be used to assay the proportion of band 3 at the oocyte membrane.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> After protease treatment, intracellular band 3 remains intact, whereas surface-expressed band 3 can be detected as a 35-kDa C-terminal fragment using Western blotting.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Coexpression of band 3 with GPA increased the amount of wild-type band 3 protein at the cell surface as expected<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). There was very little S667F-B3 expressed at the surface in the absence of GPA, and coexpression with GPA did not enhance this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). Biotinylation studies gave a similar result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). Thus, since there was no obvious enhancement of S667F-B3 protein expression to the surface under these conditions, this suggests that the majority of the observed rescue of chloride influx seen on coexpression with GPA results from enhanced activity of the mutant protein already at the surface. Interestingly, S667F-B3 protein levels were further reduced in oocytes incubated for 48 hours, suggesting that the mutant protein is degraded (results not shown). Pulse-chase experiments in MDCK1 cells also show rapid degradation of the mutant protein (Figure S3).</p>

          <p>We next investigated whether coexpression of wild-type B3 could influence the expression/anion transport of S667F-B3. If the DNDS-sensitive anion transport achieved was proportional to the separate activities of the 2 proteins, then we anticipated that we would observe combined anion transport equivalent to 50:50 of wild-type and mutant band 3 activity. To mimic the normal, homozygous, and heterozygous situations, oocytes were injected with B3 (1.5 ng) alone, S667F-B3 (1.5 ng) alone, or B3 (0.75 ng) and S667F-B3 (0.75 ng) combined, and chloride influx was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E). DNDS-sensitive chloride influx in oocytes coexpressing B3 and S667F-B3 consistently ranged between 70% to 90% of normal (mean, 79.7% &#xB1; 3.8%; n = 7) compared with the predicted 55% activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E). This effect was unexpected, as generally coexpression of wild-type band 3 with other band 3 mutants results in anion transport equivalent to approx 50:50 that of the mutant and wild-type activities<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (Figure S4).</p>
          <p>We tried to use biotinylation to measure the surface expression of S667F-B3 in the presence of wild-type pro tein using a combination of S667F-B3 and WT-kB3 in order to get a detectable size differential between the 2 proteins. It was not possible to discern any obvious difference between the levels of S667F-B3 protein when expressed alone and when the mutant protein was coexpressed with normal protein (Figure S5). However, where WT-kB3 and S667F-B3 were coexpressed, both proteins were expressed to the surface at similar levels (Figure S5), consistent with the idea that both mutant and wild-type protein equally contribute to the increase in chloride influx observed when the 2 proteins are coexpressed.</p>

        <p>We successfully isolated stable clones expressing S667F-kB3, but only a small proportion of these cells contained detectable amounts of S667F-kB3 as determined by confocal microscopy using a variety of band 3 antibodies. Where detected, the majority of S667F-kB3 was localized to an intracellular compartment reminiscent of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D,J). This localization was also seen in MDCK1 cells transiently transfected with S667F-kB3 (results not shown). Double antibody staining using the monoclonal antibody BRIC170 in combination with an antibody to the ER marker calnexin confirmed that the majority of the S667F-kB3 immunolocalized protein overlaps substantially with the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>F, S6). However, unlike other band 3 mutants that are exclusively trapped in the ER, such as Arg589His and Ser613Phe,<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> S667F-kB3 immunostaining colocalized with the TGN marker TGN38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>L), suggesting that some mutant protein is able to escape the ER and reach the later stages of the secretory pathway. Therefore, we used an extracellular band 3 antibody FITC-BRIC6 (which recognizes the third extracellular loop of band 3) to detect any kidney band 3 protein at the surface. All cells expressing wild-type kidney band 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>M) were labeled with substantial amount of FITC-BRIC6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>N). All cells expressing mutant kidney band 3, detected with the &#x3B1;rbB3Ct antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>O), also bound a very small amount of FITC-BRIC6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>P), suggesting that a small proportion of S667F-kB3 is able escape the ER and to reach the cell surface. Double-staining MDCK1-S667F-kB3 cells with both BRIC170 and &#x3B1;rbB3Ct showed that the cells expressing low levels of S667F-kB3 are not detected by &#x3B1;rbB3Ct (Figure S1). Therefore, it is the cells expressing higher levels of S667F-kB3 (visible using &#x3B1;rbB3Ct antibody) that show small amounts of mutant protein at the cell surface.</p>
        <p>We also examined the localization of S667F-kB3 in polarized MDCK1 cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A shows polarized MDCK1 cells expressing wild-type kB3 or S667F-kB3 double-labeled with the BRIC170 antibody and a rabbit antibody to calnexin.

Polarized MDCK1 cells expressing kB3 or S667F-kB3 were also double-labeled with BRIC170 and the basolateral marker &#x3B2;-catenin. Wild-type kB3 clearly colocalizes with the basolateral marker, but no such colocalization was observed with S667F-kB3 (Figure S7). To investigate whether S667F-kB3 reaches the surface in polarized cells, kB3-and S667F-kB3&#x2013;expressing cells were incubated with FITC-BRIC6. Although kB3 was detectable at the basolateral membrane, no S667F-kB3 was detectable for the MDCK1-S667F-kB3&#x2013;expressing cells, probably due to the lower protein expression seen when MDCK1 cells are polarized<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> (results not shown).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>A previous study on band 3 Coimbra red cells suggested the existence of a band 3/Rh macrocomplex that may function to facilitate more efficient gas exchange in the erythrocyte.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Evidence for the macrocomplex was based on the observation that loss of band 3 expression caused the equivalent loss of a number of other proteins, including proteins of the Rh complex.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In band 3 Courcouronnes erythrocytes, band 3 is reduced to about 35% of normal. Protein 4.2 is likewise reduced, but proteins of the Rh complex (RhAG, Rh polypeptides, CD47) are present at about 60% of normal. The band 3/Rh macrocomplex is thought to form around the tetrameric form of band 3, and the stoichiometry (in normal cells) suggests that all the Rh proteins associate with the macrocomplex. If the oligomeric ratio of band 3 in Courcouronnes red cells is maintained at 60:40, dimer to tetramer, then the Rh complex proteins should be present at about 14% of normal. The fact that the Rh complex proteins are present at about 60% of normal suggests that when the amount of band 3 is limited, tetrameric band 3 may form preferentially, perhaps in order to fill the normal amount of ankyrin-binding sites found in band 3 Courcouronnes erythrocytes.</p>

        <title>Association with GPA is altered or S667F-B3 is degraded before association with GPA can occur</title>
        <p>S667F-B3 was only partially rescued by the presence of GPA in erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) or oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A), suggesting that the interaction of S667F-B3 with GPA is altered. Various studies locate the GPA interaction with either TM8 or TM9 of band 3, or with the C-terminal domain.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x2013;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Ser667 lies in putative TM8 of band 3 and is a Ser, Ala, or Cys in all band 3 homologs. The Ser667Phe mutation introduces a bulky, hydrophobic side chain that may sterically affect or destabilize the association of GPA with band 3, reducing the ability of GPA to interact with, and therefore rescue, the majority of S667F-B3 before it is turned over by cellular protein quality control mechanisms. Furthermore, previous work has shown that the N- and C-terminal regions of GPA contribute to the enhancement effects of GPA seen on B3 activity and translocation, respectively.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Since GPA enhanced the activity of S667F but not its expression level at the surface in oocytes, this may be an indication of an altered interaction of S667F-B3 and the C-terminal tail region of GPA.</p>
        <p>However, if the Ser667Phe mutation simply affected the affinity of the mutant band 3 for GPA, then a titration of GPA with S667F-B3 would be expected to show a linear relationship. Instead, we found that the ability of GPA to rescue S667F-B3 becomes saturated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Our studies have shown that the majority of S667F-kB3 is located in the ER and is core glycosylated, indicating that the bulk of the mutant protein has not reached the Golgi. In contrast, the dRTA G701D-kB3 mutant, which like S667F-B3 does not reach the plasma membrane of oocytes, is localized to the TGN at steady state and is complex glycosylated<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> (A.M.T., unpublished observations, July 2, 2007). G701D-B3 is almost completely rescued by GPA in both oocytes and erythrocytes,<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> whereas S667F-B3 is only partially rescued by GPA. Together, these results suggest that the interaction between band 3 and GPA occurs in the late secretory pathway (TGN) and that S667F-B3 may be turned over by the protein quality control mechanisms before it can interact with GPA.</p>

        <title>Coexpression of wild-type band 3 rescues band 3 Courcouronnes</title>
        <p>Band 3 Courcouronnes is expressed, and functional, in the heterozygous parents, suggesting that the trafficking defect in these cells is compensated in some way. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, the chloride influx of S667F-B3 is substantially rescued by coexpression of wild-type B3, suggesting that the mutant protein forms fully functional heterodimers with wild-type protein. Heterodimerisation of S667F-B3 with wild-type B3 probably occurs in the ER on formation of the nascent protein and may induce the correct folding of the mutant protein, or the association may provide the required trafficking signals or interaction sites for accessory proteins necessary for ER exit, which may be occluded in the S667F-B3 mutant homodimer.<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> It is interesting to speculate that wild-type rescue could be a common compensatory mechanism in band 3&#x2013;induced HS. It would explain the 20% to 30% reduction in band 3, and mild phenotype, in individuals with HS caused by heterozygous band 3 mutations.</p>

        <title>Homozygous S667F-kB3 causes incomplete dRTA</title>
        <p>Recent in vitro studies in polarized MDCK cells suggest that dRTA mutations cause kB3 to be retained intracellularly or mistargeted to the apical membrane.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> This has been corroborated in renal biopsy tissue from one patient with the S613F mutation who had cytosolic staining.<sup><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Retention of the majority of S667F-kB3 in the ER would explain the observed dRTA in the homozygous patient. The fact that small amounts of S667F-kB3 can reach the plasma membrane in MDCK1 cells that overexpress S667F-kB3 may explain why this patient has a mild form or incomplete dRTA (especially if we consider that acidosis is known to up-regulate band 3 RNA and protein levels in the rabbit kidney<sup><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that there may be some unknown compensating mechanism.</p>
        <p>In summary, this study describes a novel homozygous <italic>SLC4A1</italic> mutation (Ser667Phe) that results in HS and dRTA. This is only the second case of combined HS and dRTA to be reported. The study provides further evidence to support the hypothesis that a site of interaction between band 3 and GPA involves TM8. It also provides evidence that the formation of heterodimers between B3 mutant proteins and wild-type protein can correct mistrafficking, explaining the mild clinical presentation in some individuals heterozygous with HS. The Ser667Phe mutant will be a useful tool for further investigating the trafficking of band 3 and its interactions with GPA.</p>
