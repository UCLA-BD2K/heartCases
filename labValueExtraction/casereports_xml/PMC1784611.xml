        <p>BACKGROUND: It is the purpose of this article to describe a suspected association of inadvertent vaccination with varicella vaccine during early pregnancy with the subsequent development of in utero miliary fetal tissue calcifications and fetal hydrops detected by sonogram at 15 weeks of gestation. CASE: This is a case presentation of a pregnant patient who received varicella vaccination during the same menstrual cycle that she became pregnant, and is supplemented by a literary review. The fetus developed miliary fetal tissue calcifications and fetal hydrops detected by a targeted sonogram at 15 weeks gestation. CONCLUSION: Varicella vaccination during early pregnancy may be a cause of miliary fetal tissue calcifications and fetal hydrops.</p>
