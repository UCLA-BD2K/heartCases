    <p>Sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) is a well-known cause of chronic
granulomatous uveitis. Neovascularization of the disc (NVD)
may occur in such chronic uveitis, however, it has not been
reported in SO to the best of our knowledge. Neovascularization
of the disc in this case was also of a recurrent nature.</p>
    <sec sec-type="">
      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>A 25-year-old female patient presented with 2 months history of
gradual painless progressive diminution of vision accompanied
by floaters in the left eye. She had been treated with systemic
and topical steroids with a presumptive diagnosis of pan
uveitis with disc edema at a primary health care center and
was referred. Her history revealed that 8 months earlier she
had undergone right eye parsplana lensectomy and vitrectomy
(PPL + PPV) with intravitreal antibiotics at a different center,
for suspected metastatic endophthalmitis secondary to post
partum abscess. Culture reports were, however, not available.
There was no visual improvement following surgery and she
had developed phthisical changes.</p>
      <p>On examination best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was
no light perception in right eye while left eye had counting
fingers (CF) close to face with accurate light projection. In
the left eye apart from fine keratic precipitates, a 3+ cellular
reaction was noted in both the anterior chamber (AC) and
vitreous. Lens and intraocular pressure were normal. Fundus
examination showed the presence of hyperemic disc with
blurred disc margins and tortuous dilated vessels [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1A">Fig. 1A</xref>]. It
was associated with serous retinal detachment with shifting
fluid. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) showed multiple
tiny pinhead-sized hyperfluorescent spots in the superior half
of the retina [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1C">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1D">D</xref>] with an inferior serous retinal
detachment. Late phase showed disc hyperfluorescence with
blurring of margins [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1B">Fig. 1B</xref>]. Systemic examination was normal
which included hearing tests and dermatological examination.
A clinical diagnosis of SO was made and intravenous pulse
steroids (Dexamethasone 100 mg in 150 ml of 5% dextrose)
for three days along with topical steroids and cycloplegics
were started. Visual acuity improved to 13/200 on day four.
Patient was continued on once daily oral steroids at 1 mg/kg
body weight. However, 2 weeks after therapy patient started
to develop side-effects to steroids and hence methotrexate
15 mg/week and folic acid 5 mg were added while steroid dose
was reduced gradually by 10 mg/week.</p>
      <p>Six weeks after starting methotrexate, cellular reaction
reduced to 1+ in vitreous and no cells in AC with complete
resolution of retinal detachment and the BCVA was 20/60.
Patient was continued on these medications and was put on a
monthly follow-up with close monitoring of the blood counts
and liver function. After 14 weeks of starting methotrexate,
patient was noted to have developed abnormal fine branching
vessels on the disc suggestive of neovascularization and
this was confirmed on the FFA [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2A">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2B">B</xref>]. Vitreous
examination revealed 1+ cell, however, there was no activity in
the AC. Patient was treated with pan retinal photocoagulation
(PRP) and a posterior subtenon (PST) injection 0.5 ml of
40 mg/ml triamcinalone acetonide while methotrexate was
continued. Three months after the PRP, the vessels appeared
to have regressed clinically as well as on FFA compared to the
initial presentation [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2C">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2D">D</xref>].</p>
      <p>Two months later the patient presented with diminution of
vision. On examination her BCVA was 10/200, which rapidly
deteriorated to CF close to face in two days. There was no
activity in the anterior segment while there were 2+ cells in the
vitreous. Fundus examination revealed recurrence of NVD and
multifocal serous detachments involving the macula, however,
there was no peripheral serous detachment [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3A">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3B">B</xref>].
The patient was given a repeat PST injection of triamcinalone
acetonide and the oral steroid was restarted at 1 mg/kg while
continuing with methotrexate. Ten days after starting the
steroids serous detachments resolved and the vision improved
to 20/200. Six weeks later the vision recovered to 20/60. The
steroid dose was gradually tapered over a period of 12 weeks
and maintained at 20 mg/ day with methotrexate reduced to
7.5 mg/week.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Sympathetic ophthalmia is a rare sight-threatening bilateral
panuveitis with an incidence of 0.03/100000.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> In our case, SO
occurred after parsplana vitrectomy which is a rare occurrence.
The reported incidence of SO following vitreoretinal surgeries
is 1 in 8001<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> and has shown an increasing trend, especially with
repeated surgeries. A corresponding risk following external
retinal detachment repair is 1 in 1357.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></p>
      <p>Kilmartin <italic>et al</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> in their study have noted that the current
SO risk following vitrectomy is more than twice that previously
reported by Gass (0.06%).</p>
      <p>Based on their study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> the same authors in a commentary
on SO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> have suggested that it would be appropriate
to counsel patients regarding the risk of SO before the
vitrectomy procedure. Pollack <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> in the largest case series
of SO following vitrectomy without a previous trauma have
noted that SO following such surgical procedure may have
diverse presentations and any atypical or persistent uveitis
following vitreous surgery should alert the treating surgeon
of possible SO.</p>
      <p>Another important manifestation in this case was NVD.
Although occurrence of NVD is known in Behcet&#x2032;s disease,
chronic uveitis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> and Vogt Koyanagi Harada disease,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> it
has not been reported in SO to the best of our knowledge. NVD was of
recurrent nature with the recurrence of inflammation.</p>
      <p>In our patient the clinical setting of previous ocular surgery
and findings in the left eye were consistent with a diagnosis
of SO. Early and prompt use of immunosuppressive therapy
with systemic steroids and steroid-sparing agents such as
cyclosporin A,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> azathioprine,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> chlorambucil have
improved the prognosis in patients with SO. In our case we were able
to use methotrexate to successfully control the inflammation
after initial treatment with a combination of intravenous, oral
and topical steroids.</p>
      <p>After the initial control of inflammation the patient
developed NVD after 14 weeks of immunosuppressive
treatment. Considering that this was the only seeing eye of
the patient and also the lack of a well-defined protocol for
treating such NVD in chronic uveitis, we decided to treat the
patient with PST injection of triamcinalone acetonide. A PRP
was also done considering the one-eyed status although there
was no ischemia on FFA. The combined therapeutic approach
was initially effective and resulted in regression of the NVD
after 12 weeks. However, the NVD recurred within 8 weeks
and was associated with multifocal serous detachments and
inflammation in the vitreous cavity. On restarting steroids with
another PST injection of triamcinalone acetonide the serous
detachments resolved within four days.</p>
      <p>Although the initial occurrence of NVD was not associated
with increased activity in vitreous its prompt response to steroids
(systemic + PST) and its later recurrence with inflammation is
suggestive of an inflammatory pathomechanism. The role of
PRP in this case is unclear, however, the recurrence of NVD with
flare-up of inflammation suggests that PRP may not be useful
in this setting. We suggest that systemic immunosuppression
along with repeated PST injection of triamcinalone acetonide
may be useful in treating such NVD in chronic uveitis.</p>
