        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>A 10-year-old, neutered male Labrador retriever presented with progressive left
hind lameness. Ultrasonography revealed large, subcutaneous, ovoid cysts around the stifle
joint. Radiographic and computed tomographic images revealed periosteal reaction of the
distal femur. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed a large cyst that was hypointense in
T1-weighted images, hyperintense in T2-weighted images and had a thin lining that was
enhanced by intravenous gadonium injection. The cyst communicated with the joint cavity
and other small cysts around the joint. Histopathology of an excisional biopsy specimen
led to diagnosis of ganglion cyst. This report provides MR images of a ganglion cyst in a
canine stifle.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Ganglion cysts are relatively common in humans [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>],
however, only a small number of cases (including a horse [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and several dogs [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]) have been reported in the
veterinary literature. To our knowledge, MR images of ganglion cysts formation relating to the
canine stifle joint have not been previously reported. Here, we described the clinical
features, diagnostic imaging including ultrasound, radiography, CT and MR images, and
histopathologic finding.</p>
    <p>A 10-year-old, neutered male Labrador retriever was examined for left hind leg lameness that
developed over a period of 3 months. A large mass was present on the lateral aspect of the
stifle joint, and there were superficial scratches on the skin over the mass. The mass was
sclerotic, and feverish, but there was no obvious pain without vigorous palpation. Fine needle
aspiration (FNA) of the mass produced a clear, viscous fluid that contained 482 nucleated
cells per <italic>&#xB5;l</italic>, 0.8 g of protein per d<italic>l</italic> and demonstrated good
clot formation during the mucin clot test. These results were consistent with normal synovial
fluid.</p>
    <p>Ultrasound revealed a large, anechoic, cystic lesion in the subcutaneous tissues around the
stifle joint, and it seemed to communicate with the stifle joint. No obvious, large, vascular
structures were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Ultrasonographic and radiographic images of the stifle joint of the left hind leg. (A)
This ultrasonographic image of the femur shows the anechoic lesion (white arrowhead) in
the subcutaneous tissues around the stifle joint. (B) This craniocaudal radiographic
image of the stifle shows periosteal reaction of the distal femur (black arrowhead) and
multiple radiolucent focal lesions adjacent to the articular surfaces of the femur and
tibia. (C) This lateral radiographic image of the stifle shows periosteal reaction of
the distal femur (black arrowhead) was present as well as periarticlular
osteophytes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-457-g001"/></fig>). Routine radiographs revealed periosteal reaction on the distal femur and multiple
radiolucent focal lesions adjacent to the articular surfaces of the femur and tibia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1B and 1C</xref>). It seemed likely there were
periarticular osteophytes noted at the distal patella, femoral condyles and proximal tibia
along with an apparent osseous fragment/new bone production at the origin of the cranial
cruciate ligament present as well. Computed tomography (CT) images (4 row helical: Asteion
Super 4<sup>&#xAE;</sup>, TOSHIBA Medical, Tokyo, Japan) showed hypoattenuate cystic lesions in the
subcutaneous tissues at the cranial and caudal aspects of the stifle joint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>CT images of the left stifle. (A) Sagittal CT images, soft tissue window, of the
stifle; there is the hypoattenuation area of the distal femur (black arrows). (B)
Coronal CT images, bone window, of the distal femur; there is the periosteal reaction of
the distal femur (white arrowhead).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-457-g002"/></fig>). CT images also confirmed the radiographic findings and detected a small calcified
region at the cyst margin in the cranial aspect of the distal femur, which was not visible in
the radiographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2B</xref>). On magnetic resonance
(MR) images obtained using a 0.4 T magnet (Aperto Inspire<sup>&#xAE;</sup>, HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan),
T1-weighted images revealed a large, hypointense oval shaped lesion at the cranial aspect of
the distal femur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3A</xref>). This lesion appeared to
be continuous with the stifle joint distal to the patella. T2-weighted images showed
hyperintense material in the corresponding area that was hypointense on T1-weighted images
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Contrast enhancement by intravenous
injection with 0.2 m<italic>l</italic>/kg of gadolinium (ProHance<sup>&#xAE;</sup>, Eisai, Tokyo,
Japan) highlighted an inner lining area of this lesion by T1-weighted images at the cranial
aspect of the distal femur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Multiple
small, round irregular subcutaneous lesions were observed caudal to the stifle. These lesions
were characterized as hypointense by T1-weighted images and hyperintense by T2-weighted
images. Although we could not examine the detail of the cruciate ligaments or menisci because
of limitation of low magnetic field MR instrument which we used, no obvious changes in the
cruciate ligaments or menisci were visible.</p>
    <p>The size of the largest cystic lesion and its connection with the stifle joint were likely
causing the lameness by restricting joint movement. We thus decided to remove the large cystic
lesion on the cranial aspect of the stifle in order to obtain a histopathological diagnosis
while simultaneously treating the lameness. A 3.0 &#xD7; 2.0 &#xD7; 1.0 cm cyst was found beneath the
subcutaneous tissues, attached to both the femur and patella. The cyst was dissected free of
the surrounding tissues and surgically excised. Since the wall of the cyst was composed of an
inner myxomatous layer and an outer fibromatous layer, but lacked synovial lining cells, the
lesion was diagnosed as a ganglion cyst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Sagittal magnetic resonance images of the left stifle. (A) The oval shape lesions were
hypointense in T1-weighted images (white arrows). (B) The lesions that were hypointense
in T1-weighted images were hyperintense in T2-weighted images (white arrows). (C) The
lining of the cyst, which was hypointense in T1-weighted images, was enhanced by
gadolinium injection (white arrowheads). Multiple small, subcutaneous, irregular round
like shape lesions were observed caudal to the stifle (open arrowheads).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-457-g003"/></fig><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_004" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Histopathological findings of the removed cyst. The cyst was composed of an inner
myxomatous layer (black arrows) and an outer fibromatous layer (black arrowheads). No
synovial lining cells were seen in the wall, and the lesion was diagnosed as a ganglion
cyst.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-457-g004"/></fig>).</p>
    <p>The differential diagnosis of swelling of stifle joint includes small fractures, cruciate
ligament damage, disruption of the long digital extensor tendon, osteoarthritis, synovitis,
infection within the articular joint, tumors such as synovial cell sarcoma, synovial cyst and
ganglion cyst. We were able to exclude many of these diseases after identifying synovial fluid
within a cyst-like structure. In addition, radiography, ultrasound, CT and MR image were
useful for investigating the relationship between the cyst and bone.</p>
    <p>Radiographs and CT images are useful for excluding small fractures or bone tumors, but are
not ideal for imaging for soft tissues. Ultrasound can help evaluate the swelling to determine
if it is fluid-filled (cystic) or solid, can detect whether there is a blood vessel associated
with the mass and can assist with guidance for FNA. The advantages of ultrasound are that it
is a widely available procedure and non-invasive and quick to perform. In our case, the
ultrasound revealed an anechoic cyst connecting with the stifle. Although Lunhao <italic>et
al</italic>. discuss the advantages of the ultrasound for the detection of small cruciate
ligament cysts and assessment of the other joint components in human medicine [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], we were not able to visualize the cruciate ligaments or
the caudal cysts in this case because of the extremely large cyst presented over the cranial
portion of the stifle joint.</p>
    <p>Overall, the MR images were very useful for determining the area of the cystic lesion and
provided superior visualization of the anatomic relationship between cyst and the stifle joint
and surrounding tissues. MR images were also useful for planning the surgical biopsy. In this
case, our MR images allowed us to diagnose the number and size of the cystic lesions and their
connection to the stifle joint, to determine that the ligaments and tendons of the joint were
not ruptured and to confirm that no tumor-like solid masses were present. The lesions in this
dog had a similar appearance in the MR images to those reported for ganglion cysts in both
humans and dogs [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Ganglion cysts usually have a
homogenous low signal intensity in T1-weighted images and a high signal intensity in
T2-weighted images, as we saw in this case. Because MR images are useful for visualizing soft
tissues and high tissue contrast, we were able to identify this characteristic of the lesion
and the association between the cystic lesion and other joint components before biopsy.</p>
    <p>In general, ganglion cysts contain clear, watery or mucinous fluid and do not directly
communicate with the synovial cavity of the adjacent joint [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, MR images in this dog revealed
a large, cystic lesion that seemed to communicate with the stifle joint. Although the etiology
of ganglion cysts is still unknown, trauma has been suggested as potential inciting factor
[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In this dog, there were skin wounds over the
stifle joint, indicating that accidental trauma may have caused the cyst to develop. Although
we could not elucidate the initial cause of cyst in this case, there are several possible
explanations for the apparent communication of the ganglion cyst with joint space. The
suspected trauma ruptured the joint capsule, resulting in inflammation and growth of the cyst;
the original ganglion cyst may have led to rupture of the joint leading to direct
communication; the cyst may have expanded and compressed the joint capsule. With the
radiographic and CT changes present, it seems most likely that trauma leads to a ruptured
joint capsule with subsequent progression of the cyst.</p>
    <p>This is the first report that describes the MR image of large ganglion cyst in canine stifle
joint. Unfortunately, complete excision of the ganglion cyst in this case was not possible due
to the large size. For future case, we should include the ganglion cyst in the differential
diagnosis list and utilize MR for both diagnosis as well as surgical planning.</p>
