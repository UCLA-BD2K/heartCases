      <abstract>
        <p>Multiple myeloma and JAK2 positive chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms are hematologic malignancies with a completely different cellular origin. Two cases of simultaneous occurrence of multiple myeloma, one with primary myelofibrosis and another one with essential thrombocythemia are reported in this article. In such cases, an accurate diagnosis requires a molecular testing, including gene sequencing and differential diagnosis of pancytosis associated with splenic amyloidosis. In general, in such cases, of two coexisting malignant hematologic diseases, the treatment of the most aggressive one is recommended. For our two cases, it was decided to start a Velcade based therapy. The main concern was the medullar toxicity, especially when a multiple myeloma was associated with a primary myelofibrosis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Multiple myeloma (MM) is a chronic malignant lymphoproliferation originating in B cell post - germinal center which has undergone somatic mutations and which has the ability to differentiate into plasma cells [<bold><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></bold>].</p>
      <p>Philadelphia chromosome negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a heterogeneous group of chronic diseases characterized by the cell proliferation of one or several hematopoietic lines. They are clonal diseases originating in a pluripotent myeloid hematopoietic stem cell that can differentiate between erythroid progenitors, granulocytic progenitors and the megakaryocytic progenitors [<bold><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></bold>]. This group of diseases includes primary myelofibrosis (PMF), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) [<bold><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></bold>]. Nearly all the patients (95%) with PV have the V617F somatic mutation present in the Janus kinase 2 gene (JAK2). This mutation is also found in 65% of the patients with PMF, respectively 55% of the patients with TE.</p>
      <p>The cases of two patients with multiple myeloma associated with primary myelofibrosis and, respectively, essential thrombocythemia, are presented in this article.</p>

      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>
        <bold>Case 1</bold>
      </p>
      <p>A 65-year-old patient with multiple comorbidities (previous surgery for aortic stenosis - metal prosthesis, peripheral vascular disease with angioplasty with stent in the left common iliac artery, with episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, ischemic nephropathy with renal artery stenosis, and chronic kidney disease &#x2013; 2nd degree), was admitted for investigation in the Hematology Centre of &#x201C;Fundeni&#x201D; Clinical Institute, Bucharest, for hepatosplenomegaly (liver diameter of 19.5 cm, homogeneous splenomegaly - bipolar diameter 16.7 cm), incidentally discovered on a routine ultrasound scan.</p>
      <p>Blood cell count (CBC) showed leukocytosis with immature granulocytes and erythroblasts on peripheral smear, with macrocytes, anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, and red blood cells inclusions and teardrop-shaped RBC. (WBC = 10,540/ mmc - Metamyelocytes 1, Bands 4, Neutrophils 72, Eosinophils 2, Basophils 2, Lymphocytes 12, Monocytes 7; Hb = 12 g/ dl, Hct = 35.9%, Plt = 407,000/ mmc).</p>
      <p>Renal tests revealed chronic kidney disease stage III B (creatinine = 2.55 mg/ dl, creatinine Clearance = 42.08 ml/ min.), and viral markers (HBsAg, HCV Ab, HIV) were negative.</p>
      <p>Bone marrow biopsy (BMB) examination showed a hypercellular marrow (about 80% marrow cellularity), with pronounced proliferation of megakaryo- and granulopoiesis: very frequently polymorphous megakaryocytes, with an atypical morphology (from giant megakaryocytes with cloud-like, bulbous nuclei to small dwarf megakaryocytes with hyperchromatic nuclei); megakaryocytes were densely clustered perivascularly and paratrabecularly; sinusoids were proliferated, without intravascular hematopoiesis (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref></bold>). Gomori silver stain for fibrosis showed grade 2 myelofibrosis (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref></bold>). The pathological diagnosis was PMF, fibrotic hypercellular stage.</p>

          <p>Aligned sequences showing mutation in JAK2 exon 14 - c1849 G&gt;T (V617F). Prevalence of this mutation in this patient was 72%. Sequencing was performed on Miseq Illumina. For JAK2 exon 12, 13 and 14 sequencing, specific primers, which amplify exon 12, 13 and 14, were used. After amplification, amplicons were purified by using Agencourt Ampure XP magnetic beads following the manufacturer's protocol. Purified amplicons were indexed by using indexes provided by Illumina and resulting fragments sequenced on Miseq sequencer from Illumina, after another round of purification by using Agencourt Ampure XP. Sequencing was performed by using MIseq kit Nano and 2x250 sequencing protocol. Resulting sequences were aligned by using LaserGene 11.2 software and visualized and analyzed by using IGV version 2.3.40. An average coverage of 10000x was obtained for all exons.</p>

      <p>The diagnosis of &#x201C;primary myelofibrosis&#x201D; was established and it was considered that the patient did not require a specific hematologic treatment; the patient should be monitored at every 3 months.</p>
      <p>After 6 months, the patient presented thoracolumbar spine pain, right paravertebral muscle contraction, and weight loss. CT scans showed multiple osteolytic lesions in the ribs and the scanned thoracic lumbar spine, and paravertebral tumor with the involvement of the spinal canal at T10. As the patient had motor neurological lesions with incomplete neurological injury Frankel C - T9 level, and retention of urine rapidly installed, he was urgently admitted to the Clinic of Neurosurgery, where a T10 spinal tumor ablation was performed, together with a reconstruction with polyacrylic cement, and metal synthesis T8, T9, T11 on the right side.</p>

        <bold>Case 2</bold>
      </p>
      <p>A 71-year-old female patient, known with invasive ductal breast carcinoma treated with mastectomy, chemotherapy and local radiotherapy (13 years before), has also presented thrombocytosis (Tr&gt; 700,000/ mmc) for approximately 7 years, for which she received aspenter treatment.</p>
      <p>Four years before, the patient was admitted in a Hematology Department to investigate that thrombocytosis; CBC showed thrombocytosis (Plt = 840,000/ mmc) with anisocytosis and macro platelets; normal results on clinical examination and imaging investigations (CT scan, bone scintigraphy and ultrasound). BMB examination showed a normal age-related marrow cellularity with mildly increased megakaryocytes: small loose clusters of large to giant megakaryocytes, with mature cytoplasm and multilobulated staghorn-like nuclei. The pathology of BMB was compatible with an ET. In addition, the investigations were supplemented with molecular biology tests - analyzing the DNA sample by Amplification - Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) &#x2013; PCRfor V617F somatic mutation in JAK2 gene. This mutation was identified in a heterozygous form in the JAK2 gene. The diagnosis was &#x201C;Essential thrombocythemia&#x201D; and treatment with Anagrelide was started. During treatment, the patient presented mild anemia (Hb = 10.9 g/ dl) and normal value platelets. Anemia was interpreted as a side effect of Anagrelide.</p>
      <p>The patient was admitted to the Hematology Centre of &#x201C;Fundeni&#x201D; Clinical Institute with mild skin pallor, ribs, spine and pelvis bone pain (started within the previous year), without organomegaly. The patient had not taken Anagrelid within the last three months.</p>
      <p>CBC: WBC = 8400/ mmc (normal white blood count), Hb 9.3 g/ dl, Hct 29.4%, Plt = 243,000/ mmc, rouleaux distribution of erythrocytes, without Howell - Jolly bodies. Coagulation tests and platelet aggregation in normal limits. Normal LAP.</p>
      <p>Serum protein electrophoresis: Total proteins = 10,1 g/ dl; Alb = 33.7%, Alfa1 = 3.2%, Alfa 2 = 12.4%, Beta 1 = 7.8%, Beta 2 = 4.2%, Gamma 1 = 1.6%, Gamma 2 = 37.1%, Monoclonal band in gamma globulin area = 3.7 g/ dl, Ig G = 2910 mg/ dl (Normal 700-1600 mg/ dL, Ig A &lt; 35.4 mg/ dl (70 &#x2013; 400 mg/ dL), Ig M = 37.2 mg/ dl (40 &#x2013; 230 mg/ dL).</p>

      <p>The imaging tests performed were: skeletal radiography (which showed a score &gt; 3 osteolytic lesions at skull level); Magnetic Resonance Imagining for the spine and pelvis, revealing diffuse bone structural changes affecting the lumbar vertebral floor and the pelvic bones, suggestive of a tumor substrate) and abdominal ultrasound (which did not reveal hepato-splenomegaly).</p>
      <p>The bone marrow biopsy was repeated and this showed a hyper cellular marrow with diffuse atypical plasma cells infiltration (approx. 60%); small clusters of giant megakaryocytes still remaining (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref></bold>). IHC stain showed clonality of marrow plasma cell infiltrate, with lambda light chain restriction (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref></bold>). The pathological diagnosis was lambda light chain MM associated with ET.</p>
      <p>An abdominal fat pad biopsy was negative for Congo red stain. No signs of amyloidosis were identified.</p>

      <p>Considering all the investigations performed, the diagnosis of &#x201C;Multiple myeloma IgG lambda stage III A associated with type I cryoglobulinemia; JAK2 positive Essential Thrombocythemia&#x201D; was established and it was considered necessary to start the treatment for multiple myeloma, due to the advanced stage of the disease and the presence of cryoglobulinemia, while there were no criteria for starting or continuing the treatment for ET.</p>
      <p>We decided to initiate therapy according to the CyBorD (Velcade, Cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone) protocol and bisphosphonates.</p>
      <p>Regarding the treatment of multiple myeloma for the two cases presented, it is to be noted that these were patients older than 65 years, who had multiple comorbidities and were not eligible for autologous bone marrow transplant consolidation; and, for this reason, they continued the treatment based on bortezomib regimen. Subsequently, the patient was monitored once at every 3 months (blood cell counts, kidney function, blood viscosity, 2 beta microglobulin, lactic dehydrogenase test, serum protein electrophoresis, Ig level, monitoring of serum free light chains assays), bone marrow aspiration and/ or imagistic evidence (Skeletal Radiography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging). The treatment with bisphosphonates was continued monthly for a period of 24 months.</p>
      <p>In terms of chronic myeloproliferative syndrome, at every 3 months, blood cell count with differential white blood count and an abdominal ultrasound was performed.</p>

      <title>Discussions</title>
      <p>The association of multiple myeloma with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms is a rare occurrence. Malhotra [<bold><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></bold>] reported 15 patients who were diagnosed with MPN and plasma cell disorder such as multiple myeloma or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Most of these patients were diagnosed with MPN prior to or simultaneously with MM or MGUS.</p>
      <p>From our perspective, the association of these two diseases raised a few issues that are very important in theory, but also clinically:</p>
      <p>- The issue of the relationship between the two malignancies occurring in the same patient:</p>
      <p>Is there a common hematopoietic stem cell for MM and MPN? This is an unsustainable hypothesis, since there is data demonstrating the cellular origin of MPN in a myeloid hematopoietic stem cell, while MM originates in the B lymphocyte, which suffered somatic mutations in the germinative center.</p>
      <p>Regarding the issue of whether the therapy administered for a disease influenced the development of a second neoplastic disease - in the first case, this was out of the question, since the two diseases were diagnosed almost simultaneously. In the second case, there was room for discussion - the patient was known with a history of breast cancer treated with an intense chemo and radiation therapy.</p>
      <p>- The diagnosis issue: </p>
      <p>In the first case of JAK2 positive primary myelofibrosis preceding with 6 months the diagnosis of multiple myeloma, the evolution was practically simultaneous. The advanced bone marrow fibrosis associated with multiple myeloma was found in 20.5% out of 44 patients with multiple myeloma and was a negative prognosis factor &#x2013; with an average survival period of 11 months [<bold><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></bold>]. In our case, the initial diagnosis was primary myelofibrosis with all the specific criteria, including the molecular ones and the diagnosis of multiple myeloma was missed, even though when we reassessed the bone marrow biopsy, the signs of plasma cell monoclonal proliferation were found. In terms of histopathology, the presence of bone marrow fibrosis (that modifies the bone marrow tissue architecture) can delay the identification of small associated plasma cells infiltrates, requiring further investigations (e.g. immunohistochemistry) and a correlation with the clinical data [<bold><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></bold>,<bold><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></bold>]. On the other hand, a significant bone marrow plasma cell infiltration dislocates the normal hematopoiesis to a variable degree, making it difficult to pathologically sustain the diagnosis of associated myeloproliferative neoplasm and its differentiation from secondary megakaryocyte hyperplasia to a monoclonal gammopathy. Moreover, the difficulty of the multiple myeloma diagnosis, in this case, is enhanced by the fact that the clonal population of plasma cell secrete only free light chain (micromolecular multiple myeloma), the serum protein electrophoresis appearance is normal, and the final serological diagnosis can be established only by the free light chains assay or by the serum protein immunofixation.</p>
      <p>In the second case, the diagnosis of ET was established four years before the development of the multiple myeloma criteria. In our experience, some cases of multiple myeloma and associated amyloidosis (AL amyloidosis) have leukocytosis, thrombocytosis and/ or erythrocytosis. Cases of primary amyloidosis were reported to start as pancytosis by amyloid related functional hyposplenism [<bold><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></bold>]. The peripheral blood smear examination and identification of Howell - Jolly bodies in the red cells are very important in all these cases.</p>
      <p>- The therapy issue:</p>
      <p>Generally, in such situations where two hematological malignancies coexist, we recommend the treatment of the most aggressive disease. In our case, it was necessary to start the Bortezomib - based therapy. Of course, the primary concern was the bone marrow toxicity, especially when a multiple myeloma was associated with a primary myelofibrosis.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>The simultaneous occurrence of multiple myeloma and JAK2 positive myeloproliferative neoplasms is possible, although the underlying mechanism is not very well understood. For an accurate diagnosis, the use of molecular methods and the elimination of any confusing situations such as fibrosis associated to multiple myeloma, and, respectively, pancytosis via splenic amyloidosis associated to multiple myeloma, are recommended.</p>
