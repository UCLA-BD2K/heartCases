        <p>A 68-yr-old male, smoker, is admitted for proteinuria (2,800&#x2005;mg/24 h) and
reduced renal function (serum creatinine 2&#x2005;mg/dl, GFR 35 ml/min). Renter, he started
working 20-yr-old as a sandstone cave miner. Despite the high levels of silica dusts, he
reported no mandatory use of airways protection devices during the first 25&#x2005;yr of
activity. No clinical or radiological signs of silicosis or pneumoconiosis where reported
until the year of retirement (1997). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (91&#x2005;mm/h) and C
reactive protein (35&#x2005;mg/l) suggested a pro-inflammatory status. High serum IgA was found
(465&#x2005;mg/dl). A renal biopsy identified glomerular sclerosis with IgA deposition, signs of
diffuse vasculitis and tubular atrophia suggesting a diagnosis of IgA nephropathy. Chest
X-Rays showed emphysema and diffuse nodularity suggesting diagnosis of silicosis. Chest
tomography was also positive for mild signs of silicosis with silicotic nodules and
without honeycombing. IgA nephropathy is the most common type of glomerulonephritis
worldwide. Several clues suggest a genetic or acquired abnormality of immune system as a
trigger of the increased production of IgA. In our case report, simultaneous kidney and
pulmonary disease could suggest same triggers (e.g. exposure to virus, bacteria or
environmental agents) inducing IgA synthesis and pulmonary immune system activation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Despite the first report of kidney disease in silica-exposed workers dates more than 50&#x2005;yr
ago<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, scientific evidences of
&#x201C;<italic>silica nephrotoxicity</italic>&#x201D; remained limited, controversial, associated to
anecdotal reports and few clinical and pathological studies<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although evidences still
remain too sparse to be conclusive, silica is actually a suspected risk agent for kidney
diseases<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>First studies reported a clear tubular involvement; however subsequent availability of
reliable biomarkers for early glomerular dysfunction (e.g. low molecular weight proteins and
enzymes) suggested the silica dusts as a more complex nephrotoxic agent<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Indeed, in the last 10&#x2005;yr, several major studies have
linked prolonged exposure to crystalline silica with renal diseases and particularly
glomerulonephritis<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>Pathologic properties of silica remain discussed. Actually, it could damage the kidney
from: (a) direct toxicity of the particles reaching the tissue; (b) deposition in the kidney
of immune-complexes following inflammation; (c) auto-immune mechanisms<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, eventually activated by the strong immune reaction in the
lung tissue<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>Immune system over-activation, with subsequent auto-immune mechanisms induction, is also a
cornerstone in silicosis progression in several pathogenetic models, and should justify
frequent association of immune disease (e.g. Erasmus syndrome, rheumatic diseases) in
silicotic patients<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>IgA nephropathy (also known as Berger&#x2019;s Disease) is the most common immune-mediated
glomerular disease worldwide<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>: here we
present a case where renal involvement and signs of silicosis where simultaneously
identified with a similar follow-up.</p>

      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>A 68-yr-old male, smoker (18.8 pack-year smoking history), Caucasian, was admitted to our
hospital in October 2005 for proteinuria (2,800&#x2005;mg/24&#x2005;h) and reduced renal function (serum
creatinine 2&#x2005;mg/dl, GFR 35 ml/min), serendipitously stated during routine exams performed by
the patient.</p>
      <p>Renter, he started working 20-yr-old as a miner in a quarry of granite and sandstone, a
sedimentary rock composed of sand-size mineral and rock grains, containing high levels of
quartz. His tasks comported initial processing of sandstone blocks, performed mainly in open
spaces, and their refining with mechanical and/or manual chisel&#x2014;completed in working rooms
poorly aerated.</p>
      <p>Despite high levels of silica dusts in the work environment, he reported no mandatory use
of airways protection devices during the first 25&#x2005;yr of activity.</p>
      <p>In conformity of Italian Legislation for medical surveillance on workplaces, he had annual
medical examinations, comprising physical evaluation and chest X-ray, without clinical or
radiological signs of silicosis or pneumoconiosis. Lung function tests were unavailable.
After the year of retirement (1997), the patient performed annual blood and urine tests,
stating normal glomerular filtration rate, and no signs of chronic inflammatory disease.</p>
      <p>Urinalysis on admission confirmed nephritic-range proteinuria, microematuria, RBC casts and
granular casts. Determination of sedimentation rate (91&#x2005;mm/h), C reactive protein (35&#x2005;mg/l)
showed a pro-inflammatory status. High serum IgA was found (465&#x2005;mg/dl).</p>
      <p>A diagnosis of IgA nephropathy was proposed, and a renal biopsy performed identifying mild
glomerular sclerosis with IgA deposition, signs of diffuse vasculitis and tubular atrophy
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Renal biopsy. Renal biopsies showed glomeruli with segmental thickening and
enlargement of the mesangial axes (a), while a few ones were completely sclerotic (b),
resembling a focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Some of the glomeruli showed initial
formation of florid crescents and small flocculo-capsular synechiae (e). Glomeruli had
slightly thickened basal membranes and coarse mesangial deposits (c, f). Broad areas
of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis were present (d). Arteries has variable
degree of fibrosis (g).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="indhealth-54-074-g001"/></fig>).</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a routinary chest X-Rays showed diffuse signs of emphysema, and stated diffuse,
previously not reported nodularities, located in the upper right fields. A high resolution
chest tomography (HRCT) was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>HRCT performed after diagnosis of IgA nephropathy. The scans show diffuse
centrilobular and para-septal emphysema, more profuse at higher lobes. High density
nodules were randomly diffused: in subpleural position, they were accompanied by
subpleural thickening, in particular at left superior lobe in dorsal position (a, b,
c). Mediastinal lymph-nodes appeared enlarged, in particular at left hilum. Scant
peribronchial thickenings were diffusely identified, and more evident in right lower
lobe, whereas a mild, diffuse interstial involvement was evident at left basis (images
c and d). Prone position was necessary in order to avoid the gravity dependent
opacities that could have obscured the subtle interstitial changes of this early stage
of silicosis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="indhealth-54-074-g002"/></fig>) and resulted positive for diffuse centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema, more
profuse in the upper lobes. Small size high density nodules appeared randomly diffused in
all scans, whereas several pleural and subpleural high-density nodules were also identified,
in particular in the dorsal upper left lobe. Scant peri-bronchial thickenings were also
identified at right lower lobe. Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes appeared enlarged, in
particular at left hilum.</p>
      <p>Because of occupational history of prolonged exposure to high levels of silica dust, and
the radiological pattern, a mild form of chronic (active) silicosis was then supposed<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>: a confirmatory lung biopsy was not
performed because of clinical conditions of the patients.</p>
      <p>The simultaneous manifestations of kidney and lung disease were then supposed as consistent
with a diagnostic hypothesis of IgA nephropathy associated with silicosis, and the patient
started with specific immune-suppressing therapy. General conditions remained stable during
the following 18 months, without clinical signs of progression of both renal and pulmonary
disease.</p>
      <p>Eventually, 18 months after the first episode, clinically relevant proteinuria
(2,200&#x2005;mg/24&#x2005;h) was identified at urinalysis, suggesting a relapse of the IgA nephropathy
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig.
3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>High resolution Chest Tomography performed at the relapse of IgA nephropathy (18
months after the first episode). The direct comparison with the previous scans
suggests a significant progression of the underlying emphysema, with bilateral
centrilobular and parasettal pattern and traction bronchiectasis at lower fields
(D&#x2013;I). High density nodularities appeared of increased diameter (1&#x2013;2&#x2005;mm) and more
profuse, in particular at hilar and subpleural level (B&#x2013;F, see for comparison <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2, a&#x2013;c</xref>). Interstitial involvement was also
more evident, with a diffuse reticulo-nodular pattern (visual score 10%) (E&#x2013;I).
Mediastinal lymph nodes appeared enlarged, in particular at paratracheal (maximal
diameter 2&#x2005;cm) and para-aortic (maximal diameter 2.2&#x2005;cm), deprived of calcifications,
suggesting a recent, acute and massive activation of immune system (A&#x2013;C).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="indhealth-54-074-g003"/></fig>). A follow-up HRCT was then performed: a more diffuse pattern of centrilobular and
paraseptal emphysema in upper lobes was identified (visual score: 50% ca. of total lung
volume). Panlobular emphysema with diffuse bronchiectasis was identified at lower lobes,
with extensive tissutal involvement. In general, a reticulo-nodular pattern of interstitial
lung disease was evident (visual score 10%). In hilar regions, the nodules appeared also
more diffuse (diameter 1&#x2013;2&#x2005;mm). Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes were also of increased
volume, without signs of calcification. Eventually, a panlobular emphysema with extensive
tissutal involvement was identified in a setting of fibrotic non-specific interstitial
pneumonia: signs of chronic active silicosis were also identified, confirming the previous
diagnosis. A new cycle of immune-suppressing therapy was then started, achieving the
temporary stabilization of both renal and pulmonary diseases.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3">
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Silicosis is suspected to be an immune disease, involving activation of primitive highly
conserved genes, like those involved in the Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) pathway<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Following these hypothesis, progression
from silica dust deposition in lung parenchyma to diffuse fibrosis, silicotic nodule
formation and, finally, honeycombing, would be accelerated in presence of favourable genetic
pattern, explaining the presence of rapidly progressive pattern also for low environmental
or occupational silica dust exposure<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>IgA nephropathy, the most common type of glomerulonephritis worldwide, is also suspected as
an immune disease<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Genetic or acquired
abnormalities of immune system would be a trigger for increased production of IgA, which
deposition in glomerulus induces and propagates renal disorder.</p>
      <p>The simultaneous kidney and pulmonary involvement stated in this case report at diagnosis
and follow up could suggest the same pathogenetic cascade, following exposure silica dusts
and induced by virus, bacteria or environmental agents, able to induce massive IgA synthesis
and pulmonary immune system activation.</p>
      <p>Despite the worldwide diffusion of IgA nephropathy and several reports stating renal
function alteration and high prevalence of IgA nephropathy in subjects exposed to silica
dusts, we found only two other similar reports, but only one published in English-written
medical journal<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, the recent retrospective study of Vacek <italic>et
al.</italic> on 7,052 workers employed between 1947 and 1998 in the Vermont granite
industry failed to assess a statistically significant association between silica exposure
and death for nephritis and/or nephrosis (standardized mortality ratio 0.99, 95%CI
0.68&#x2013;1.38)<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. This fact could suggest
only a serendipitous association between two unrelated pathologies, focusing on smoking
history as the main individual risk factor for IgA nephropathy<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>However, several elements from this case report may suggest a different interpretation. On
the one hand, the cumulative smoking exposure of our patient was relatively low in order to
explain <italic>per se</italic> both pulmonary and renal involvement<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the other hand, previous reports suggest a parallel
disease progression, where control of glomerulonephritis relapses would be associated with a
better prognosis of lung disease<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>In our patient, an initially mild silica-induced lung disease, with few or no signs at
conventional CXR, could have been worsened by the same immune system over-activation
resulting in IgA nephropathy<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, as the relapse
identified at follow-up may suggest. In this case, a better control of renal disease
progression and relapses would be the cornerstone to avoid or to slow the evolution of lung
fibrosis towards severe honeycombing<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
