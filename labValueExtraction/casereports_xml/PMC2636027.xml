      <abstract>
        <p><italic>Holi</italic>  festival is celebrated in India traditionally by applying colors on one another. Various ocular
	 adverse effects of these colors have been reported including conjunctivitis and corneal abrasion. We report a case of bilateral
	 periorbital necrotizing fasciitis, following exposure to <italic> Holi</italic>  colors. General physicians might encounter more
	 such cases after exposure to <italic> Holi</italic>  colors. In India, these colors are prepared on a small scale and lack any
	 quality checks. Use of such toxic colors should be discouraged, and all doctors should caution people against using synthetic dyes.
	 This case report highlights the need to put manufacturing of <italic> Holi</italic>  colors under guidelines of the Food and Drug
	 Cosmetic Act and the Bureau of Indian Standards.</p>

  <body>
    <p><italic>Holi</italic>  is a festival of colors, traditionally celebrated by greeting others by applying various
	powdered or water-based colors, usually on the face. These colors include various synthetic dyes which have harmful side-effects on
	the skin and mucocutaneous areas like the conjunctiva. This article is the first case report of a life-threatening infection as a
	result of exposure to <italic> Holi</italic>  colors.</p>
    <sec sec-type="">
      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>A 57-year-old male patient presented with redness, excessive watering and foreign body sensation
in both eyes, along with painful swelling and skin ulcers around both eyes over the past two days. There was no history of trauma,
diabetes or other systemic disease. However, the patient gave history of playing <italic> Holi</italic>  with dry colors three days
back. He was febrile for the past two days and had not sought any medical care.</p>
      <p>On examination, there was conjunctival chemosis and small corneal epithelial abrasions, along with bilateral periorbital ulcerative
lesions with superficial gangrene formation <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">[Fig. 1]</xref>. The surrounding lid and facial skin was
edematous and indurated. The ulcers were shallow, with a necrotic base and purulent discharge. Skin over the face and neck regions was
stained pink due to exposure to the colors. Patient was febrile (104&#xBA; F). The rest of the examination was unremarkable.</p>
      <p>A provisional diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis was made. Swabs were taken from the ulcer base for culture and antibiotic
sensitivity. Laboratory investigations included hemogram, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), blood sugar, enzyme linked immunosorbent
essay (ELISA) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and blood culture. Patient was started on intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic
therapy, which included ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime and metronidazole. Topical ciprofloxacin eye drops and artificial tear substitutes
were prescribed along with application of mupirocin ointment over the ulcers.</p>
      <p>Over the next two days, patient was afebrile but he developed deep-seated ulcers extending up to the orbital septum. Swab culture
showed <italic> Staphylococcus aureus</italic>  along with mixed anaerobic flora. Laboratory reports revealed marked leucocytosis with
neutrophilia. Rest of the laboratory tests were normal. Repeated debridements of the necrosed tissue with irrigation of the ulcer bases
with 5% povidone iodine solution was done. Over the next five days, the ulcers started to heal. Intravenous antibiotics were
continued for the next 14 days along with daily dressings of the wound. As a result of scarring, patient developed bilateral cicatricial
ectropion of all four lids. To prevent exposure keratopathy, temporary tarsorrhaphy was performed and patient was discharged on oral
ciprofloxacin for the next seven days.</p>
      <p>Bilateral lid reconstructive surgery was done at three months. Full-thickness skin grafting was done to reconstruct the anterior
lamina of both the upper and lower lids. A thorough excision of the scar tissue was done and the lids were reconstructed with donor skin
from the postauricular area and inner upper arm. In addition, on the right side, the scar tissue that was extending till the upper cheek
area was excised thoroughly and the area covered with split skin graft. A temporary tarsorrhaphy was done and kept in place for six
weeks. The final outcome was mild ectropion of lower lids and mild lagophthalmos and lid lag. However, there was no corneal exposure and
the patient was kept on tear substitutes subsequently.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The colors used during <italic> Holi</italic>  include various synthetic dyes like malachite
green, auramine, methyl violet, rhodamine and orange II. These are often mixed in a base material like starch or wheat flour. At times,
even mica dust is added to them to increase their shine. Most of these chemicals are phototoxic and incite skin allergies. Use of mica
dust can lead to multiple microtrauma of skin and predispose to infections. Also, use of contaminated starch or wheat flour can further
increase the chances of skin or ocular infections. We believe that these factors led to bilateral periorbital necrotizing fasciitis in
our patient. Dada <italic> et al</italic> .<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>  have reported ocular injuries due to <italic>]
Holi</italic>  colors. In our case report, the patient also developed mild corneal epithelial abrasions and conjunctival chemosis due to
exposure to the colors.</p>
      <p>Necrotizing fasciitis usually occurs after trauma, especially in diabetics, chronic alcoholics and immunocompromised patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>  It is an uncommon but severe soft tissue infection causing cutaneous gangrene and suppurative
fasciitis. It frequently involves the groin, lower extremities and abdomen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>  but occasional case
reports of periorbital necrotizing fasciitis following trauma by wooden splinters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>  and head
trauma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>  have been reported. Although <italic> Streptococcus</italic>  and <italic>
Staphylococcus</italic>  are the most common infective agents, the necrotic base of ulcers may also develop secondary infection by a
combination of various facultative and anaerobic organisms.</p>
      <p>Periorbital necrotizing fasciitis carries a high rate of mortality of up to 12.5%. This emphasizes the importance of an early
diagnosis and a prompt, extensive intravenous antibiotic therapy along with repeated surgical debridement. Lid reconstruction surgeries
may be required for complications like severe cicatricial ectropion and exposure keratopathy.</p>
      <p>In India, <italic> Holi</italic>  colors are prepared on a small scale and lack any quality checks. Alternatives like vegetable dyes
prepared from various plant extracts have been developed in the Indian Toxicology Research Centre and National Botanical Research
Institute. They lack the mechano-abrasive and phototoxic properties of synthetic dyes. Use of such non-toxic colors should be
encouraged, and doctors should caution people against using synthetic dyes such as <italic> Holi</italic>  colors.</p>
