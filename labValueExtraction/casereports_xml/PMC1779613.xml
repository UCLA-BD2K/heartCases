      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>We report what is to our knowledge the first case of a
urinary tract infection caused by <italic>Photobacterium damsela</italic>,
a virulent pathogen, in a 22-year-old gravid female at 23-week
gestation.</p>
      <p>The patient initially presented for routine prenatal care. At this
time she reported frequency and dysuria with no other complaints.
She denied any significant past medical history. The only finding
on physical examination was suprapubic tenderness and leukocytosis
was noted on the urine dipstick. A urine culture was obtained and
the patient was treated empirically with Cephalexin 500 mg qid
for one week. The urine culture subsequently demonstrated growth
&gt; 100000 colonies of <italic>Photobacterium damsela</italic>, which was
sensitive to cephalosporins,
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and aminoglycosides.
Given the rarity of infection with this
pathogen, a more detailed history was obtained where the patient
stated have had sexual intercoursein the Caribbean Sea off the
coast of Puerto Rico, one week prior to her office visit.</p>
      <p>One week after having her first office visit and the urine culture
with the above findings, the patient presented to labor and
delivery complaining of fever, chills, and foul smelling urine at
24-week gestation. On the day prior to admission, she noted that
her urine was malodorous. She complained of suprapubic tenderness
and mild right flank pain. On examination she was noted to have an
oral temperature of 101.6 and suprapubic tenderness, no
costovertebral angle tenderness was noted. No contractions were
palpated and on vaginal examination a closed uneffaced cervical os
was noted. The white blood cell count was 8800 with 79%
polymorphonuclear lymphocytes and no bandemia was present.
A urinalysis showed trace blood, positive nitrites, and some
bacteria. The fetal heart rate was reassuring and no contractions
were noted on the tocometer.</p>
      <p>Given the history of the unusual pathogen that grew a week prior
to this presentation, the patient was admitted with the diagnosis
of pyelonephritis in pregnancy and was started on Cefazolin
2 g IV every 6 hours, and Gentamicin 120 mg IV every 8
hours. The patient remained febrile for 24 hours at which time she
had her last temperature spike of 101.6 and fetal tachycardia
was noted to 180 beats per minute. She was maintained on the
aforementioned antibiotic therapy and defervesced. A complete
blood count was repeated on hospital admission day number 3 and
her white blood cell count remained within normal limits. On
admission day 3 the peak and trough for gentamicin showed
therapeutic levels of the antibiotic. No growth was observed on
the blood cultures done on admission. The patient was discharged
home on hospital day number five. She was advised to take Bactrim
for one week followed by suppressive therapy with Macrobid for the
remainder of the pregnancy. Urine cultures were repeated monthly
for the next 3 months and all remained negative.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Vibrionaceae are classified into six genera, namely, Vibrio,
Allomonas, Enhydrobacter, Listonella, Photobacterium, and
Salinivibrio. All Vibrio species are common to marine
environments, abundant in coastal waters, and have large increases
in cell densities in warmer months (particularly in temperate
climates), correlating with corresponding increases in disease
prevalence. Some of the Vibrio species (V cholerae, V
parahaemolyticus, V fluvialis, V furnissii, V hollisae, and V
mimicus) are primarily associated with diarrheal disease whereas
others cause wound infections (V alginolyticus, V damsela)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p>
      <p><italic>Photobacterium damsela</italic> was first identified in 1981.
Initially, classified as a member of the <italic>Vibrio</italic> species
which was known to cause death in immunocompromised hosts, it was
subsequently designated as <italic>Listonella damsela.</italic> Ultimately
this organism was reclassified based on phenotypic data as
<italic>Photobacterium</italic>. This is a facultative anaerobic
gram-negative bacillus that is pathogenic in both marine life and
humans. Its habitat is primarily warm seawater and is most
abundant during the summer months. <italic>P</italic> damsela is a known
pathogen causing skin ulcers in fish, probably deriving its name
from its common victim, the damselfish Chromis punctipinnis.
Photobacterium damselae subsp. damselae isolates are known to
cause disease in mice and have the capacity to produce large
amounts of a cytotoxin (damselysin) with activity against mice
erythrocytes in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Damselysin is a phospholipase-D
whose activity has been clearly demonstrated
in mice and no homologous DNA sequence has been isolated
in the other <italic>Vibrio</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>The damage caused by this bacterium has been suggested to be
attributable more to the cytotoxin than to the bacterium itself.
More recently, Osorio et al, using polymerase chain reaction
techniques, concluded that the dly gene is not a prerequisite for
pathogenicity, and therefore the role of damselysin as the main
virulence factor should be reevaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>Several cases have been described in the literature of
<italic>Photobacterium damsela</italic> as a cause of necrotizing
fasciitis in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Given the potentially life
threatening nature of this infection, early recognition is
essential and has been emphasized in the literature. The primary
route of infection is minor wounds inflicted by marine life in
brackish water with subsequent bacterial inoculation.
Contamination of preexisting wounds has also been described. The
progression of the disease described in the literature
constitutes an initial cellulitis with rapid progression
advancing to septic shock and occasions the
infected patients may present with relatively inconspicuous skin
lesions consistent with an uncomplicated cellulitis and often
outpatient antibiotic therapies were prescribed. Patients
subsequently return with bulla, subcutaneous hemorrhage, and acute
systemic illness with 36 hours of initial evaluation.</p>
      <p>Knight et al described a case of bacteremia
secondary to Photobacterium damsela in the Caribbean in a child
with sickle cell disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>We describe the first case of urinary tract infection secondary to
<italic>Photobacterium damsela</italic>. It is also the first case report
of a pregnant patient with <italic>P</italic> damsela infection. This isolate was
the only pathogen cultured from urine obtained routinely in a
symptomatic pregnant, otherwise healthy woman. We can hypothesize
that the history of sexual intercourse in the Caribbean coastal
waters of Puerto Rico during the summer, one week prior to
becoming symptomatic with dysuria and frequency, provided the
portal of entry for the pathogen.</p>
      <p>Sexual intercourse and pregnancy are among the most common risk
factors for urinary tract infections in young women. <italic>E
coli</italic> accounts for approximately 80% of all uncomplicated UTIs.
Other pathogens include <italic>Klebsiella, Enterobacter,
Serratia, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Providencia, Moraganell,
Staphylococci, Streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis,
Chlamydia, and Candida</italic>. However, urinary tract
infection with Photobacterium
damsela has never been previously described in the literature.
Moreover, other reports have documented this organism's resistance
to ampicillin, as was the case with our isolate. Given the high
rate of resistance (approximately 30%), ampicillin's use for
the treatment of urinary tract infections is not advised. In
addition this choice appears to be definitively ineffective in
treating this particular pathogen.</p>
      <p>The patient was admitted with the diagnosis of pyel-onephritis one
week after receiving the empiric therapy with Cephalexin, and was
started on Cefazolin IV and Gentamicin IV for which the isolate
was sensitive. Blood cultures were negative on admission,
where as per the previous cases reported, bacteremia with this
pathogen may become lethal producing multiorgan failure. Her early
presentation to a physician secondary to symptoms and her pregnant
status, along with early empiric therapy with Cephalexin, to which
the isolate was sensitive, may have contributed to the relatively
benign course in our patient. The effect of urine pH and its
bacteriostatic properties and the natural resistance of bladder
mucosa to infection may have contributed to decreased bacterial
proliferation or decreased production of cytotoxin, hence
minimizing the virulence.</p>
      <p>Even though this patient had a relatively indolent course, given
the pathogenesis of this organism as previously described in the
literature; the possibility of life-threatening sequelae should
prompt aggressive therapy if <italic>Photobacterium damsela</italic>
infection is suspected.</p>
