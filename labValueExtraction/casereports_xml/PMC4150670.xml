  <body>
    <p><bold>Clinical data:</bold> The patient is followed-up since birth with diagnosis of mild
stenosis of bivalved aortic valve. Remained until two years with aortic transvalvular
pressure gradient between 30 and 40 mmHg and without physical limitation. Fatigue with
exertion is observed for two years, coinciding with increased aortic transvalvular pressure
gradient to 60 mmHg in addition to the evidence of mild left ventricular hypertrophy on
echocardiogram (interventricular septum and posterior wall = 12 mm).</p>
    <p><bold>Physical examination:</bold> Eupneic, acyanotic, normal pulse. Weight: 86 Kg, Height:
180 cm, BP: 120/80 mmHg, HR: 82 bpm, saturation O<sub>2 </sub>= 96%. Aorta was mildly
palpable in suprasternal notch.</p>
    <p>In precordium, <italic>ictus cordis</italic> was not palpable and there were no systolic
impulses. Heart sounds were normophonetic and mild systolic murmur was auscultated, +/++ of
intensity, rough, on aortic area, furcula, neck vessels and on the left sternal border,
with thrill. There was a distinct protosystolic snap across the precordium. Liver was not
palpable.</p>

      <p><bold>Electrocardiogram:</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>)
presented normal sinus rhythm and morphology of P, QRS and T waves, without signs of
cavity overload. Ventricular repolarization was normal. AP: +40&#xBA;, AQRS:
0&#xBA;, AT: 20 &#xBA;.</p>

      <p><bold>Echocardiogram Bi-Doppler:</bold> showed heart chambers with normal size and
function. There was mild left ventricular hypertrophy with 12 mm thick ventricular
septum and posterior wall. Aortic annulus was 35 mm, ascending aorta was 45 mm and
maximum aortic transvalvular pressure gradient was 60 mmHg, and mean, 45 mmHg. Other
measurements corresponded to LA = 40, RV = 20, LV = 59, EF = 70%, delta D = 40%, RVSP =
25 mmHg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

      <p><bold>Clinical diagnosis:</bold> Moderate stenosis of bivalved aortic valve with
dilation of ascending aorta, in adult patient in functional class II.</p>
      <p><bold>Clinical reasoning:</bold> Clinical elements were compatible with the diagnosis of
aortic valvular stenosis of moderate repercussion, with systolic murmur in aortic
region, fatigue with exertion, supported by mild dilation of ascending aorta clearly
showed on chest radiography and confirmed on echocardiogram. The data confirmation was
established by transvalvular pressure gradient and left ventricular hypertrophy showed
on echocardiogram. The absence of changes of ventricular repolarization on ECG indicates
that the pressure gradient does not exceed 60 mmHg.</p>
      <p><bold>Differential diagnosis:</bold> Clinical findings of complementary tests
characteristic of aortic valvular stenosis must be differentiated from other obstructive
areas such as supra or subvalvular aortic region. The presence of a distinct snap of
valvular opening indicates obstruction at the valvular level, in addition to
high-pitched systolic murmur.</p>
      <p><bold>Conduct:</bold> Indication for aortic valve replacement surgery was established
with the onset of fatigue symptoms associated with signs of progressive worsening, such
as increased aortic gradient, myocardial hypertrophy and dilation of ascending aorta.
Percutaneous interventional treatment was not considered for being a bivalved aortic
valve, with dilation of aortic annulus, and presence of the clear risk of causing aortic
insufficiency. For the surgery, bivalved aortic valve was resected, thickened and
Bentall and De Bono surgery with plastic tube in the ascending aorta, replacement of
coronary arteries and implantation of mechanic valve n. 23 were performed, with positive
evolution.</p>
      <p><bold>Comments:</bold> Congenital aortic valve stenosis when mild in children and
teenagers, with pressure gradient below 30 mmHg, presents worsening in half the cases in
adulthood. In the presence of bivalved aortic valve, there is an increased possibility
for dilation of ascending aorta. It is believed that this dilation dependents on
abnormal flow jets towards the vessel. However, there are those who defend genetic
modification as its cause. Percutaneous interventional treatment is not recommended for
these cases due to valvular failure after balloon dilation of the valve. Placement of
valved stent also has difficulties, particularly when fixing it, due do aortic annulus
dilation. Surgical prescription in this case was evident due to symptoms worsening,
increased transvalvular gradient, onset of myocardial hypertrophy, in addition to
dilation of ascending aorta. With early surgical prescription, we prevent phenomena
acquired involved with valvular stenosis, which certainly place a greater risk of
evolution.</p>
