  <body>
    <p>Peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis (PPS) is a rare congenital heart disease in which one or
more narrowed segments are formed in the main or peripheral pulmonary arteries [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although pulmonary stenosis has been previously
reported in cats [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], PPS is extremely rare [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We are aware of only 9 reported cases in cats [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], of which one was successfully treated by balloon
angioplasty [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; however, to our knowledge, medical
treatment of cats with PPS has not previously been reported. In this report, we describe the
clinical courses of 3 cats with PPS and our observation of a reduced pressure gradient (PG)
through the stenosis in two of the cats medicated with atenolol.</p>
    <p><italic>Case 1</italic>: A 4-month-old intact male Somali cat, weighing 2.04 kg, was referred
to our hospital for further evaluation of a heart murmur. He had no clinical signs and had not
been medicated. A continuous grade V/VI murmur was auscultated, with maximal intensity heard
over the left heart base. A bounding pulse was palpated in both femoral arteries. Global heart
enlargement and enlarged pulmonary vessels, indicating pulmonary overcirculation, were
revealed on the thoracic radiograph.</p>
    <p>Echocardiography showed an increased left ventricular diastolic diameter and a left
ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVDd) of 28.0 mm (reference range, 11.0&#x2013;19.0 mm [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed left atrium
enlargement with a left atrial/aortic root ratio (LA/Ao) of 2.14 (reference range,&lt;1.5
[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). Color-flow Doppler revealed a left-to-right
patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Two-dimensional and color-flow Doppler echocardiographic images in 3 cats with PPS. (A)
Right parasternal short-axis view at the level of the aorta in Case 1 at first
presentation. PPS was suspected, but not identified due to retrograde flow from the PDA.
(B) Right parasternal short-axis view at the level of the aorta depicting bilateral

stenosis; PDA: patent ductus arteriosus; AO: aorta; MPA: main pulmonary artery; RPA:
right pulmonary artery; LPA: left pulmonary artery; DA: ductus arteriosus.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-487-g001"/></fig>). Color flow and spectral Doppler echocardiography also revealed a turbulent flow from
the main pulmonary artery (MPA) to the right pulmonary artery (RPA), with a velocity of 4.40
m/sec and a pressure gradient (PG) through the stenosis of 77.4 mmHg. However, this could not
be differentiated from the retrograde flow of the PDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.
1A</xref>). Enalapril (0.5 mg/kg per os (PO) every (q) 24 hr) was prescribed, because of
left ventricular volume overload.</p>
    <p>At 6 days after first presentation, we attempted to close the ductus arteriosus using coil
embolization; however, it was too wide for the coil device (Type III [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]), so we elected to perform a surgical correction. At this time,
peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis was suspected based on angiography, although the image
and pressure data of the MPA were lacking. After completing the angiography study, a
thoracotomy was performed via the left fourth intercostal space under general anesthesia, and
the ductus arteriosus was routinely ligated with silk sutures. A systolic grade III/IV heart
murmur remained after surgery, with maximal intensity heard over the left heart base.</p>
    <p>At 28 days after first presentation, the LVDd had decreased to 16.7 mm on M-mode
echocardiography. However, a turbulent flow with a left pulmonary artery (LPA) velocity of
4.64 m/sec (estimated PG, 86.1 mmHg) and an RPA velocity of 4.03 m/sec (estimated PG, 65.0
mmHg) were revealed on color flow and spectral Doppler echocardiography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1B</xref>). In addition, a slight flattening of the intraventricular
septum (IVS) following a pressure-loaded right ventricle (RV) was subjectively observed in
end-systole on two-dimensional echocardiography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig.
2A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Echocardiographic images before and after atenolol treatment in Case 1 (A) and Case 2
(B, C). In Case 1, flattening of the IVS was observed before atenolol treatment on
two-dimensional echocardiography (A top, arrows, at 28 days after first presentation).
The flattening of the IVS was resolved at 854 days after first presentation (A bottom),
although, the atenolol treatment had been discontinued by the owner for 10 months. In
Case 2, IVS flattening was observed at 35 days after first presentation (B top, dotted
arrow). The velocity of the LPA decreased from 4.75 m/sec (C top, estimated PG, 90.3
mmHg; at 35 days after fist presentation) to 3.27 m/sec (C bottom, estimated PG, 42.8
mmHg; at 70 days after first presentation) according to atenolol treatment, though the
flattening of the IVS remained at 70 days after first presentation (B bottom). RV: right
ventricle; LV: left ventricle.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-487-g002"/></fig>) [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
    <p>Case 1 was diagnosed as bilateral PPS. Because of the flattened IVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2A</xref>), a high-pressure gradient through the stenosis was suspected
[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and the cat was treated with atenolol (1 mg/kg PO
q 24 hr). At 86 days after the first presentation, the owner complained that the cat exhibited
exercise intolerance after atenolol treatment, although at this time, the velocity of the RPA
had decreased to 3.35 m/sec (estimated PG, 44.9 mmHg) on spectral Doppler echocardiography
(LPA velocity was not available). The dose of atenolol was decreased to 0.5 mg/kg q 24 hr,
because of the exercise intolerance complaint. The owner reported resolution of the exercise
intolerance problem after the atenolol dose was reduced, although the relationship to atenolol
was unclear. Enalapril was withdrawn, because of reverse-remodeling of the left ventricle.</p>
    <p>At 854 days after first presentation, the velocity of the LPA was 2.42 m/sec (estimated PG,
23.4 mmHg) and the flattening of the IVS disappeared on echocardiography, although the owner
had stopped the administration of atenolol 10 months prior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Thereafter, annual follow-up was continued without atenolol treatment. At
the time of manuscript preparation (2,225 days after first presentation), the cat&#x2019;s clinical
status was good, and there were no clinical signs associated with PPS.</p>
    <p><italic>Case 2</italic>: A 1-year-old neutered male Norwegian Forest cat, weighing 4.52 kg,
was referred to our hospital for further evaluation of a heart murmur. He had no clinical
signs and had not been medicated. A grade IV/VI systolic heart murmur was auscultated with
maximal intensity heard over the left heart base. An electrocardiogram revealed a sinus rhythm
with a heart rate of 174 beats/min. The QRS complex, which was negative in lead I and positive
in both leads aVR and aVL, indicated right axis deviation (mean electrical axis, &#x2212;150&#xB0;;
reference range, 0&#xB0; to 160&#xB0;). Thoracic radiography showed no abnormal findings.</p>
    <p>Color flow and spectral Doppler echocardiography revealed turbulent flow from the MPA to both
the RPA (3.66 m/sec; estimated PG, 53.6 mmHg) and LPA (the velocity was not available). The
maximum right atrial diameter and left atrial diameter ratio (RAD/LAD) was 1.02 (reference
range&lt;1.0 [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). However, the RAD/LAD was 1.46 at 35
days after first presentation. In addition, flattening of the IVS was observed in end-systole
on the right parasternal short-axis view at the level of the chordae tendineae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Color flow and spectral Doppler
echocardiography revealed a turbulent flow from the MPA to the LPA, with a velocity of 4.75
m/sec (estimated PG, 90.3 mmHg; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Figs. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">2C</xref>), although it could not be measured at first
presentation.</p>
    <p>Case 2 was diagnosed with bilateral PPS. Because the IVS was flattened, a high-pressure
gradient through the stenosis was suspected, and the cat was treated with atenolol (6.25
mg/head PO q 12 hr). The velocity of the LPA decreased to 3.27 m/sec (estimated PG, 42.8 mmHg;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2C</xref>) at 70 days after first presentation,
although, flattening of the IVS remained. The RAD/LAD was 1.18. A serum biochemistry panel
revealed elevated creatinine (2.2 mg/d<italic>l</italic>; reference range, 0.8&#x2013;1.8
mg/d<italic>l</italic>) at 467 days after first presentation. The atenolol dose was
decreased to 3.125 mg/head q 12 hr, because the blood atenolol level may have increased due to
a decreased glomerular filtration rate [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
    <p>At 672 days after first presentation, the velocities of both RPA and LPA were 3.07 m/sec
(estimated PG, 37.7 mmHg) on spectral Doppler echocardiography. Serum creatinine level had
decreased to 1.2 mg/d<italic>l</italic>, although the relationship with the dosage of atenolol
was unclear. Semi-annual follow-up was continued. At the time of manuscript preparation (1,229
days after first presentation), the cat&#x2019;s clinical status was good, and there were no clinical
signs associated with PPS.</p>
    <p><italic>Case 3</italic>: A 6-month-old intact female American Curl cat, weighing 2.06 kg, was
referred to our hospital for further evaluation of a heart murmur, which was detected before
sterilization at a referring veterinary hospital. She had no clinical signs and had not been
medicated. A grade IV/VI systolic heart murmur was auscultated with its maximal intensity
heard over the left heart base. Radiography showed right atrium enlargement. An
electrocardiogram revealed a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 241 beats/min. The mean
electrical axis was within the normal range (106&#xB0;), although the QRS complex was negative in
lead I.</p>
    <p>Color and spectral Doppler echocardiography revealed turbulent flows from the MPA to both the
RPA (3.40 m/sec; estimated PG, 46.2 mmHg) and LPA (2.90 m/sec; estimated PG, 33.6 mmHg)
without right ventricular hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1D</xref>).
Case 3 was diagnosed with bilateral PPS; only annual follow-up was planned. At the time of
manuscript preparation (522 days after first presentation), the cat has remained in good
clinical condition without clinical signs associated with PPS.</p>
    <p>PPS is a rare congenital cardiovascular heart disease in veterinary as well as human
medicine; it is found in only 2&#x2013;3% of humans with congenital heart disease [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. There are
few reports of congenital PPS in the veterinary literature. We are aware of 10 reported cases:
1 in a dog with bilateral pulmonary artery stenosis [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], 1 in a cat with right pulmonary branch stenosis who underwent successful balloon
angioplasty [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], 7 in cats with isolated stenosis of
the main pulmonary artery [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and 1 in a cat
concurrently affected with PDA and juxtaductal coarctation of both pulmonary arteries [<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
    <p>In Case 1, the following etiologies are possible causes of PPS: 1) the LPA may have been
compressed by a tubular aneurysm secondary to an enlarged ductus arteriosus, since acquired
pulmonary stenosis has reportedly followed aortic aneurysms in humans [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and the ductus arteriosus was
anatomically close to the LPA; 2) the LPA was inadvertently occluded at the time of PDA
ligation [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] or compressed by a suture granuloma
secondary to the silk used to ligate the PDA; 3) tissue from the ductus arteriosus migrated to
the pulmonary artery, and stenosis occurred when the migrated tissue contracted after birth
[<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; or 4) the proximal sixth left and right aortic
arches, which connect to the ipsilateral pulmonary artery, were abnormally atrophied as an
embryologic developmental abnormality [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Inadvertent ligation of the LPA was ruled out, because
hypovascularity was not recognized in the left lung field on thoracic radiography after the
surgery [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Compression of the LPA due to a tubular
aneurysm secondary to a large PDA appeared unlikely, because similar cases of large tubular
aneurysms secondary to PDA concurrent with pulmonary hypertension did not have PPS before or
after surgery [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A granuloma due to the silk materials
used for PDA ligation is undeniable; however, aberrant involution of the proximal sixth aortic
arch and/or ectopic ductus arteriosus tissue are possible causes of PPS in all 3 cats in the
present report, because both pulmonary arteries were affected, as described in previous
reports [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
    <p>The symptomatic cat with PPS had been reported to have had recurrent episodes of dyspnea,
which was purportedly due to right pulmonary branch stenosis and subtotal left pulmonary
atresia [<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In humans with PPS, exertional dyspnea
caused by pulmonary hypoperfusion is one of the most common clinical symptoms [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, clinical signs are uncommon in the cats with
PPS [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our 3 cases, even Case 1 with concurrent PDA,
had no clinical signs secondary to heart disease.</p>
    <p>In humans with PPS, transcatheter or surgical treatments are conducted with the following
indications: 1) the right ventricular pressure is over two-thirds the systemic pressure; 2)
pulmonary blood flow distribution is inadequate after other cardiac abnormalities are
corrected; 3) the pulmonary artery is distorted in symptomatic patients with or without
cardiopulmonary shunts; 4) pulmonary blood flow has marked asymmetry; or 5) segmental
pulmonary artery hypertension is present, i.e., the mean distal pressure is over 25 mmHg
[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Transcatheter treatments are the first line
therapy in humans with PPS, because the results of surgical treatment have been unsatisfactory
[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Indeed,
it has been previously reported that balloon angioplasty was helpful even in a cat with PPS
[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; however, to the authors&#x2019; knowledge, there are
few reports of medical treatment for PPS in the veterinary medicine.</p>
    <p>Atenolol is a selective beta-1 receptor antagonist, which has anti-ischemic, negative
chronotropic, negative inotropic and anti-arrhythmogenic properties, and is believed to reduce
myocardial oxygen consumption [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It is also empirically used for pulmonary artery stenosis in
veterinary medicine [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the clinical evidence for its efficacy in this situation is lacking.
It has been reported that the PG significantly decreased in humans with dynamic left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction (DLVOTO) during treatment with atenolol [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, regression of left ventricular
hypertrophy was observed in young dogs with DLVOTO treated with atenolol [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], although DLVOTO resolved without atenolol as the dogs
grew, i.e., there were anatomical changes within the heart as it grew into its adult form
[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the present report, PG through the stenosis
decreased in 2 cats that were medicated with atenolol, although the PG remained low after
atenolol was withdrawn in Case 1. In Case 1, hypercontraction of the left ventricle secondary
to volume overload due to PDA might have affected the contraction of the right ventricle and
the increasing PG [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition, maturation might
have affected the degree of stenosis in Case 1, as described in humans with PPS [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, treatment with atenolol might not be required
in all PPS cases. The indications for atenolol treatment in cats with PPS should be
established.</p>
    <p>A standard dosage of atenolol cannot be based on our report; however, a lower dosage of
atenolol (0.5&#x2013;0.69 mg/kg, q 12&#x2013;24 hr) appeared to be sufficient to reduce the PG through the
stenosis. However, atenolol has not prolonged survival time in obstructive heart disease
cases, e.g. subaortic stenosis in dogs [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and DLVOTO in
cats with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].
In addition, decreasing the PG secondary to surgical correction [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] or balloon valvuloplasty [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] might not prolong survival time in severe
subaortic stenosis. Therefore, atenolol might not prolong survival time in cats with PPS,
although it might decrease the PG through the stenosis, and reducing the PG followed by
balloon angioplasty has been shown to alleviate clinical symptoms in a cat with PPS [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and was effective in cats with infundibular pulmonary
stenosis without heart failure [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, the
prognosis for cats with PPS might be benign with or without medical treatments, as previously
reported [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and supported by the current cases in
which all 3 cats survived without clinical signs over 1.5 to 7 years after diagnosis.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, PPS can occur concurrently with PDA. The clinical signs with pulmonary
hypoperfusion, e.g. exercise intolerance and exertional dyspnea, are not common in cats. The
degrees of stenosis with PPS might improve as the cats mature. The prognosis appears to be
good in cats with PPS. Although the PG through the stenosis might decrease after the atenolol
treatment, further studies are required to determine the appropriate dosage of atenolol and
elucidate the survival advantage of its use in cats with PPS.</p>
