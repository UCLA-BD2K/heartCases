      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cobalamin (Cbl) is an essential vitamin for human health.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Due to its pivotal role in both deoxyribonucleic acid and fatty acid synthesis, the neurological presentations of Cbl deficiency are diverse and may present with variable severity.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> While an increasing body of evidence supports the negative impact of Cbl deficiency on cognition,<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> the causality has yet to be determined, and the reported therapeutic responses after Cbl supplement therapy have been inconsistent.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Some studies have reported disease severity<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> and baseline levels of methylmalonic acid<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> to be predictors of the prognosis. However, few reports have described neuroimaging characteristics associated with the therapeutic response. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe and compare technetium-99m ethyl cysteinate dimer single-photon emission computed tomography (Tc-99m-ECD SPECT) findings in 2 patients with Cbl deficiency with distinct therapeutic responses. Institutional review board approval was waived, as this is a retrospective case report with no identifying patient information presented. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients for the publication of this case report. A copy of the written consents is available for review by the editor of this journal.</p>

      <title>Case reports</title>
      <p>Case 1: A 74-year-old woman who had been a vegan for more than 10 years presented with a slowly progressive dull response and forgetfulness for 1 year. Except for a history of well-controlled hypertension, she had no history of diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, and cigarette consumption. Neurological examinations showed normal gait and deep tendon reflex throughout. Her serum Cbl level was 199&#x200A;pg/mL (lower limit: 250&#x200A;pg/mL) and homocysteine level was 19.14&#x200A;&#x3BC;mol/L (upper limit: 17.2&#x200A;&#x3BC;mol/L). Her serum low-density lipoprotein was 99&#x200A;mg/dL (upper limit: 100&#x200A;mg/dL); total cholesterol level was 167&#x200A;mg/dL (upper limit: 200&#x200A;mg/dL); glycated hemoglobin was 5.3% (upper limit: 5.6%); creatinine was 0.8&#x200A;mg/dL (upper limit: 1.0&#x200A;mg/dL); folic acid was 7.88&#x200A;ng/mL (lower limit: 3.0&#x200A;ng/mL). Other serology profiles relevant to depression and/or dementia including thyroid function and levels of cortisol were unremarkable. She scored 12/30 and 34/100 on the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and cognitive abilities screening instrument (CASI), respectively, which were far below average (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Profound deficits in mental manipulation, drawing, short-term/long-term memory, and verbal fluency were noted. The total score of Neuropsychiatric Inventory was 2, resulted from a mild change in the subdomain of depression/dysphoria (frequency&#x200A;&#xD7;&#x200A;severity = 2&#x200A;&#xD7;&#x200A;1; mildly associated caregiver distress). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed only small periventricular caps (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A) and mild senile atrophy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B); the magnetic resonance angiography showed patent major intracranial arteries. Tc-99m-ECD SPECT showed widespread hypoperfusion in bilateral frontotemporal regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). Cerebral perfusion within the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A and C) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A to C) was markedly impaired, presenting as ragged and discontinuous signals. Both dorsolateral and medial portions of the PFC were affected, and hypoperfusion within the bilateral thalamus and the left basal ganglia was also noted. She was diagnosed as having dementia due to Cbl deficiency. Her serum Cbl level normalized to 449&#x200A;pg/mL 5 months after Cbl supplement therapy (cyanocobalamin 1500&#x200A;ug/d). Although follow-up Tc-99m-ECD SPECT showed mild improvements in bilateral temporal cortices (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D), signal recovery within the ACC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D and F) and PFC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D to F) was limited, consistent with no improvements in neuropsychological test scores (follow-up MMSE: 11/30, CASI: 39/100) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). At the last retest performed 1 year later, there was no further deterioration in her cognitive performance (MMSE: 12/30, CASI: 38/100). She did not take any antidepressants/acetylcholinesterase inhibitors but antihypertensives and Cbl supplement during the whole follow-up period.</p>

      <p>Case 2: A 61-year-old woman who had been a vegetarian for 5 years presented with insidious-onset of progressive memory complaints for 1 year. Aside from her cognitive complaints, she did not experience any sensation changes of limbs or gait problems. Except for age, she was free from risk factors of cerebrovascular disease that are commonly identified (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, and cigarette consumption). Her serum Cbl level was 207&#x200A;pg/mL, in association with an elevation of homocysteine level (17.50&#x200A;&#x3BC;mol/L; upper limit: 17.2&#x200A;&#x3BC;mol/L). Laboratory data aiming on cerebrovascular risk assessment and cognitive deficits, including lipid profiles, glycated hemoglobin, creatinine, folic acid, thyroid function, and cortisol level, were all within reference ranges. She scored 24/30 on the MMSE and 78/100 on the CASI, mainly due to impaired mental manipulation and abstract thinking (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Borderline performance in short-term memory and verbal fluency were also noted. The total score of Neuropsychiatric Inventory was 2, resulted from a small change in the subdomain of sleep and nighttime behavior disorders (frequency&#x200A;&#xD7;&#x200A;severity = 2&#x200A;&#xD7;&#x200A;1; minimally associated caregiver distress). Tc-99m-ECD SPECT was performed due to the absence of obvious atrophy or vascular lesions in brain MRI (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A and B). Although mildly impaired radio uptake was noted in bilateral frontal&#x2013;temporal cortices (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A), cerebral perfusion within the ACC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A and C) and PFC was relatively preserved (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A and B). Additionally, there was hypoperfusion within the bilateral thalamus. She was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment due to Cbl deficiency. Her Cbl level normalized (687&#x200A;pg/mL) 5 months after the same Cbl supplement therapy as Case 1. Follow-up SPECT showed avid global improvements (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D), including a remarkable signal reversal within the PFC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D and E) and ACC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D and F), consistent with favorable clinical recovery (follow-up MMSE: 28/30, CASI: 85/100) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Of note, her initial deficits in short-term memory completely reversed.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The aim of these case reports is to describe and compare Tc-99m-ECD SPECT findings in 2 patients with Cbl deficiency but distinct therapeutic responses. The findings showed changes in cerebral perfusion along with cognitive performance, and localized signal reversal after supplement therapy. Differentiating Tc-99m-ECD SPECT patterns according to the therapeutic responses may assist in identifying potential biomarkers associated with prognosis and pathogenesis. Both patients had hypoperfusion within the frontal&#x2013;temporal regions before treatment, and the extent and severity of this hypofrontality were likely responsible for the unfavorable prognosis. Specifically, radio uptake within both PFC and ACC may be considered to be a biomarker associated with therapeutic response. The principal activity of the PFC is orchestration of thought and action in accordance with internal goals.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Its dynamic filtering mechanism, a prerequisite for executive function, has been implicated in goal-directed activations and irrelevant noise inhibition.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Relevant widespread projections from the PFC are global and have a vital impact on cognition. The ACC is also considered to be a highly influential region for cognition, as it integrates neuronal connectivity of both frontosubcortical circuits and the limbic system.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Therefore, advanced cognitive decline may develop as metabolic derangements of the ACC lead to dysfunction over the frontal-temporal regions through a mechanism of diaschisis. Our Tc-99m-ECD SPECT findings also highlight the role of the frontotemporal regions in cognition, as both of our cases showed impaired performance in memory and verbal fluency.</p>
      <p>Cbl deficiency may contribute to cognitive decline through several mechanisms. First, symmetric and widespread hypometabolism within the frontal&#x2013;temporal regions supports that Cbl deficiency impairs baseline cerebral metabolic tone. Given that Cbl plays a pivotal role in methylation and DNA synthesis,<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Cbl deficiency potentially compromises the integrity of cellular membranes and energy reserve of neurons. Moreover, monoamine neurotransmitter production may also be affected, as Cbl stimulates tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis, an important pathway for monoamine synthesis.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Second, Cbl deficiency may impair cerebral perfusion via elevated levels of homocysteine, which has been reported to have a vasculotoxic effect.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Although both cases showed hyperhomocysteinemia, the initial level of serum homocysteine in <italic>Case 1</italic> appeared to be higher than <italic>Case 2</italic>. In view of a priori knowledge related to homocysteine,<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> the baseline serum level of homocysteine might possibly reflect the severity of its downstream oxidative stress. As <italic>Case 1</italic> still had progressive mental decline and limited signal reversal from the Tc-99m-ECD SPECT despite Cbl supplement, it seems that a relatively longer deficient state would cause irreversible degradation from the viewpoint of neuronal metabolism. In addition, the derangement of metabolic and microstructural changes may cause downstream dysfunction of ion channels and second messengers as well as neuronal membrane instability,<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> contributing to profound cognitive deficits in the absence of structural changes in brain parenchyma.</p>
      <p>Some may speculate the possibility that our patients had coexisting neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease or vascular dementia. However, we believe that such possibility was less likely. From a clinical viewpoint, the initial cognitive deficits of both cases went far beyond structural changes in brain MRI. The volumes of the medial temporal lobes were visually regarded to be nearly normal in terms of their age. In addition, both cases had minimal white matter changes in conventional brain MRI, which we presumed to have a limited impact on cognition. Although <italic>Case 1</italic> showed no apparent improvement after Cbl supplement therapy, a relatively stationary cognitive performance during long-term follow-up supported that her cognitive deficits were primarily due to low Cbl status. Furthermore, <italic>Case 2</italic> benefited remarkably from Cbl supplement therapy. The domain-specific improvement in short-term memory was very different from the therapeutic response expected in Alzheimer disease, where benefits from acetylcholinesterase inhibitors mainly result in attention, executive, language, and visuospatial function.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> From a neuroradiological viewpoint, the symmetric hypoperfusion within the frontal&#x2013;temporal regions on SPECT represents a distinct pattern from Alzheimer disease-related pathology. Previous studies have validated that radio-uptake in the precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, and parietal and medial temporal lobes are most commonly impaired in patients with Alzheimer disease.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Another recent SPECT report of mild cognitive impairment investigated the earlier stage and identified asymmetric hypoperfusion over the hippocampus in association with amnestic subtypes of mild cognitive impairment.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Taken together, the Tc-99m-ECD SPECT findings in the current cases corroborate that the fundamental pathogenesis of Cbl deficiency-related cognitive decline is different from Alzheimer disease.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Our Tc-99m-ECD SPECT findings highlight the negative impact of Cbl deficiency on cerebral perfusion/metabolism. While symmetric hypoperfusion within the frontal&#x2013;temporal regions was present in both cases, the severity of hypofrontality was correlated with cognitive performance before and after treatment. Signal integrity alongside the PFC and ACC may predict preservation of global cognitive function in patients with Cbl deficiency.</p>
