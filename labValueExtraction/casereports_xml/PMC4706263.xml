        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma (FDCS) is a neoplasm that arises from follicular dendritic cells. FDCSs originating in the abdomen are extremely rare. Clinically, they often mimic a wide variety of other abdominal tumors, and correct preoperative diagnosis is often a challenging task. To date, only scattered cases of abdominal FDCS have been reported and few data are available on their radiological features. Here we present the computer tomography imaging findings of 5 patients with surgically and pathologically demonstrated abdominal FDCS.</p>
        <p>An abdominal FDCS should be included in the differential diagnosis when single or multiple masses with relatively large size, well- or ill-defined borders, complex internal architecture with marked internal necrosis and/or focal calcification, and heterogeneous enhancement with &#x201C;rapid wash-in and slow wash-out&#x201D; or &#x201C;progressive enhancement&#x201D; enhancement patterns in the solid component are seen.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Follicular dendritic cells are nonlymphoid, nonphagocytic, antigen-presenting cells of the immune system.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Their main functions are to capture, process, and present antigens and immune complexes to B- and T-cells.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma (FDCS) is a neoplasm that arises from these follicular dendritic cells, and this rare primary neoplasm was first recognized in 1986 by Monda et al<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>; since then, approximately 200 cases of FDCS have been reported in the English language literature.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The majority of cases have been observed in the lymph nodes, particularly in the cervical lymph nodes and occasionally in the axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes. Approximately one-third of the reported cases have been located in an extranodal site.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The abdominal region is thought to be one of the relative preferred sites of extranodal FDCS.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Clinically, they often mimic a wide variety of other abdominal tumors, and correct preoperative diagnosis is often a challenging task.</p>
      <p>To date, only scattered cases of abdominal FDCS have been reported in the English literature, most of which were case reports<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>; these reports have mainly focused on pathological and clinical features.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> To the best of our knowledge, there have been only a few studies describing the imaging features of abdominal FDCS.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> We therefore retrospectively reviewed the computed tomography (CT) findings of 5 patients with surgically and pathologically demonstrated abdominal FDCS.</p>

        <title>Patient Data</title>
        <p>The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. Five cases of FDCS confirmed by surgery and pathology were collected from our 2 hospitals from January 2006 to July 2015. All 5 patients had undergone a complete or partial surgical resection of their tumor, and the resection specimens were collected and analyzed at 2 central pathology laboratories. The definitive diagnosis of FDCS was established by histological and immunohistochemical evaluations. The medical records, including a history of the disease, radiologic imaging, and pathological data for all 5 patients, were retrieved for retrospective analysis.</p>

      <sec sec-type="methods">
        <title>Equipment and Methods</title>
        <p>CT examinations were performed at 4 spiral CT scanners (Aquilion 16, Toshiba Medical system, Otawara, Japan, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;2; Brilliance iCT256, Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;1; LightSpeed 16, GE Health Care, Milwaukee, WI, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;1; Dual Source CT, Somatom Definition, Siemens Medical Systems, Forchheim, Germany; n&#x200A;=&#x200A;1). All 5 patients underwent noncontrast- and contrast-enhanced CT scans. The scan parameters were as follows: 2 to 5&#x200A;mm slice thickness reconstructions, 23&#x200A;cm field of view, 120&#x200A;kV voltage, 200 to 300&#x200A;mA current, and 256&#x200A;&#xD7;&#x200A;256 matrix. An intravenous bolus dose of 80 to 100&#x200A;mL of a nonionic iodine contrast agent (iopromide; Ultravist; Schering) was injected into the antecubital vein at a rate of 2.5 to 3.0&#x200A;mL/s to the patients who underwent contrast-enhanced CT. Multiphase enhancement images, including arterial, venous, and delayed-phase studies, were obtained at 25 to 35, 60 to 70, and 180 to 300 seconds after the initiation of intravenous contrast agent injections.</p>

        <title>Image Analysis</title>
        <p>Two experienced abdominal radiologists retrospectively reviewed all the CT images in consensus. The CT imaging characteristics were analyzed with particular attention to the lesion location, shape, size, number, margins, attenuation in the unenhanced and enhanced CT images, enhancement patterns of the tumor, and the tumor-spread patterns (including local invasion, lymph node, and distant metastasis). The attenuation on unenhanced CT images was classified as low, moderate, or high with relative to the adjacent tissues. The degree of enhancement was evaluated objectively by the change in the CT values and categorized as none, mild, moderate, or marked. In addition, the presence of any calcification or necrosis within the lesion was also recorded.</p>

        <title>Clinical Information</title>
        <p>The study group included 4 males and 1 female, with a mean age of 60 years (range, 55&#x2013;70 years). Two patients were asymptomatic and were found incidentally. Two had complained of recurrent or persisting and increasing abdominal discomfort, which included abdominal pain and abdominal fullness, with symptom durations of 1 month and 5 years, respectively. The remaining patient complained of right upper abdominal pain with 1 month's duration combined with fever for 6 days. Routine laboratory tests revealed that the patient who had a fever showed elevated white cell counts. The results of routine laboratory tests for the remaining 4 patients revealed no significant abnormalities. Serum tumor marker examinations, including CEA (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;5), CA199 (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;5), and CA724 (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;3), were performed, and none of these revealed any significant abnormalities in the 5 patients to whom they were administered.</p>

        <title>CT Findings</title>
        <p>The CT findings of all 5 patients are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Two cases were single tumors (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and 3 cases (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) showed multiple tumors, with 8 tumors in total. All tumors were located within the intra-abdominal region and/or the retroperitoneum. The tumors ranged from 5.3 to 17.1&#x200A;cm (average 9.6&#x200A;cm) in the largest diameter. All tumors were ovoid (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;5), lobulated (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;2), or irregular (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;1), with well-defined (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;5) or partially ill-defined margins (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;3).</p>

Intratumoral serpentine feeding arteries or peritumoral draining veins were observed in 2 lesions (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). Six lesions presented with patchy or irregular nonenhanced areas during enhanced phases, which suggests necrotic components.</p>
        <p>Local invasion was noted in 3 tumors. Tumor 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A&#x2013;E) surrounded and encased the left kidney, the renal artery, and the vein of the left renal hilum, with widespread involvement of the adjacent perirenal fascia and peritoneum. It was accompanied by renal vein and inferior vena cava thrombus. Tumors 3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>F) and 4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A&#x2013;E) involved the left psoas muscle and duodenal bulb, respectively.

        <title>Pathological Findings</title>
        <p>Six tumors in 4 cases were completely surgically resected. Two tumors in 1 patient (case 2) had extensive infiltration and only underwent excision biopsy. Macroscopically, the 6 complete resected lesions were oval or irregular, with a complete or partial capsule. Microscopically, the tumor was composed of proliferations of spindled to ovoid cells, with a variety of growth patterns including whorled, storiform, fascicular, and nodular, associated with lymphocyte-rich stromas (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>H). Giant cells and mitotic figures were identified occasionally. Irregular hemorrhage and/or coagulative necrosis were observed in all cases. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that the tumors were positive for CD21 (4/4), CD35 (4/4), CD23 (4/4), CD68 (2/4), Vimentin (4/4), BCL-2 (3/3), S-100 (1/5), EMA (1/5), and CD34 (1/5) in each instance where they were applied.</p>

        <title>Follow-Up</title>
        <p>Two of 5 patients underwent chemotherapy followed by surgery. One of them (case 4) went into remission during the 11-month follow-up period after the surgery. Another patient (case 1) had metastases develop in the liver 4 months later (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>G). For the remaining 3 patients, 1 patient (case 3) who underwent surgery without chemotherapy remained disease-free for 2 months. The other 2 were lost to follow-up.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Extranodal FDCS was first reported by Chan et al in 1994.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Since then, the spectrum of FDCS in extranodal sites has greatly expanded to include locations throughout the body.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The more predominant extranodal sites for tumor involvement include the tonsils, pharyngeal region, thyroid, mediastinum, intra-abdominal, and the retroperitoneum.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Histologically, the most commonly identified feature of this entity is the presence of oval to spindle cells with elongated nuclei, delicate, dispersed chromatin, and pale eosinophilic cytoplasm.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Immunohistochemically, FDCS cells generally share the immunophenotype of non-neoplastic FDCs, and positive staining of CD21, CD35, and CD23 was particularly useful for the final diagnosis of FDC.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Extranodal FDCS can present between 9 and 82 years of age (mean age, 46 years) and has a slight female predominance (female-to-male ratio, 77:65).<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> FDCSs originating in the abdomen are rare.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Because of their scarceness and the limited number of reports, the exact incidence of these entities is still unknown. In the current case series of abdominal FDCS, the ages of the patients were in the range of 55 to 70 years (mean age, 60 years), and there was an obvious predilection for females, with a female-to-male ratio of 4:1. Clinically, most patients were asymptomatic or presented with abdominal fullness, abdominal pain, or symptoms related to the compression of adjacent structures.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The serum tumor marker examinations (including CEA, CA199, and CA724) performed in the present study showed no specificity.</p>
      <p>Various sites of FDCS originating from the abdomen have been reported, including the liver,<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> spleen,<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> pancreas,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> adrenal gland,<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> gastrointestinal tract,<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> retroperitoneum,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> mesentery,<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> omentum,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and abdominal wall.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Abdominal FDCS has been reported to tend to manifest larger-sized tumors than those outside the abdomen and exhibited an average tumor size of 10.2&#x200A;cm (range, 3&#x2013;22&#x200A;cm).<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Our findings were in accordance with these observation.</p>
      <p>CT imaging features aid in making correct diagnoses before treatment when a neoplasm is detected. In the few published reports,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> abdominal FDCS has been described as a discrete mass with complex internal architecture, such as heterogeneous enhancement, marked by internal necrosis and focal calcification. In our cases, most lesions showed well- or partially ill-defined heterogeneous density tumors with soft-tissue parts and patchy or irregular low-attenuating areas. The soft-tissue parts corresponded histologically to the tumor's solid portion, and demonstrated heterogeneous enhancement on postcontrast CT scans. The low-attenuating areas that were correlated with necrosis and hemorrhage showed no enhancement. Frequent necrosis and/or hemorrhage observed in abdominal FDCS are thought to be related to the relatively large size of these tumors. Calcifications can be detected on unenhanced CTs in quite a few cases, and the pattern of calcifications has always been depicted as coarse and/or chunk-like in previous studies.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In our series, 50% (4/8) of all tumors also showed scattered coarse and/or chunk-like calcifications located centrally or eccentrically. These imaging findings described above are similar to those in previous reports and demonstrate that the internal necrosis and coarse and/or chunk-like descriptions may be relatively characteristic CT imaging features for diagnosing abdominal FDCS.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge, the enhancement patterns in multiphase CT imaging findings of abdominal FDCS have not been previously reported.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In the present series, the solid component of the tumors showed marked or moderate enhancement with &#x201C;rapid wash-in and slow wash-out&#x201D; or &#x201C;progressive enhancement&#x201D; patterns of enhancement during multiphase imaging. The finding of marked or moderate enhancement of all tumors in the present study is consistent with some previous studies.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In addition, serpentine feeding arteries and draining veins in and/or around the tumor were noted in 2 lesions. These findings suggest that abdominal FDCS may be relatively hypervascular, or at least not hypovascular, as has been reported previously in some mediastinal FDCSs.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The patterns of &#x201C;slow wash-out&#x201D; and &#x201C;progressive enhancement&#x201D; in the venous and delayed phases are thought to correlate with hypercellular density areas with proliferation of spindled to ovoid cells and to be associated with lymphocyte-rich stromas.</p>
      <p>Extranodal FDCSs are more aggressive than a low-grade soft tissue sarcoma, and they should at minimum be considered as an intermediate-grade malignancy.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> They often metastasize via the blood and the lymphatic system.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Lymph nodes, lung, and liver are the most common sites for metastasis.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Surgical resection for localized disease remains the mainstay of treatment, and the possible roles for adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy remain undefined.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The overall recurrence, metastasis, and mortality rates of extranodal FDCS cases were 49.2%, 21.5%, and 13.8%, respectively.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Differential diagnosis of FDCS in the abdomen region should include abdominal mesenchymal neoplasms such as leiomyosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosarcoma, gastrointestinal/extragastrointestinal stromal tumor and solitary fibrous tumor, and neurogenic tumors. Similarities on clinical imaging between the above tumors and FDCS are noted. Given the rarity of abdominal FDCS, prospective imaging diagnosis of this type of tumor can be challenging; all final diagnoses depend upon histopathological testing.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, abdominal FDCSs arising from the abdomen are rare, occurring predominantly in the middle-aged and elderly. During CT imaging, the possibility of FDCS should be considered when single or multiple masses originate from the intra-abdominal region and/or the retroperitoneum, with relatively larger sizes, complex internal architectures with marked internal necrosis and/or focal coarse and/or chunk-like calcifications, and heterogeneous enhancement with &#x201C;rapid wash-in and slow wash-out&#x201D; or &#x201C;progressive enhancement&#x201D; patterns of enhancement in the solid component. Regional lymphadenopathy is always noted.</p>
