      <abstract>
        <p>Antigen receptor signalling activates the canonical NF-&#x3BA;B pathway via the CARD11/BCL10/MALT1 (CBM) signalosome involving key, yet ill-defined roles for linear ubiquitination. The paracaspase MALT1 cleaves and removes negative checkpoint proteins, amplifying lymphocyte responses in NF-&#x3BA;B activation and in B-cell lymphoma subtypes. To identify new human MALT1 substrates, we compare B cells from the only known living <italic>MALT1</italic><sup><italic>mut/mut</italic></sup> patient with healthy <italic>MALT1</italic><sup>+/<italic>mut</italic></sup> family members using 10-plex Tandem Mass Tag TAILS N-terminal peptide proteomics. We identify HOIL1 of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex as a novel MALT1 substrate. We show linear ubiquitination at B-cell receptor microclusters and signalosomes. Late in the NF-&#x3BA;B activation cycle HOIL1 cleavage transiently reduces linear ubiquitination, including of NEMO and RIP1, dampening NF-&#x3BA;B activation and preventing reactivation. By regulating linear ubiquitination, MALT1 is both a positive and negative pleiotropic regulator of the human canonical NF-&#x3BA;B pathway&#x2014;first promoting activation via the CBM&#x2014;then triggering HOIL1-dependent negative-feedback termination, preventing reactivation.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Linear ubiquitin chains, assembled by peptide bond linkage of the ubiquitin Met1 &#x3B1;-amine to the C-terminal glycine of a proximal ubiquitin, are a recently recognized topographic form of polyubiquitination. This modification is highly associated with anti-inflammatory responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#x3BA;B) activation and protection from tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily-mediated apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Linear ubiquitination E3 ligase activity uniquely resides in heme-oxidized IRP2 ubiquitin ligase (HOIL1)-interacting protein (HOIP). Full HOIP activity requires HOIL1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) and Shank-associated RH domain interactor (SHARPIN)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> to activate and stabilize HOIP to form the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The linear chain deubiquitinase OTULIN also reversibly associates with HOIP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Tumour necrosis factor-, CD40L- and IL-1&#x3B2;-induced canonical NF-&#x3BA;B activation requires specific, high-affinity binding of NF-&#x3BA;B essential modulator (NEMO) to proteins modified by linear ubiquitin at cell membrane-anchored receptor signalosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Although the importance of LUBAC for NF-&#x3BA;B signalling is highlighted by germline and somatic mutations in LUBAC genes resulting in primary immunodeficiency diseases or in lymphomagenesis driven by NF-&#x3BA;B (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), HOIP catalytic activity can be dispensable for B-cell receptor signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Thus, regulation of LUBAC assembly, activity and inactivation remains ill defined.</p>
    <p>As a central regulator of innate and adaptive immunity, the NF-&#x3BA;B pathway integrates signals converging from a range of cell surface and intracellular pattern recognition receptors, leading to rapid nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-&#x3BA;B (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). A key convergence point in the NF-&#x3BA;B pathway is the CARD11/BCL10/MALT1 (CBM) signalosome, which consists of the caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 11 (CARD11), B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 10 (BCL10) and a cysteine protease, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1)&#x2014;the only human paracaspase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The CBM signalosome rapidly transduces receptor engagement to the canonical I&#x3BA;B kinase (IKK) complex, consisting of IKK&#x3B1;, IKK&#x3B2; and IKK&#x3B3;/NEMO subunits. Linear ubiquitination of NEMO is required for phosphorylation of I&#x3BA;B&#x3B1; by the IKK complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Phospho-I&#x3BA;B&#x3B1; is then rapidly Lys48-polyubiquitinated, initiating proteasomal degradation and allowing free NF-&#x3BA;B to translocate to the nucleus. Here it transcribes a tightly controlled program of proinflammatory genes and negative regulators of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The importance of the CBM in immunity is revealed by the profound disruption in T- and B-cell receptor signalling in human and mouse genetic deficiencies for all the CBM components<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p>
    <p>In addition to mediating essential protein scaffolding functions required for transducing NF-&#x3BA;B signalling, MALT1 indirectly enhances NF-&#x3BA;B signalling and cell responses by cleaving and inactivating a limited repertoire of proteins that downregulate the canonical NF-&#x3BA;B pathway including the NF-&#x3BA;B subunit RelB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> and two deubiquitinases, A20 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) and cylindromatosis protein (CYLD), which also cleaves linear ubiquitin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. In T-cell receptor responses MALT1 autoproteolytic cleavage promotes NF-&#x3BA;B signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, whereas cleavage of BCL10 regulates T-cell adhesion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The cleavage of two messenger RNA-binding proteins, the RNAse Regnase-1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) and Roquin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, stabilizes T-cell receptor-induced messenger RNAs. Although B-cell regulation by MALT1 is less understood, the functionality of the CBM executed by MALT1 proteolysis is evident in lymphomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Activated B-cell-type diffuse large B-cell lymphoma carrying activating oncogenic mutations in CARD11 or in the CD79a/b components of the B-cell receptor are associated with constitutive CBM preassembly and cleavage of MALT1 substrates, and chronic active B-cell receptor signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. MALT1 overexpression following gene amplification in splenic marginal zone lymphomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> or as a fusion protein with cellular inhibitor of apoptosis-2 (cIAP2) in extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> further highlights MALT1 as an important drug target for lymphoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.</p>
    <p>Recently, we described the only known living patient in the world with a genetic MALT1 deficiency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. This now 17-year-old girl presented with combined immunodeficiency associated with immune dysregulation caused by a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in <italic>MALT1</italic>. Heterozygous family members are healthy with no immunological disorders. The MALT1 mutation Trp580Ser breaks a key stabilizing contact of the MALT1 immunoglobulin and catalytic domains, resulting in lower levels of a less active and less stable MALT1-Trp580Ser mutant protein causing failure to activate NF-&#x3BA;B in the patient's T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Paradoxically, the patient displays constitutive autoinflammatory responses, particularly affecting her skin and gastrointestinal tract; indeed, she experienced clinical benefit using anti-inflammatory corticosteroids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, highlighting the gaps in our understanding of the role of MALT1 in human immunity. Access to human cells deficient in MALT1 provides a unique opportunity to identify new MALT1 substrates in an intact human system without experimental over- or under-expression. Using 10-plex Tandem Mass Tags (TMTs), we identify HOIL1 as a MALT1 substrate directly linking MALT1 paracaspase activity for the downregulation of linear ubiquitination and eventual cessation of NF-&#x3BA;B signalling in a negative-feedback mechanism.</p>

        <title>TAILS identification of HOIL1 as a new MALT1 substrate</title>
        <p>The search for MALT1 substrates has so far proven intractable by proteomics, in part due to fastidious MALT1 activation mechanisms requiring CBM assembly, and in part from a limited, yet key substrate repertoire that requires high-sensitivity proteomic approaches. MALT1 genetically deficient cells provided a unique opportunity to identify new substrates in an intact human system without experimental over- or under-expression. Immortalized B cells from the patient (<italic>MALT1</italic><sup><italic>mut/mut</italic></sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) had less MALT1 than from her heterozygous (<italic>MALT1</italic><sup>+/<italic>mut</italic></sup>) brother and mother, both before and after stimulation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin, a strong inducer of NF-&#x3BA;B (<italic>N</italic>=11; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). MALT1-Trp580Ser in <italic>MALT1</italic><sup><italic>mut/mut</italic></sup> B cells was associated with impaired NF-&#x3BA;B activation as evidenced by delayed and reduced proteasome degradation of I&#x3BA;B&#x3B1; and a &gt;50% loss of activated phospho (p)-p65 (<italic>N</italic>=12 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Consistent with the genetic pattern of homozygous disease inheritance, MALT1-Trp580Ser in the heterozygous cells did not behave as a dominant-negative protein in NF-&#x3BA;B activation.</p>
        <p>To identify new MALT1 substrates, we used terminal amine isotopic labelling of substrates (TAILS), a highly sensitive proteomics approach that enriches and identifies protease substrates simultaneously with their cleavage sites by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Isobaric 10-plex TMT labelling blocked protein natural and cleaved neo-N-terminal &#x3B1;-amines in lysate protein of resting and PMA/ionomycin-activated B cells. Following trypsin digestion, we simultaneously compared the TAILS-enriched B-cell N-terminomes from the patient (<italic>n</italic>=3) with her mother (<italic>n</italic>=1) and brother (<italic>n</italic>=1) as controls, without or with PMA/ionomycin stimulation for 2 and 4&#x2009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>) to increase cleaved substrate accumulation for detection. Enabled by the 10-plex TMT-labelling strategy, this was performed in a single mass spectrometric analysis to reduce experimental variability. We also quantified protein changes in the B-cell proteome by shotgun proteomics (that is, preTAILS analysis). We identified 7,498 unique acetylated or TMT-labelled N-terminal peptides (peptide false discovery rate (FDR)&#x2264;1%) in 3,772 proteins (protein FDR&#x2264;1%). Even before removing decoy peptides and false identifications (<italic>n</italic>=29), the data set had &#x2264;1 reverse hit per 1,000 peptide spectrum matches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
        <p>To identify high-confidence MALT1 substrates, we analysed TMT-labelled cleaved neo-N-termini by high-accuracy TMT reporter ion ratios using synchronous precursor selection (SPS)-MS/MS/MS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) to reduce peak interferences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Substrate winnowing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>) identified a MALT1-cleavage site at <sup>165</sup>Arg&#x2193;Gly<sup>166</sup> in HOIL1. The neo-N-terminal peptide <sup>166</sup>GPLEPGPPKPGVPQEPGR<sup>182</sup> identifying the C-terminal HOIL1-cleavage product was reproducibly identified in multiple peptide spectrum matches (<italic>n</italic>=10) in every experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Importantly, it was markedly increased after PMA/ionomycin stimulation and was always present in lower amounts in the <italic>MALT</italic><sup><italic>mut/mut</italic></sup> cells compared with the <italic>MALT1</italic><sup>+/<italic>mut</italic></sup> cells from both the brother and the mother (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). Finally, this cleavage site complies with the consensus site LXP/SR&#x2193;G of the known MALT1 substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). The abundance of the HOIL1 natural N terminus (<italic>n</italic>=5) from the TAILS data and a tryptic peptide lying immediately N terminal to the cleavage site from the preTAILS shotgun data (<italic>n</italic>=3; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b,c</xref>) was constant in all samples confirming that the increase in HOIL1 neo-N-terminal peptide was not merely due to differences in protein abundance after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Hence, with high-confidence TAILS identified HOIL1 as a new MALT1 substrate with <sup>162</sup>LQPR&#x2193;G<sup>166</sup> as the cleavage site.</p>
        <p>Previously described substrates of MALT1 were not identified. This may be explained by cell type specificity of certain protease-substrate interactions as we analyzed B cells, whereas Roquin and Regnase-1 are described in literature as substrates in T cell-specific processes, and LIMA1 and NF-&#x3BA;B-induced kinase (NIK) are lymphoma-enriched substrates. An alternative explanation is that several known substrates yield neo-N-termini unfavourable to mass spectrometry&#x2014;either they are too small (BCL10: TVSR) or too large (for example, A20: GEAYEPLAWNPEESTGGPHSAPPTAPSPFLFSETTAMKCR; RelB: GAASLSTVTLGPVAPPATPPPWGCPLGR; and CYLD:GVGDKGSSSHNKPKATGSTSDPGNR). Furthermore, posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation in the neo-N-terminal peptide region may cause mass shifts that render the peptides elusive to identification.</p>

        <title>MALT1 cleaves HOIL1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells</title>
        <p><italic>In vitro</italic> assays in kosmotropic salts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> confirmed HOIL1 as a MALT1 substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). A concentration-dependent single cleavage of C-terminal FLAG-tagged HOIL1 (57&#x2009;kDa) yielded products of the molecular weight predicted by TAILS&#x2014;a C-terminal 39-kDa (C-HOIL1) domain and an N-terminal 18-kDa domain (N-HOIL1). To validate cleavage in a cellular context, we established a CBM transfection system in which an active CBM signalosome was assembled in HEK293FT cells in the absence of receptor stimulation by coexpressing MALT1 with BCL10 and the active oncogenic Leu244Pro mutant of CARD11. Cleavage of known substrates A20, CYLD, BCL10 and RelB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a&#x2013;d</xref>) co-transfected with the CBM confirmed MALT1-dependent CBM activity. Complete HOIL1 cleavage by the CBM was shown by coexpressing HOIL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Cleavage was not due to excess levels of MALT1 as HOIL1 was also cleaved by endogenous MALT1 in HEK293FT cells, where endogenous BCL10 was sufficient to form an active CBM with transfected CARD11-Leu244Pro (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>). HOIL1 cleavage was dependent on MALT1 paracaspase activity&#x2014;it was not cleaved by the catalytic inactive MALT1-Cys464Ala mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, left). A second Arg-Gly bond in HOIL1 (<sup>180</sup>EPGR-G<sup>184</sup>) lacking the nonprime consensus sequence was not cleaved. Cleavage only occurred at <sup>165</sup>Arg&#x2193;Gly<sup>166</sup>, as a charge conserving HOIL1-Arg165Lys mutant was noncleavable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, right). The very minor amount of C-HOIL1 generated from mutant HOIL1-Arg165Lys is consistent with weak cleavage at a Lys&#x2193;Gly site in LIMA1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Thus, HOIL1 cleavage is site specific with no redundant cleavage by other proteases.</p>
        <p>The t(11;18)(q21;q21) chromosomal translocation is the most common translocation found in B-cell lymphomas arising from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. This translocation creates the fusion protein cIAP2-MALT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), which exhibits MALT1 proteolytic activity without requiring CBM assembly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Constitutively, active cIAP2-MALT1 fusion protein leads to the cleavage of NIK<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> and LIMA1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>), and acts as an oncogenic driver. Transfected cIAP2-MALT1 cleaved HOIL1 in the absence of CARD11. No cleavage resulted with catalytically inactive cIAP2-MALT1-Cys464Ala mutant or noncleavable HOIL1-Arg165Lys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), revealing that cIAP2-MALT1-mediated HOIL1 cleavage occurs without the need for CBM assembly.</p>

</sup> B and T cells</title>
        <p>The immunological relevance of HOIL1 cleavage by MALT1 was shown in several ways. First, we demonstrated that endogenous MALT1 of the CBM, together with HOIL1 of the LUBAC complex, co-localized at the cell membrane following B-cell receptor engagement by anti-IgG in immortalized B cells from a normal donor compared with the patient cells. After 2-h stimulation, HOIL1 was redistributed to the cell membrane, particularly at B-cell:B-cell contacts as discrete caps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
        <p>We next verified cleavage of endogenous HOIL1 by endogenous MALT1 after stimulation of B cells from a healthy donor and in the same <italic>MALT1</italic><sup>+/<italic>mut</italic></sup> and <italic>MALT1</italic><sup><italic>mut/mut</italic></sup> B-cell lysates analysed proteomically in multiple replicates (<italic>N</italic>=34; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Cleavage was markedly reduced in the <italic>MALT1</italic><sup><italic>mut/mut</italic></sup> B cells, with commensurate increases in both of the two molecular weight forms of intact HOIL1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Similarly, cleavage was reduced by the MALT1-selective inhibitor Z-Val-Arg-Pro-DL-Arg-fluoromethylketone (z-VRPR-fmk)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>) and by the small-molecule paracaspase inhibitor, mepazine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>).</p>
        <p>We observed HOIL1 cleavage in fresh PBMCs from a healthy donor and the heterozygous mother (<italic>N</italic>=9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>). In contrast, HOIL1 cleavage was undetectable in <italic>MALT1</italic><sup><italic>mut/mut</italic></sup> PBMCs. Skin biopsies from the patient revealed dense chronic lymphocytic infiltrates in the upper dermis surrounding vessels, with focal extension of the inflammatory infiltrates into the basal layer of the overlying epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Immunohistochemistry identified these as CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells prompting examination of MALT1 activity in T cells. HOIL1 was cleaved after PMA/ionomycin stimulation in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from a healthy donor and the <italic>MALT1</italic><sup>+/<italic>mut</italic></sup> brother, but not from the patient (<italic>N</italic>=6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref>). Thus, cleavage was not an effect of Epstein&#x2013;Barr virus immortalization and occurred with endogenous levels of protease and substrate in normal B and T cells.</p>

        <title>MALT1 cleavage of HOIL1 disassembles LUBAC</title>
        <p>LUBAC is a complex of HOIL1, HOIP and SHARPIN formed by interaction between the ubiquitin-like, ubiquitin-associated and Npl4 zinc-finger domains of the three LUBAC proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Neither HOIP nor SHARPIN was cleaved by MALT1 in the cellular context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Thus, HOIL1 is the only LUBAC subunit that is a MALT1 substrate.</p>
        <p>To mechanistically dissect the effect of MALT1 cleavage of HOIL1 on LUBAC assembly, we coexpressed V5-tagged HOIP and V5-tagged SHARPIN together with FLAG-tagged N-HOIL1 and FLAG-tagged C-HOIL1 cleavage-product analogues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Expressing N-HOIL1 with C-HOIL1 represents a non-physiological extreme of complete HOIL1 cleavage, but provides mechanistic insights into the role of HOIL1 in regulating LUBAC assembly and linear ubiquitination. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4c</xref> reveals that the N-terminal cleavage product of HOIL1 retains binding interactions with HOIP: V5-tagged HOIP was pulled down by anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation of FLAG-N-HOIL1 (lane 2) to a similar amount as found with full-length FLAG-HOIL1 (lane 1), but not by immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged C-HOIL1 (lane 3). N-HOIL1 alone associated with HOIP&#x2014;as did N-HOIL1 when expressed with C-HOIL1 as an analogue of HOIL1 cleavage (lane 4). Thus, C-HOIL1 neither binds nor modulates binding of N-HOIL1 to HOIP.</p>
        <p>We consistently found that HOIP levels were markedly reduced in the absence of HOIL1 (<italic>N=</italic>5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>, orange arrowheads)) compared with cells expressing full-length HOIL1 or N-HOIL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). This was not due to unequal transfection efficiency, but shows that N-HOIL1, like full-length HOIL1, stabilizes HOIP. Consistent with this model, HOIP was also reduced when C-HOIL1 alone was expressed with HOIP (<italic>N</italic>=6), suggesting that C-HOIL1 disengages from HOIP on cleavage and does not contribute to HOIP stabilization. However, due to the lower levels of HOIP in the absence of either HOIL1 or N-HOIL1, this is not an equivalent experimental set-up. Therefore, we transfected increasing amounts of HOIP. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref> using anti-V5 pulldowns for V5-tagged HOIP, no C-HOIL1 was detected by anti-FLAG immunoblotting, even when HOIP was expressed at equivalent levels using 5 &#xD7; the transfected amount of HOIP vector. Thus, C-HOIL1 disengages from LUBAC after MALT1 cleavage.</p>
        <p>As HOIP is not cleaved by MALT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>), we further explored the mechanism of HOIP destabilization in the absence of HOIL1. MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, revealed the presence of polyubiquitinated forms of HOIP when expressed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>, lane 1). In contrast, with full-length HOIL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>, lane 2), no high-molecular-weight conjugated forms were present. Thus, HOIL1 stabilizes HOIP and protects against proteasome-mediated turnover of HOIP, extending the previous analyses of the stabilizing influence of HOIL1 on HOIP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Indeed, in <italic>MALT1</italic><sup><italic>+/mut</italic></sup> B lymphocytes, endogenous HOIP levels showed a gradual and persistent decline up to 24&#x2009;h after PMA/ionomycin stimulation. This is consistent with the disassembly of LUBAC executed by MALT1 cleavage of HOIL1 with the gradual disengagement of HOIL1 cleavage fragments. In contrast, endogenous HOIP was unaltered over 24&#x2009;h in the <italic>MALT1</italic><sup><italic>mut/mut</italic></sup> B cells having reduced HOIL1 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Thus, LUBAC is under dynamic control by MALT1-mediated cleavage of HOIL1. After cleavage, C-HOIL1 releases from LUBAC, whereas N-HOIL1 can maintain its interaction with HOIP.</p>

        <title>HOIL1 cleavage decreases linear ubiquitination by LUBAC</title>
        <p>LUBAC polymerizes linear ubiquitin chains on immune protein targets. To directly assess the effects of HOIL1 cleavage on linear ubiquitination, we coexpressed HOIP and SHARPIN with either HOIL1 or the N-HOIL1 and C-HOIL1 cleavage analogues in the absence of MALT1. Immunoblotting for linear ubiquitin chains revealed that coexpression of all three intact LUBAC subunits was necessary to efficiently generate high-molecular-weight linear ubiquitin conjugates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>, lane 2), which were virtually abolished by the combination of N-HOIL1 and C-HOIL1 as an analogue of fully cleaved HOIL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The small amount of linear ubiquitin conjugates is consistent with the less efficient function of LUBAC observed when HOIP is expressed with SHARPIN alone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The NZF domain in the C terminus of HOIL1 binds linear polyubiquitin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and therefore positions the nascent linear ubiquitin chains proximal to the HOIP E3 ligase. With cleavage the NZF domain in C-HOIL1 is detached from LUBAC reducing LUBAC efficiency. Notably, Lys48-polyubiquitination of proteins was unaffected by the stable HOIL1 cleavage fragments, emphasizing the selectivity in downregulation of linear ubiquitination only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>).</p>
        <p>To study the end point of HOIL1 cleavage-induced changes in linear ubiquitination on NF-&#x3BA;B signalling, we quantified NF-&#x3BA;B signalling in the presence and absence of linear ubiquitination using a NF-&#x3BA;B promoter luciferase reporter assay. We found that intact LUBAC with the associated linear ubiquitination of cellular proteins stimulated NF-&#x3BA;B transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). In contrast, when N-HOIL1 and C-HOIL1 were equally coexpressed as the analogue of fully cleaved HOIL1, along with HOIP and SHARPIN, NF-&#x3BA;B promoter activation was lost, coincident with the reduction in linear ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Thus, intact HOIL1 is required for efficient LUBAC-dependent linear ubiquitination that is needed for NF-&#x3BA;B promoter activation. Upon HOIL1 cleavage LUBAC is disassembled. This leads to a cessation of linear ubiquitination that results in downregulation of NF-&#x3BA;B activation.</p>
        <p>We next expressed both LUBAC and active CBM to determine the effect of MALT1-mediated cleavage of HOIL1 on LUBAC. Consistent with our previous transfection results, we found that when both the CBM and LUBAC were present, total linear ubiquitination was markedly reduced by HOIL1 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>, lanes 3 and 5). In contrast, LUBAC activity was maintained when cells were transfected with catalytically inactive MALT1-Cys464Ala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>, lanes 4 and 7). Similarly, when the cells were transfected with noncleavable HOIL1-Arg165Lys, linear ubiquitin levels were maintained in the presence or absence of active CBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>, lanes 8 and 9). Thus, although HOIP is the linear ubiquitination E3 ligase, we found that the CBM reduces HOIP/HOIL1-dependent linear ubiquitination and NF-&#x3BA;B promoter activation that is executed by MALT1 cleavage of HOIL1.</p>

        <title>MALT1 activity reduces linear ubiquitination in B cells</title>
        <p>To translate these results to lymphocytes, we investigated the impact of HOIL1 cleavage by MALT1 on LUBAC function in B cells. We used agarose beads coupled with tandem ubiquitin binding entities (TUBEs) to enrich for the entire pool of ubiquitinated proteins. Immunoblotting for linear ubiquitin chains in the TUBE-enriched fraction revealed multiple linear ubiquitinated proteins before stimulation in both <italic>MALT1</italic><sup>+/<italic>mut</italic></sup> and <italic>MALT1</italic><sup><italic>mut/mut</italic></sup> B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>, 0&#x2009;h). Between 30 and 120&#x2009;min after PMA/ionomycin stimulation in <italic>MALT1</italic><sup><italic>+/mut</italic></sup> B lymphocytes, there was reduced linear ubiquitination of cellular proteins, which was associated with cleavage of endogenous HOIL1. In the <italic>MALT1</italic><sup><italic>mut/mut</italic></sup> B cells, both a less pronounced and a delayed reduction in total linear ubiquitination occurred concurrent with greatly reduced cleavage of HOIL1 (<italic>N</italic>=4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Importantly, MALT1 inhibition by z-VRPR-fmk reduced HOIL1 cleavage and strikingly maintained total linear ubiquitination levels for up to 4&#x2009;h in <italic>MALT1</italic><sup><italic>+/mut</italic></sup> B cells (<italic>N</italic>=6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>) and <italic>MALT1</italic><sup><italic>+/mut</italic></sup> and <italic>MALT1</italic><sup><italic>mut/mut</italic></sup> B cells (<italic>N</italic>=6; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). Protein levels of OTULIN, the linear polyubiquitin deubiquitinase, were unaltered on PMA/ionomycin stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>), reinforcing the direct linkage between MALT1 cleavage of HOIL1 and reduced linear ubiquitination.</p>
        <p>RIP1 is a substrate of LUBAC and showed a rapid (&lt;15&#x2009;min) loss in ubiquitinated forms after stimulation that was then followed by partial recovery in <italic>MALT1</italic><sup>+/<italic>mut</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). This pattern matched the markedly reduced levels of multiple linear ubiquitinated protein conjugates detected by immunoblotting with anti-linear ubiquitin antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Importantly, MALT1 inhibition abrogated both the general protein and the RIP-specific ubiquitination response to PMA/ionomycin stimulation demonstrating that MALT1 cleavage of HOIL1 reduces linear ubiquitination of both total proteins and the LUBAC target, RIP1.</p>
        <p>Intriguingly, the initial triggering of NF-&#x3BA;B signalling did not require MALT1 paracaspase activity, as shown by the similar initial reduction in I&#x3BA;B&#x3B1; and induction of p-p65 both with and without inhibitor in both <italic>MALT1</italic><sup>+/<italic>mut</italic></sup> and <italic>MALT1</italic><sup><italic>mut</italic>/<italic>mut</italic></sup> B cells (<italic>N=</italic>6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). This suggests that the scaffolding role of MALT1 is more important than its proteolytic activity for the initiation of NF-&#x3BA;B signalling. In contrast, cleavage of HOIL1 by MALT1 decreases linear ubiquitination of multiple proteins at later time points. Because RIP1 and NEMO promote NF-&#x3BA;B activation in a manner that depends on their linear ubiquitination, we posited that MALT1-dependent cleavage of HOIL1 may limit continued NF-&#x3BA;B activation. Following an initial 15-min stimulation with PMA/ionomycin, we re-stimulated again at 2&#x2009;h, a time point when linear ubiquitination was greatly diminished. We then followed cell responses until 4&#x2009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Notably, the p-p65 levels did not increase after the second stimulus indicative of no further NF-&#x3BA;B induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Although only correlative, these data are consistent with the relative balance in levels of intact and MALT1-cleaved HOIL1 modulating the degree of linear ubiquitination and hence degree of NF-&#x3BA;B activation. Notably, when no linear ubiquitinated protein was present, cells were rendered refractory to reactivation.</p>

        <title>Stimulation of primary lymphocytes reduces linear ubiquitin</title>
        <p>To confirm that the loss of linear ubiquitination after cleavage of HOIL1 is physiologically relevant, we analysed primary human lymphocytes. First, we obtained B-cell-rich cell homogenates from resected paediatric human tonsils. Cells were stimulated first with anti-IgG/IgM and CD40 ligand, and then with PMA/ionomycin. HOIL1 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>) was associated with a clear decrease in linear ubiquitination 20&#x2013;30&#x2009;min after PMA/ionomycin stimulation in multiple human samples (<italic>N=</italic>4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>). Moreover, the abundance of several distinct ubiquitinated forms of NEMO was also decreased coinciding with the loss of total linear ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>).</p>
        <p>Since obtaining sufficient numbers of blood-derived primary B cells for TUBE experiments from the patient was not ethically possible, we further validated the effect of HOIL1 cleavage on linear ubiquitination by returning to T cells, which skin biopsy had shown were dominant in the upper dermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>). On PMA/ionomycin stimulation of Jurkat T cells, HOIL1 levels were reduced; and the role of MALT1 cleavage was confirmed by the reduced generation of N-HOIL1 with the MALT1 inhibitors z-VRPR-fmk and Mepazine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>).</p>
        <p>To show that cleavage of HOIL1 by MALT1 in T cells is a downstream consequence of lymphocyte antigen receptor/co-stimulatory receptor engagement, we incubated primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from healthy donors (<italic>N</italic>=3) with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 functionalized beads. T-cell receptor/CD28 engagement stimulated HOIL1 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>), but to a lesser extent than the pharmacological PMA/ionomycin stimulation. Thus, HOIL1 cleavage is a consequence of B- and T-cell stimulation with PMA/ionomycin and of T-cell receptor engagement.</p>
        <p>Next, primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the heterozygous brother were stimulated with PMA/ionomycin. As with B cells, we observed a time-dependent decrease in linear ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>) and specifically of NEMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7f</xref>). In contrast, total Lys48-polyubiquitination remained constant on stimulation, confirming the specificity of the reduction to linear ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>). The loss of linear ubiquitin conjugates, and specifically of NEMO ubiquitination, was blocked by MALT1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7f</xref>), emphasizing that this effect in human T cells was dependent on MALT1 paracaspase activity and cleavage of HOIL1.</p>
        <p>To widen the physiological relevance of our findings, we showed that HOIL1 cleavage occurred 30&#x2009;min after PMA/ionomycin stimulation of primary murine lymph node CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, but not in knockout mouse cells lacking MALT1 or in cells from catalytic inactive MALT1-Cys/Ala knock-in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). Therefore, HOIL1 cleavage is not human specific, emphasizing the broader relevance of HOIL1 as a substrate. In wild-type murine CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, HOIL1 cleavage occurred 30&#x2009;min after stimulation. At this later time, and as shown by the cessation of the sudden increase in p-I&#x3BA;B&#x3B1; and p-p65, the initial NF-&#x3BA;B activation at 10&#x2009;min had ended. We next compared the scaffolding versus paracaspase activities of murine MALT1 in NF-&#x3BA;B activation in PMA/ionomycin-stimulated primary murine lymph node CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells. Ten minutes after PMA/ionomycin stimulation, both the wild-type and catalytic inactive MALT1-C/A knock-in murine T cells showed similar levels of induced p-p65 and p-I&#x3BA;B&#x3B1; that was coupled with reduced I&#x3BA;B&#x3B1;. In contrast, in the absence of MALT1 in <italic>Malt1</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice, NF-&#x3BA;B was not activated, whereas phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was indistinguishable and confirmed cellular activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). Thus, the murine <italic>Malt1</italic> knockout and knock-in studies in T cells confirm the human B-cell MALT1 inhibitor data showing that MALT1 paracaspase activity was dispensable for NF-&#x3BA;B activation.</p>

        <title>B-cell activation by antigen-presenting cells reduces LUBAC</title>
        <p><italic>In vivo</italic>, B cells are often activated by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that capture antigens to display on their surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. The binding of B-cell receptors to mobile membrane-bound antigens leads to forming B-cell receptor microclusters that nucleate signalosome formation and activate downstream signalling pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Because linear ubiquitin chains act as scaffolds to recruit and organize signalling proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>, we asked whether they accumulate at the B cell:APC contact site (that is, immune synapse), and specifically at B-cell receptor microclusters. Primary murine splenic B cells were added to Cos7 APCs that express on their surface a transmembrane form of an anti-Ig&#x3BA; light-chain antibody (that is, surrogate antigen) that binds to all B-cell receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. B cells do not attach to Cos7 cells not expressing this surrogate antigen. At 10&#x2009;min after adding B cells to anti-Ig&#x3BA;-expressing Cos7 APCs, puncta of linear ubiquitin staining were observed at the B cell:APC contact site by spinning disc confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>). The punctate linear ubiquitin staining also co-localized with B-cell receptor microclusters, which were visualized as puncta of the surrogate antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c</xref>). Although the linear ubiquitin puncta co-localized with B-cell receptor microclusters, only a subset of B-cell receptor microclusters was associated with linear ubiquitin. <italic>z</italic>-Sections through the centre of the B cell showed that linear ubiquitin conjugates were found primarily at the B cell:APC contact site, often at sites where antigens were concentrated at B-cell receptor microclusters.</p>
        <p>Time courses showed that the accumulation of linear ubiquitin-conjugated proteins at the B cell:APC contact site was significantly lower (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) at 15 and 30&#x2009;min after adding the B cells to the APCs than at the 10-min time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8d</xref>). Thus, the time course for the decrease in linear ubiquitination in primary murine B cells stimulated through the B-cell receptor matched those for primary human B and T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig.7</xref>). Notably, we found that MALT1 paracaspase activity was important for the time-dependent decrease in linear ubiquitination-modified proteins. Pretreating the B cells with the z-VRPR-fmk inhibitor significantly delayed the loss of total linear ubiquitination at the B cell:APC contact site at the 15 and 30&#x2009;min time points (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8d</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our discovery of a new MALT1 substrate, which was enabled by a unique patient with genetic MALT1 deficiency, has defined a new biological role for MALT1. We report a previously unrecognized yet direct proteolytic connection between the CBM signalosome and LUBAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8e</xref>). By transiently reducing linear ubiquitination at the lymphocyte antigen receptor microcluster, MALT1 displays temporally separated actions in NF-&#x3BA;B signalling&#x2014;initially as a feedforward inducer and then ultimately as a negative-feedback inhibitor. To date, MALT1 proteolytic activity has only been proposed to indirectly increase NF-&#x3BA;B activation by cleavage and removal of negative regulators of the canonical NF-&#x3BA;B pathway. However, we show that MALT1 also results in a single specific cleavage in HOIL1, disrupting LUBAC by release of C-HOIL1, to downregulate linear ubiquitination at the B-cell receptor microcluster signalosome. The NZF domain in C-HOIL1 binds LUBAC to linear ubiquitin chains and so is key for LUBAC E3 ligase efficiency. Therefore, HOIL1 cleavage impairs linear polyubiquitin formation and is associated with reduced LUBAC-mediated NF-&#x3BA;B activation. Loss of MALT1 proteolytic activity in the patient lymphocytes and, with failure to cleave HOIL1, led to an increase in linear ubiquitination levels. This eventually rendered the patient with unrestricted B-cell activation leading to chronic inflammatory responses.</p>
      <p>We also observed that triggering of NF-&#x3BA;B signalling did not require MALT1 paracaspase activity. A similar initial reduction in I&#x3BA;B&#x3B1; and induction of p-p65 occurred both with and without a MALT1 inhibitor in activation of human B cells and of murine T cells from wild-type and MALT1-Cys/Ala protease-inactive knock-in mice. This adds a new layer to our understanding of the molecular links in CBM complex and LUBAC crosstalk with NF-&#x3BA;B signalling. Moreover, our results showing first positive and then negative regulation of NF-&#x3BA;B activation by MALT1 indicate that therapeutic intervention with MALT1 inhibitors for autoimmunity or lymphoid neoplasia needs to be considered carefully.</p>
      <p>The HOIL1 cleavage site is proximal to Gln185, one of two germline mutation sites in <italic>HOIL1</italic>-<italic>mutant</italic> immunodeficient patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> that have clinical overlap with features of the <italic>MALT1</italic><sup><italic>mut/mut</italic></sup> patient<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Although Nakamura <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref> reported HOIL1 cleavage, they did not identify the responsible protease or the physiological consequences. In primary B and T lymphocytes, we found reductions in both total protein linear ubiquitination and levels of the specific target proteins, NEMO and RIP1, on HOIL1 cleavage. This loss of proteins modified by linear ubiquitin was blocked by inhibition of MALT1; thereby directly linking reduced linear ubiquitination with MALT1 paracaspase activity. In view of the indirect amplification of NF-&#x3BA;B by the previously described MALT1-cleavage substrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, it was surprising that MALT1 inhibition did not alter p-p65 and I&#x3BA;B&#x3B1; levels on initiation of the NF-&#x3BA;B pathway. This is in agreement with very recent reports also showing the key role of MALT1 scaffolding in NF-&#x3BA;B induction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Indeed, initiation of NF-&#x3BA;B signalling in <italic>MALT1</italic><sup><italic>mut/mut</italic></sup> B cells was dampened compared with healthy <italic>MALT1</italic><sup>+/<italic>mut</italic></sup> family members due to disruption of MALT1 scaffolding caused by low levels of unstable mutant MALT1-Trp580Ser protein.</p>
      <p>The possible involvement of LUBAC-mediated linear ubiquitination in B-cell receptor signalling was only recently postulated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. As direct induction of linear ubiquitination has not been previously observed in B-cell receptor signalling and in view of the rearrangement of linear ubiquitin scaffolds to the cell membrane-anchored receptor signalosome that we observed, we posit that ubiquitin scaffolds are essential both proximal and distal to the CBM complex at early time points after B-cell receptor engagement. Indeed, we showed co-localization of CBM and LUBAC at the cell membrane followed by loss of linear ubiquitinated proteins after B-cell receptor engagement. Hence, the cleavage of HOIL1 by MALT1 with the subsequent removal from the signalosome may be another, yet quite different switch by which B cells regulate NF-&#x3BA;B signalling after B-cell receptor activation. This negative-feedback mechanism may serve to avoid undesired processes associated with unrestricted B-cell activation such as in autoimmunity. Indeed, the reduced ability of the <italic>MALT1</italic><sup><italic>mut/mut</italic></sup> patient to cleave HOIL1 and disassemble LUBAC may explain her excessive chronic inflammatory responses that are a challenging clinical aspect of human MALT1 deficiency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Through this enhanced understanding of critical interactions between MALT1 and LUBAC, we now have a mechanistic explanation for the patient's seemingly contradictory clinical phenotype&#x2014;which encompassed both susceptibility to infection and exaggerated inflammation due to persistent canonical NF-&#x3BA;B signalling. Whereas the failure to activate NF-&#x3BA;B quickly and appropriately during microbial challenge resulted in increased susceptibility to infections, the reduced ability to cleave HOIL1 and reduce linear ubiquitination is consistent with unrelenting NF-&#x3BA;B signalling leading to a destructive chronic inflammation of her skin and gastrointestinal tract that was only partially controllable with systemic corticosteroid therapy.</p>
      <p>The diagnosis and molecular characterization of rare human primary immunodeficiency diseases plays a critical role in expanding our understanding of the human immune system and in the development of new treatments that have applications beyond immunodeficiency diseases. We used TAILS to directly study the complex consequences of a genetic MALT1 deficiency in humans. This contrasts the usual situation where inferences are drawn by necessity from animal models. HOIL1 is a component of the LUBAC complex, which catalyses linear ubiquitination of several important components and regulators of the canonical NF-&#x3BA;B machinery, including RIP1 and NEMO. By identifying HOIL1 as a novel MALT1 substrate, we bring functional insight to CBM/LUBAC crosstalk. From accumulating data and our present results, we suggest that MALT1 has three temporally separated roles in canonical NF-&#x3BA;B signalling&#x2014;for the initial triggering of NF-&#x3BA;B, MALT1 protease activity is not required for IKK activation and NF-&#x3BA;B signalling. Rather, MALT1 scaffolding links the CBM signalosome to the B-cell receptor microcluster, which we show is co-localized with linear ubiquitin complexes. In the next time step, MALT1-dependent direct cleavage removes negative regulators such as RelB, CYLD and A20, and thereby optimizing NF-&#x3BA;B activation and cellular responses. At later stages, MALT1 proteolysis invokes an overall negative-feedback mechanism by decreasing LUBAC function, thereby reducing linear ubiquitination that contributes to rendering lymphocytes refractory to undesired ongoing and secondary NF-&#x3BA;B activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8e</xref>). Thereby, MALT1 is a pleiotropic controller of canonical NF-&#x3BA;B activation.</p>

        <p>For cell lysis, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed in 1 &#xD7; PBS and the cell pellets lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer (50&#x2009;mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150&#x2009;mM NaCl, 1.0% NP-40) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail and phosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche Life Science) and clarified by centrifugation. To preserve ubiquitin chains the cells were lysed by directly adding 1 &#xD7; SDS reducing sample buffer to the washed cell pellets. After boiling, nuclear DNA was sheared by ultrasonication and proteins were separated on 4&#x2013;12% Bis-Tris SDS&#x2013;PAGE gradient gels (Life Technologies). Proteins were detected by immunoblotting using the following antibodies: anti-CYLD (E-10) and anti-BCL10 (H-197) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-MALT1 (MCA2801, clone 50) and anti-V5 (SV5-Pk1) from Serotec/AbD; anti-&#x3B2;-tubulin (AA2), anti-linear ubiquitin (MABS199), anti-K48-linked ubiquitin (Apu2) and anti-V5 (AB9732) from Merck-Millipore; anti-&#x3B2;-tubulin (tub2.1), anti-HOIL1 (HPA024185) and anti-Flag (M2) from Sigma-Aldrich; anti-RelB (C1E4), anti-CYLD (D1A10) and anti-CARD11 (1D12) from Cell Signaling Technology; anti-turboGFP (2H8) was from Origene; anti-HOIP (ab46322) from Abcam; and anti-linear ubiquitin (Lub9) from BioSensors.

After 24&#x2009;h, transfected Cos7 APCs were detached using enzyme free dissociation buffer (0.5&#x2009;mM EDTA, 100&#x2009;mM, NaCl, 1&#x2009;mM glucose, pH 7.4) and 1.5 &#xD7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells were plated on 18-mm glass coverslips that had been coated with 5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> fibronectin. The APCs were cultured for 12&#x2009;h in DMEM plus 10% FBS supplemented with 1% <sc>L</sc>-glutamine, 1% Na pyruvate and 0.05% penicillin/streptomycin to allow cells to spread and flatten.</p>
        <p>Murine splenic B cells were isolated from C57BL/6J mice (9-week 4-day male, and 19-week 4-day male) (animal protocols were approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee) using a B-cell isolation kit (Stemcell Technologies) to deplete non-B cells. B cells (2 &#xD7; 10<sup>6</sup>) were resuspended in 0.4&#x2009;ml modified HEPES-buffered saline (25&#x2009;mM sodium HEPES, pH 7.2, 125&#x2009;mM NaCl, 5&#x2009;mM KCl, 1&#x2009;mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1&#x2009;mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5&#x2009;mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1&#x2009;mg&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> glucose, 2&#x2009;mM glutamine, 1&#x2009;mM sodium pyruvate, 50&#x2009;&#x3BC;M 2-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 2% FBS and then incubated with 75&#x2009;&#x3BC;M z-VRPR-fmk or an equivalent volume of H<sub>2</sub>O for 30&#x2009;min at 37&#x2009;&#xB0;C. The B cells (1 &#xD7; 10<sup>6</sup> per coverslip) were then added to the Cos7 APCs and allowed to attach for 10&#x2013;30&#x2009;min at 37&#x2009;&#xB0;C before fixing the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde.</p>
        <p>Before staining, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and then blocked with 2% BSA, 10% goat serum and 25&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> of the 2.4G2 monoclonal antibody, which blocks Fc receptors on the B cells. The cells were then stained with AlexaFluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (H+L chain-reactive; Life Technologies, catalogue number A11077) to visualize the anti-Ig&#x3BA; surrogate Ag, and with a mouse IgG1 anti-linear polyubiquitin (LUB9) monoclonal antibody (LifeSensors, catalogue # AB130, the same antibody used to probe the TUBEs assays)), the same antibody was used to probe the TUBE assay blots, followed by staining with an AlexaFluor 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 (&#x3B3;1 H chain-specific; Life Technologies, catalogue number A21240) secondary antibody and AlexaFluor 488 Phalloidin (Life Technologies catalogue # A12379) to visualize F-actin. Naive primary B cells, which express IgM and IgD, but not IgG, were not stained to any significant extent by the goat anti-mouse IgG1 secondary antibody in the absence of primary antibody.

        <p>Cells were imaged using spinning disk confocal microscope system (3i&#x2014;Intelligent Imaging Innovations) with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope with a &#xD7; 100 numerical aperture 1.45 oil Pan-Fluor objective and QuantEM 512SC Photometrics camera. All images were acquired using identical settings and analysed using FIJI and MATLAB software. Optical <italic>z</italic>-slices were imaged through the cell at 0.2-&#x3BC;m intervals. To produce the side view in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>. FIJI software was used to reslice the <italic>z</italic>-stacks at 0.2-&#x3BC;m intervals. A centre slice was picked for images. MATLAB software was used to analyse images for fluorescence intensity. Fluorescence signals for linear ubiquitin and antigen (single-chain anti-Ig&#x3BA;) were measured at the contact site between the B cell and the Cos7 APCs. For cells where the contact site between B cell and the APC was not in one focal plane could not be analysed and were excluded.</p>
        <p>To compute fluorescence intensities, each image was first filtered using Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filters at a range of scales (scale=square of Gaussian s.d.). Specifically, the Gaussian s.d.'s used were every value in the range from 0.08 to 0.48&#x2009;&#x3BC;m at intervals of 0.04&#x2009;&#x3BC;m. To threshold the image for noise, the median absolute deviation of pixel values was computed and used to estimate (multiplying by 1.4826) the s.d. For each filtered image, the threshold was set at six noise s.d.'s above the mean pixel intensity. Finally, a mask generated by retaining all pixels present at any scale after thresholding LoG filtered images was applied to the original image and all pixel values within the mask were summed to yield the total fluorescence intensity. This value was normalized to the total surrogate antigen fluorescence intensity for the same cell.</p>

A substrate was identified only if the neo-N-terminal peptide was internal, that is, not starting at a recognized protein start or processing site, and was N-terminally blocked by a TMT label. Moreover, the neo-N-terminal peptides must be significantly more abundant in samples from the heterozygous controls compared with the MALT1-deficient patient and with the peptide-spectrum match (PSM) ratio higher than the 75th percentile+1.5 &#xD7; interquartile range; the neo-N-terminal peptide must have increased abundance in PMA/ionomycin-stimulated samples compared with the vehicle control for the same subject; where the protein natural N terminus was also identified the neo-N-terminal peptide to natural N-terminal peptide ratio was high to ensure that cleavage was not merely increased concomitantly with increased total protein after stimulation of between cells; the neo-N-termini were reproducibly identified in two or more TAILS samples and by &#x2265;3 spectra; finally, the cleavage site needed to conform to the strict MALT1-cleavage site specificity of an arginine at P1 and was cleaved in biochemical <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage assays.</p>

        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Immunoblotting for total linear ubiquitination and HOIL1 cleavage in the TUBE-enriched fraction from &#x3B1;-IgG/M-CD40L primed tonsil B-cell homogenates from a normal (+/+N) subject on PMA/ionomycin stimulation. * Represents nonspecific band. &#x3B2;-Actin, loading control. (<bold>b</bold>) TUBE pulldown and subsequent immunoblotting for linear ubiquitin conjugates and the known LUBAC target NEMO in tonsil B-cell homogenates from normal (+/+N) subjects on stimulation with PMA/ionomycin. Cells were primed with &#x3B1;-IgG/M and CD40L. NEMO-polyubiquitin conjugates were calculated as marked. <italic>N</italic>=7 for <bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold>. (<bold>c</bold>) &#x3B1;-N-HOIL1 immunoblot for PMA/ionomycin-induced cleavage of HOIL1 in Jurkat T cells with and without MALT1 inhibitors z-VRPR-fmk (20&#x2009;&#x3BC;M) and Mepazine (20&#x2009;&#x3BC;M). * Represents nonspecific bands. (<bold>d</bold>) &#x3B1;-HOIL1 immunoblot for HOIL1 cleavage on stimulation of expanded primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the brother (+/<italic>mut</italic> B) with PMA/ionomycin and with &#x3B1;-CD3/&#x3B1;-CD28 coated beads (<italic>N</italic>=3). The polyclonal antibody detects both the C-terminal and the N-terminal cleavage products. * Represents consistently observed nonspecific band. &#x3B2;-Actin, loading control. (<bold>e</bold>) Immunoblots for total linear ubiquitination after TUBE pulldown in expanded primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the brother (+/<italic>mut</italic> B) on stimulation with PMA/ionomycin. K48-linked ubiquitination was included for reference. &#x3B2;-Actin, loading control. (<bold>f</bold>) Immunoblots for total linear ubiquitin conjugates and NEMO in PMA/ionomycin-stimulated expanded primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the brother (+/<italic>mut</italic> B), with and without pretreatment with MALT1 inhibitor z-VRPR-fmk (<italic>N</italic>=3).

        <title>MALT1 cleavage of HOIL1 decreases linear ubiquitination in mouse lymphocytes.</title>
        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Immunoblots for N-HOIL1, p-ERK1/2 and NF-&#x3BA;B signalling proteins (p-I&#x3BA;B&#x3B1;, I&#x3BA;B&#x3B1; and p-p65) in stimulated murine primary lymph node CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells derived from wild-type mice, the littermate <italic>Malt1</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> and the <italic>Malt1-C/A</italic> catalytic inactive mutant knock-in to <italic>Malt1</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>, <italic>N</italic>=2. Tubulin, loading control. * Represents nonspecific band as observed in Jurkat T cells; ** Represents residual signal from p-ERK1/2 blot; *** Represents nonspecific bands and residual p-ERK1/2 signal. (<bold>b</bold>) Murine splenic B cells treated with vehicle (control) or 75&#x2009;&#x3BC;M MALT1 inhibitor (z-VRPR-fmk) for 30&#x2009;min were exposed to APCs for the indicated times. <italic>z</italic>-Slices through the centre of B cells stained for F-actin (red) and linear polyubiquitin (M1-Ub, green) are shown. Scale bar, 5&#x2009;&#x3BC;m. (<bold>c</bold>) Representative spinning disk confocal <italic>xy</italic> slices at the contact site of three individual primary murine splenic B cells that were added to APCs for 10&#x2009;min before staining for the anti-Ig&#x3BA; surrogate antigen (red) and M1-linear polyubiquitin (green). White lines show the B-cell periphery at the contact site, as visualized by F-actin staining. Yellow arrowheads show sites of linear ubiquitin and antigen microcluster co-localization. Scale bar, 5&#x2009;&#x3BC;m. (<bold>d</bold>) Normalized linear ubiquitin fluorescence intensity in the <italic>xy</italic> plane at the B cell:APC contact site was quantified from images similar to those in <bold>c</bold> and normalized for the amount of antigen staining at each contact surface. Each dot represents a single B cell. Blue line depicts the median value of <italic>n</italic>=91&#x2013;120 B cells from two independent experiments (<italic>N</italic>=2). Box shows interquartile range. ****<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001 using the Mann&#x2013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. (<bold>e</bold>) Scheme depicting normal initiation of NF-&#x3BA;B signalling by B-cell receptor (BCR) microclusters (green arrows) via MALT1 scaffolding in the CBM and the canonical I&#x3BA;B kinase (IKK) complex, consisting of NEMO/IKK&#x3B3; with IKK&#x3B1; and IKK&#x3B2; subunits. In the signal amplification stage, MALT1 cleavage removes negative regulators and thereby optimizes NF-&#x3BA;B activation. The late-stage negative-feedback loop is executed by MALT1 paracaspase activity cleaving HOIL1 in LUBAC (red arrows) to transiently reduce linear ubiquitination of targets including NEMO/IKK&#x3B3;, hence reducing NF-&#x3BA;B signalling at late time points and is associated with preventing further ongoing NF-&#x3BA;B stimulation.</p>
