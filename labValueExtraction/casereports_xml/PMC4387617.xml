    <p><bold>Clinical data:</bold> Shortness of breath on mild to moderate exertion for 2 months
accompanied by heart palpitations. The patient did not report any previous heart disease,
had never received specific medication throughout life and did not report cyanosis. He was
started on furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and losartan, with
improvement of symptoms. Laboratory tests showed H= 6,800,000/mm<sup>3</sup>; Hct = 63%; Hg
= 20.6 g/dL; BUN&#xA0;=&#xA0;103; creatinine = 2.03; BNP = 286.</p>
    <p><bold>Physical examination:</bold> normal breathing ; with grade 1/4 cyanosis; arrhythmic
pulses, grade 2/4 jugular venous distension. Weight 65 kg, height 170 cm, blood pressure
(BP) 100/60 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 82 bpm, oxygen saturation 88%. Grade 1/4 aorta (Ao)
palpable on the suprasternal notch.</p>
    <p>In the precordium, apical impulse diffusely palpable on the fourth and fifth left
intercostal space and slight systolic impulses on the left sternal border. Diminished heart
sounds; grade 1/6 coarse systolic murmur on the left sternal border and apex. Liver not
palpable.</p>

      <p><bold>Chest radiograph</bold> showed moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette
(cardiothoracic ratio: 0.61), resulting from enlarged right chambers. The pulmonary
vascular network was slightly decreased, the arch of the pulmonary artery was concave,
and the aortic knob was prominent. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
      <p><bold>Echocardiogram</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>) showed a
thickened dysplastic tricuspid valve with a 19-mm fusion of the septal cusp and
defective central coaptation, as well as marked tricuspid regurgitation. The right
chambers were much dilated (right ventricle (RV) = 47 mm; left ventricle (LV) = 38 mm;
left atrium (LA) = 41 mm; (right atrium (RA)&#xA0;=&#xA0;36&#xA0;mm), with the area of the right atrium
added to that of the atrialized RV (with 56.5 cm<sup>2</sup>), of the functional RV
(with 17.6&#xA0;cm<sup>2</sup>), of the LA (with 13.9 cm<sup>2</sup>) and LV (with 15.6
cm<sup>2</sup>). The Celemajer index was calculated at 1.2. The inferior vena cava
was dilated, with 23&#xA0;mm, with spontaneous contrast enhancement. The tricuspid ring had
57 mm, the mitral ring 35 mm, the pulmonary ring 20 mm, and the aortic ring 24 mm. The
LV ejection fraction was 66%, and the pulmonary arteries had 14 mm. There was a foramen
ovale with bidirectional shunt and the atrial septum bulged to the left. RV systolic
pressure was 30 mmHg.</p>

      <p><bold>Clinical diagnosis:</bold> Ebstein anomaly with marked tricuspid valve dysplasia
and severe tricuspid regurgitation, with mild chronic hypoxemia in natural course.</p>
      <p><bold>Clinical reasoning:</bold> The clinical elements of cyanotic heart disease with
long-standing low pulmonary flow and hypoxemia are expressed by shortness of breath and
increased hematocrit. The diminished heart sounds suggest normal arterial position and
low pulmonary flow resulting from severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild systolic
murmur due to contiguous low-pressure chambers. The right atrium, the atrialized RV and
functional RV behave as a true single chamber. RV diastolic overload on the
electrocardiogram (ECG) suggests the diagnosis of tricuspid regurgitation. Chest
radiograph shows markedly increased right chambers with slightly decreased pulmonary
vascular network. Taken together, these elements point to the diagnosis of Ebstein
anomaly.</p>
      <p><bold>Differential diagnosis:</bold> Heart diseases with hypoxemia and dilatation of
right chambers are also found in their natural course in long-standing pulmonary
stenosis, however with RV systolic overload. Other heart diseases uncommonly manifest as
seen in this case.</p>
      <p><bold>Management:</bold> In face of the long-standing hypoxemic consequences, with
unfavorable clinical manifestations, cardiac surgery was considered for tricuspid valve
replacement despite the higher risk due to the advanced patient age. For this purpose,
other studies of RV viability are necessary to more adequately determine the RV function
and, in turn, to support the best treatment option. As a precautionary measure, medical
treatment was chosen aiming at treating the cardiac arrhythmia and heart failure, mainly
considering the advanced patient age.</p>
      <p><bold>Commentaries:</bold> Few similar cases of Ebstein anomaly are found in their
natural course at advanced ages <sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. It is known that only 5% of these
patients survive naturally beyond their 5th decade of life. It is a fact that, even with
severe tricuspid regurgitation, cases that extrapolate the cardiac compensation
phenomena for such a long time are sometimes identified. It can be stated that this
anomaly is well tolerated provided the RV function is preserved, as seems to have been
the case in this patient. However, in the presence of RV dysfunction, the course of the
disease is shorter, due to the higher volume overload. Supraventricular cardiac
arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation, adds more risk to this course, given the
greater possibility of thrombi formation and embolism. Even aware of the potentially
unfavorable course, it is difficult to indicate surgery because of acquired conditions
such as myocardial fibrosis and hypoxemic changes in other organs such as the kidneys
and liver, which undoubtedly pose greater risks to elderly patients. Hence, the logical
advice for an expectant medical management.</p>
