      <abstract>
        <p>Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins are ubiquitously expressed in the human body and are important for various functions at the cell surface. Mutations in many GPI biosynthesis genes have been described to date in patients with multi-system disease and together these constitute a subtype of congenital disorders of glycosylation. We used whole exome sequencing in two families to investigate the genetic basis of disease and used RNA and cellular studies to investigate the functional consequences of sequence variants in the <italic>PIGY</italic> gene. Two families with different phenotypes had homozygous recessive sequence variants in the GPI biosynthesis gene <italic>PIGY</italic>. Two sisters with c.137T&gt;C (p.Leu46Pro) <italic>PIGY</italic> variants had multi-system disease including dysmorphism, seizures, severe developmental delay, cataracts and early death. There were significantly reduced levels of GPI-anchored proteins (CD55 and CD59) on the surface of patient-derived skin fibroblasts (&#x223C;20&#x2013;50% compared with controls). In a second, consanguineous family, two siblings had moderate development delay and microcephaly. A homozygous <italic>PIGY</italic> promoter variant (c.-540G&gt;A) was detected within a 7.7 Mb region of autozygosity. This variant was predicted to disrupt a SP1 consensus binding site and was shown to be associated with reduced gene expression. Mutations in <italic>PIGY</italic> can occur in coding and non-coding regions of the gene and cause variable phenotypes. This article contributes to understanding of the range of disease phenotypes and disease genes associated with deficiencies of the GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway and also serves to highlight the potential importance of analysing variants detected in 5&#x2032;-UTR regions despite their typically low coverage in exome data.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) acts as a membrane anchor for many cell-surface proteins including receptors, enzymes and adhesion molecules. At least 25 genes are involved in the step-wise production of mature GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) (<xref rid="DDV331C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). GPI biosynthesis is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum from phosphatidylinositol (PI) in a reaction mediated by the GPI-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex. The GPI-GnT enzyme complex consists of seven proteins including PIG-A, PIG-C, PIG-H, PIG-P, PIG-Q, DPM2 and PIG-Y. Phosphatidylinositol glycan class Y (PIG-Y), the smallest subunit of this complex, is a 71-amino acid protein containing two putative transmembrane domains and it directly associates with the catalytic subunit PIG-A.

In Family A, we identified a homozygous c.137T&gt;C variant in two affected sisters presenting with a multi-system disease encompassing dysmorphism, developmental delay, seizures, cataracts and gastrointestinal dysmotility. Levels of two GPI-APs on patient fibroblasts were reduced, providing evidence that these sequence variants impair GPI synthesis and are pathogenic. In Family B, we identified a c.-540G&gt;A mutation in the promoter region in a consensus SP1 site. The affected siblings from Family B have primary microcephaly, moderate developmental delay and are more mildly affected in comparison to Family A.

WT-PIG-Y transfection restored the cell surface expression of both CD55 and CD59, but the p.Leu46Pro mutant PIG-Y did not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV331F3">3</xref>A). Levels of their expression by the mutant PIGY were similar to the empty vector control. To test if the lack of activity is due to the instability of the mutant PIG-Y protein, stronger (<xref rid="DDV331C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) expression was needed for detection by western blotting. For this, Daudi cells were transiently transfected with WT or mutant (p.Leu46Pro) pME-oriP HA-PIGY vectors. With this strong promoter-driven vector, the mutant <italic>PIGY</italic> restored the surface expression of CD59 similarly to WT <italic>PIGY</italic>, indicating that the mutant PIG-Y likely has some GPI biosynthetic activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV331F3">3</xref>B). As demonstrated by western blotting, the mutant protein expression was significantly decreased compared with when WT-PIGY was transfected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV331F3">3</xref>B). These data suggest that the p.Leu46Pro mutation reduces PIG-Y protein stability leading to lower protein levels and a reduced capacity to synthesize GPI anchors for correct protein targeting to the cell surface.

As the mutation in the SP1 consensus sequence (located at chr4:89,444,948, hg19) is 4 bp from the transcription start site, this position could not be interrogated directly in cDNA. Instead, the rs3177413 C/T polymorphism was used as a surrogate for the SP1 mutation&#x2014;familial transmission confirmed that the SP1 mutation is <italic>in cis</italic> with the T allele at rs3177413. Based on raw read counts from two independent cDNA templates, the C/T allelic ratio at rs3177413 (located at chr4: 89 443 162) showed that in heterozygote carriers, only 7&#x2013;11% of RNA was expressed from the mutant allele (in bold). In contrast, a control subject who was heterozygous for rs3177413 but who did not have the SP1 mutation showed biallelic expression (44&#x2013;51% from T allele). Sequencing of all samples was performed on a single 314 chip using the Ion Torrent PGM using the Ion Torrent variant caller software after deconvolution of individual sample barcodes. Ion Torrent bidirectional sequencing allows the data derived from the coding and non-coding strands to be analysed independently, and these were shown to be in good agreement with one another. Analysis of genomic DNA from heterozygous samples at rs2177413 were added as internal controls to confirm that there was no amplification or sequencing bias towards one allele, while rs3177413 homozygote samples confirmed that sequencing noise at this position was minimal (&lt;0.2%).

Two affected sisters from Family A, who were homozygous for a missense mutation in <italic>PIGY</italic> (p.Leu46Pro), died from severe multi-system disease while two affected siblings from Family B, homozygous for a mutation in the promoter region of <italic>PIGY</italic> (c.-540G&gt;A), presented with moderate developmental delay and microcephaly. The p.Leu46Pro substitution involves a conserved residue in the second putative transmembrane domain (<xref rid="DDV331C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Amino acids in this domain and the carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic region are relatively more conserved among species and may be important for interaction with PIG-A, a catalytic component of GPI-GnT. The substitution of leucine to proline, which is less hydrophobic and is inhibitory to the formation of &#x3B1;-helices, might affect association with PIG-A, thereby causing instability of mutant PIG-Y protein as suggested by our results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV331F3">3</xref>B). Fibroblasts derived from both affected sisters from Family A show a 20&#x2013;50% reduction in protein expression of CD55 and CD59 at the cell surface by flow cytometric assessment, consistent with a defect in GPI-anchor biosynthesis in these patients. Using a cell culture model, we show that expression of mutant p.Leu46Pro PIG-Y in the PIG-Y deficient Daudi cell line only partially restores the cell surface expression of the GPI protein markers CD55 and CD59. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that the p.Leu46Pro substitution leads to defects in GPI-APs in patient cells.</p><p>Family A had multi-system disease consistent with previously described disorders of GPI anchor biosynthesis, whilst Family B had less severe disease limited to microcephaly and global developmental delay. This is likely due to differences in the mutations between the two families and their effects on PIG-Y protein function. We have shown that the promoter mutation in Family B markedly reduces <italic>PIGY</italic> transcript levels in blood, which likely leads to reduced expression of functionally normal PIG-Y protein. We hypothesize that the level of PIG-Y expression in most tissues in Family B is sufficient for many aspects of health, explaining why Family B's phenotype is more limited. The effects of the SP1-binding site mutation on <italic>PIGY</italic> transcript levels may also vary between tissues. Indeed, initial experiments showed no difference in levels of CD16, a GPI-AP, in granulocytes from affected individuals from Family B, suggesting that PIG-Y levels are sufficient for normal GPI biosynthesis in that tissue. The only known cases of GPI deficiency caused by promoter mutations are PIGM deficiency (<xref rid="DDV331C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Two individuals with the same homozygous promoter mutation had hepatic vein thrombosis, which has never been reported in GPI deficiency caused by mutations in protein coding regions. It is therefore not surprising that affected individuals from Family B who had homozygous promoter mutation had phenotypes quite different from those of affected individuals from Family A who had mutations in coding region. In contrast, the mutation in Family A will lead to expression of the p.Leu46Pro mutant PIGY protein in all tissues, which likely accounts for the severe, multi-system involvement.</p><p>There is growing recognition that autosomal recessive disorders of GPI biosynthesis are an important subclass of the congenital disorders of glycosylation. Over 150 proteins require GPI anchorage for cell-surface expression and all cell types in the body employ this anchoring mechanism (<xref rid="DDV331C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Previously published defects of GPI anchor biosynthesis present in infancy with multi-system disease, likely due to the wide range of biological processes affected by the reduced expression of GPI-APs. The findings in our patients help to understand the range of phenotypes that can arise (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="DDV331TB2">2</xref>). Common dysmorphic features found in a range of GPI anchorage disorders include bi-temporal narrowing, anteverted nares, depressed nasal bridge, long philtrum, high palate and a tented upper lip. The ears are commonly large with fleshy lobes and overfolded helices. Fifth finger clinodactyly and nail hypoplasia are commonly described. Seizures, moderate-to-severe developmental delay, growth failure and cerebral visual impairment are commonly described. Other common features include genitourinary defects, gastrointestinal dysfunction and cardiac defects (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="DDV331TB1">1</xref>). The sisters from Family A share many features with other inherited GPI anchor defects but are the first to be described with cataracts. The hyperphosphatasia often observed in inherited GPI deficiency occurred albeit mildly in the two affected individuals from Family A. When mature GPI available to precursor alkaline phosphatase was not sufficient, some alkaline phosphatase is transferred to water instead of GPI, resulting in secretion of soluble enzyme. Recently, it has been reported that pyridoxine may be effective in patients with mutations in PIGO (<xref rid="DDV331C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and butyrate may be effective in patients with PIGM (<xref rid="DDV331C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), raising important therapeutic considerations.

However, the absence of punctate calcification in our patients is inconsistent with this disorder. Plasmalogens were mildly elevated, phytanic acid was normal and DHAP-AT and DHAP-S activity on cultured skin fibroblasts was normal. Lipid remodelling of GPI anchors occurs in a later part of the GPI biosynthetic pathway and is dependent on the alkyl-phospholipid biosynthetic pathway in the peroxisome. Kanzawa <italic>et al.</italic> showed that patients with mutations in genes involved in peroxisomal biogenesis had defective GPI lipid remodelling and were unable to synthesize 1-alkyl-2-acyl GPIs (<xref rid="DDV331C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Unlike patients with RCDP1 and Zellweger syndrome, patients with p.Leu46Pro substitution in PIGY do not have defective GPI lipid remodelling and are able synthesize alkyl&#x2013;acyl GPI forms. Inherited GPI deficiencies are an important differential for peroxisomal disorders and GPI lipid remodelling might be used as a tool to differentiate between these two clinically similar disorders.</p><p>In Family B, even though we could restrict the search space to &lt;1% of the genome based on autozygosity, initial filtering of the 217 641 variants detected by WES did not yield any likely causative variants. It was only after extending our definition of &#x2018;deleterious&#x2019; to include 5&#x2032;-UTR variants that lie in regions annotated by the ENCODE consortium (<xref rid="DDV331C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) as transcription factor binding sites, that we uncovered the c.-540G&gt;A variant. UTR regions were not targeted by first-generation exome capture kits and even when capture probes are present in these regions, sequence coverage is often low due to high GC content (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv331/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</ext-link>). Although variants in these regions are becoming less refractory to detection as researchers switch from exome analysis to WGS, they remain difficult to interpret. Our detection of a functional homozygous 5&#x2032;-UTR variant, despite only having four good quality reads, thus represents an unanticipated finding that highlights the importance of developing better tools to analyse the non-coding portion of the genome.</p><p>In conclusion, we describe the first report of two different recessive mutations in the GPI biosynthesis gene <italic>PIGY</italic> that are associated with different phenotypes. The p.Leu46Pro mutation in the coding region of the <italic>PIGY</italic> causes a severe congenital, multi-system disorder resulting in early death, whilst the promoter mutation identified in Family B is associated with a moderate CNS phenotype compatible with life. This study contributes to understanding of the phenotype of disorders associated with deficiencies of the GPI-anchor glycosylation pathway, an important differential diagnosis in infants with multi-system disease, epileptic encephalopathy, dysmorphic facial features, brachytelephalangy and hyperphosphatasia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Genetic analysis</title><p>This research was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Children's Hospital at Westmead, Australia (10/CHW/45) and the Wales Research Ethics Committee, UK (12/WA/0001). WES was performed on genomic DNA from two sisters and their parents from Family A in collaboration with the Broad Institute using methods previously reported (<xref rid="DDV331C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In Family B, SNP-array-based autozygosity mapping was performed on all close family members using human CytoSNP12v2 (Illumina).

Skin fibroblast cells were grown in a Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Media (DMEM)/F12-HAMS supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and gentamicin (50 &#xB5;g/ml) and grown in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. To investigate levels of GPI-APs, cultured skin fibroblasts derived from Patient II-1 in Family A (a full thickness skin biopsy taken at 5 months), Patient II-2 in Family A (8 days) and three controls (ages 3.5 months, 5.5 months and 5.5 years) were treated with versene and incubated with allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated mouse anti-human CD55 and phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mouse anti-human CD59 antibodies (BD Biosciences) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) without calcium or magnesium and supplemented with 2% FBS for 30 min at 4&#xB0;C. Cells were then centrifuged at 250<italic>g</italic> for 5 min and washed twice in the above solution. Labelled cells were analysed using a CantoII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analysed using FlowJo&#x2122; v 7.6.5 software. Experiments were performed in triplicate from each cell line, and the results were averaged. Fibroblasts were not available from members of Family B and so whole blood samples were used instead. These were treated with ACK lysis buffer and stained with anti-human CD16 (Invitrogen); samples were run on a BD FACSCanto and data analysed by FlowJo. Granulocytes were identified according to FSc and SSc profile.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Functional analysis of mutant PIGY cDNA</title><p>Daudi cells (PIG-Y deficient human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line) expressing EBNA1 antigen (<xref rid="DDV331C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="DDV331C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) were permanently transfected with WT or c.137T&gt;C mutant PIG-Y constructs containing Epstein&#x2013;Barr virus oriP. For low level expression, <italic>PIGY</italic> cDNA was driven by minimum TATA box promoter in pTAL oriP puro PIGY.

After selection with 0.5 mg/ml of puromycin for 2 weeks, restoration of the surface expression of GPI-APs was determined by staining cells with mouse anti-human CD59 (5H8), human CD55 antibodies and each isotype IgG followed by a PE-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (mouse IgG1 and IgG2a, and secondary antibody were purchased from BD Biosciences) and analysed by flow cytometer (Canto II) using Flowjo software (Tommy Digital Inc., Tokyo, Japan). For high level expression, PIG-Y deficient Daudi cells were transiently transfected with WT or mutant (c.137T&gt;C) strong promoter-driven pME-oriP HA-PIGY. Two days later, restoration of the surface expression of CD59 was assessed by flow cytometry. Lysates were applied to SDS-PAGE, and western blotting was performed using anti-HA antibody (HA-7, Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The levels of protein expression were normalized with the intensities of glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), the loading control and luciferase activities used for evaluating transfection efficiencies.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>GPI mannolipid analysis</title><p>Patient and control fibroblasts were transformed using telomerase gene and SV40 large T gene and metabolically radiolabeled with tritiated mannose in the presence of tunicamycin to enhance incorporation into GPI mannolipids by preventing incorporation into more abundant N-glycan precursors.
