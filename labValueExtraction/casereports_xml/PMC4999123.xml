        <p>Evolution and cost of three types of compression therapy (single layer,
multilayer and Unna boot) in patients with venous ulceration were compared. The
evaluation lasted two months and used photographic records and instrument based
on pressure ulcer scale for healing (PUSH). Treatment with monolayer compression
therapy presented the lowest cost and more efficacy of the three types, with 82%
savings compared with the multilayer therapy.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The venous ulcer (VU) is a worldwide problem which causes considerable socioeconomic
impact, burdens health services and compromises life quality of patients and their
families. It represents 70% to 80% of leg ulcers.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Compression therapy is an efficient form of treatment for VU, because it can combine bed
care with the treatment of venous hypertension.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Due to the need of
understanding how the treatment of this type of lesion should be done - especially
compression therapy - and the choice of a product according to its cost, benefit and
adequacy to the patient's profile, this study had the objective of comparing the
evolution and cost of VU treatment using three types of compression therapy.</p>
    <p>Three different types of therapy were used with VU patients undergoing outpatient clinic
treatment. The patients were treated for practically the same length of time. The first
patient was treated with inelastic compression therapy with Unna boot for 63 days; the
second one was treated with multilayer compression therapy for 62 days; the third one
was treated with single-layer compression therapy for 62 days as well.</p>
    <p>For data collection, an evaluation instrument based on <italic>pressure ulcer scale for
healing</italic> (Push) and photographies were used.</p>
    <p>Unna boot therapy was applied in a 53-year-old patient, male, hypertensive, who presented
VU above the medial malleolus in the left lower limb (LLL) for the last four years. In
the first evaluation, before the first round of Unna boot therapy, the lesion had an
extension of 68 cm<sup>2</sup> and showed granulation tissue and copious exudate. The
primary dressing contained silver foam and barrier cream on the edges. In the last
evaluation, the ulcer measured 65.1 cm<sup>2</sup> and exhibited granulated tissue and
moderate exudate. The same type of primary dressing was maintained. For 11 applications,
the cost of Unna boot with the dressing was R$ 1.317,75. These was closure of 4.2% of
the lesion during the 63 days of treatment.</p>
    <p>Multilayer compressive therapy was applied on a 47-year-old patient, male, hypertensive,
with VU for three years, located in the lateral medial third of LLL. Before the first
application of the multilayer bandage system, the lesion measured 210.8 cm<sup>2</sup>
and contained slough and little exudate. In the primary dressing, nylon tissue with
silver was used, associated to polyurethane foam. In the last evaluation, the wound
measured 76.5 cm<sup>2</sup>, granulation tissue and moderate exudate. The primary
dressing was changed to polyurethane foam with silver and barrier cream at the edges.
The cost of 13 curatives with dressings and the multilayer system was R$ 5.331,11. The
closure of 63.7% of the lesion could be observed during the 62 days of treatment.</p>
    <p>Singlelayer compression therapy was used in a 62-year-old patient, female, hypertensive,
with VU for 12 years in the frontal part of LLL, between the malleoli. Before the first
application of singlelayer long-stretching elastic bandage, the lesion measured 21.1
cm<sup>2</sup>, with granulated tissue and moderate exudate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). The primary dressing was done with calcium alginate and
barrier cream at the borders. In the last evaluation, an ulcer spanned an area of 0.6
cm<sup>2</sup>, with epithelialized tissue and scarce exudate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Primary dressing was changed to polyurethane foam with
silver and barrier cream at the borders. At the end of 62 days of treatment, the cost of
21 curatives was R$ 958,62 and closure of the wound reached 97.1%.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The treatment with singlelayer long-stretching elastic bandage was the cheapest and the
most efficient of the three types. A study found that the use of singlelayer therapy can
save from 51% to 63% in costs in comparison with multilayer therapy.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In this study, there were savings of 82%
compared to multilayer therapy.</p>
    <p>Regarding cicatrization, the ulcer with the largest diameter in this study (210
cm<sup>2</sup>) on which the multilayer system was applied, presented 22.2% of
closure in only 62 days, which shows that the cure of this lesion was faster than in a
randomized study in which a VU of the same diameter was healed in 280 days through the
same system.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
    <p>For the patient who used the multilayer bandaging system, there was significant reduction
of pain and improvement in mobility, which allowed him not to use crutches, upon which
he depended to walk around, right after the start of the therapy.</p>
    <p>A review done by Cochrane Data Base concluded that the multicomponent systems are more
effective than singlecomponent ones, however the multicomponent systems that contain
elastic binding seem to be more effective than those with nonelastic
components.<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> This way, the
elastic therapy seems to be more effective for treating VU than Unna boot, apart from
the number of layers, which is confirmed in this study.</p>
    <p>This study revealed that therapy with single-layer bandage was the cheapest and with the
shortest time of cicatrization, being also a good option when the available financial
resources are scarce.</p>
