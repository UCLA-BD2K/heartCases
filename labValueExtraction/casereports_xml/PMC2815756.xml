        <p>
                        Short-term fasting (48 hours) was shown to be effective in protecting
                        normal cells and mice but not cancer cells against high dose chemotherapy,
                        termed Differential Stress Resistance (DSR), but the feasibility and effect
                        of fasting in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy is unknown. Here we
                        describe 10 cases in which patients diagnosed with a variety of
                        malignancies had voluntarily fasted prior to (48-140 hours) and/or
                        following (5-56 hours) chemotherapy. None of these patients, who received
                        an average of 4 cycles of various chemotherapy drugs in combination with
                        fasting, reported significant side effects caused by the fasting itself
                        other than hunger and lightheadedness. Chemotherapy associated toxicity was
                        graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
                        (CTCAE) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The six patients who
                        underwent chemotherapy with or without fasting reported a reduction in
                        fatigue, weakness, and gastrointestinal side effects while fasting. In
                        those patients whose cancer progression could be assessed, fasting did not
                        prevent the chemotherapy-induced reduction of tumor volume or tumor
                        markers. Although the 10 cases presented here suggest that fasting in
                        combination with chemotherapy is feasible, safe, and has the potential to
                        ameliorate side effects caused by chemotherapies, they are not meant to
                        establish practice guidelines for patients undergoing chemotherapy. Only
                        controlled-randomized clinical trials will determine the effect of fasting
                        on clinical outcomes including quality of life and therapeutic index.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Chemotherapy can extend survival in
                        patients diagnosed with a wide range of malignancies. However, side effects caused
                        by toxicity to normal cells and tissues limit chemotherapy dose
                        density and intensity, which may compromise efficacy. For instance, the
                        cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity associated with the widely prescribed
                        anti-cancer drugs, doxorubicin and cisplatin respectively limit their full
                        therapeutic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Thus, reduction of undesired toxicity by selective
                        protection of normal cells without compromising the killing of malignant cells
                        represents a promising strategy to enhance cancer treatment.

      <p>Calorie restriction (CR) is an
                        effective and reproducible intervention for increasing life span, reducing
                        oxidative damage, enhancing stress resistance and delaying/preventing aging and age-associated
                        diseases such as cancer in various species, including mammals (mice, rats, and
                        non- human primates) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Recently, a
                        fasting-based intervention capable of differentially protecting normal and
                        cancer cells against high-dose chemotherapy in cell culture and in
                        neuroblastoma-bearing mice was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. In the neuroblastoma xenograft model, mice were allowed to consume only
                        water for 48 hours prior to etoposide treatment. Whereas high dose etoposide
                        led to 50% lethality in <italic>ad libitum</italic> fed mice, fasting protected against
                        the chemotoxicity without compromising the killing of neuroblastoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].

      <p>Previous human studies have shown that alternate day
                        dietary restriction and short-term fasting (5 days) are well tolerated and safe
                        [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. In fact, children ranging from 6 months to 15 years of age were
                        able to complete 14 to 40 hours of fasting in a clinical study carried out at
                        the Children's hospital of Philadelphia
                        [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, alternate day calorie
                        restriction caused clinical improvements and reduced markers of inflammation
                        and oxidative stress in obese asthmatic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].

      <p>Here, we report 10 cases of
                        patients diagnosed with various types of cancer, who have voluntarily fasted
                        prior to and following chemotherapy. The results presented here, which are based on self-assessed health
                        outcomes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and laboratory reports,  suggest
                        that fasting is safe and raise the possibility that it can

                        This is a 51-year-old Caucasian woman
                                diagnosed with stage IIA breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemo-therapy
                                consisting of docetaxel (TAX) and cyclophosphamide(CTX). She fasted prior to her first
                                chemotherapy administration. The fasting regimen consisted of a complete
                                caloric deprivation for 140 hours prior and 40 hours after chemotherapy (180
                                hours total), during which she consumed only water and vitamins. The patient completed
                                this prolonged fasting without major inconvenience and lost 7 pounds,
                                which were recovered by the end of the treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>). After the
                                fasting-chemotherapy cycle, the patient experienced mild fatigue, dry mouth and
                                hiccups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>); nevertheless she was able to carry out her daily
                                activities (working up to 12 hours a day). By contrast,
                                in the subsequent second and third treatment, she  received chemotherapy accompanied by  a regular diet and complained of moderate to severe fatigue,
                                weakness, nausea, abdominal cramps and diarrhea (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>). This time the
                                side effects forced her to withdraw from her regular work schedule. For the
                                forth cycle, she opted to fast again, although with a different regimen which
                                consisted of fasting 120 hours prior to and 24 hours post
                                chemotherapy. Notably, her self-reported side effects were lower despite the expected
                                cumulative toxicity from previous cycles. Total white
                                blood cell (WBC) and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) were slightly better at
                                nadir when chemotherapy was preceded by fasting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, C; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ST1">1</xref>). Furthermore, platelets level decreased by 7-19% during cycles 2 and 3 (<italic>ad libitum</italic>
                                diet) but did not drop during the first and forthcycles (fasting), (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). After the forthchemotherapy cycle combined with
                                144-hour fast her ANC, WBC, and platelet counts reached their highest level since
                                the start of chemotherapy 80 days earlier (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, C and D).

        <title>Case 2</title>
        <p>This is a 68-year-old Caucasian male
                            diagnosed in February 2008 with esophageal adenocarcinomametastasic to
                            the left adrenal gland. The initial
                            treatment consisted of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) combined
                            with cisplatin(CDDP) concurrent with radiation for the first two cycles. Throughout these first two cycles, the
                            patient experienced multiple
                            side effects including
                            severe weakness, fatigue, mucositis, vomits and grade 2-3 peripheral neuropathy
                            (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). During the third cycle, 5-FU
                            administration was interrupted due
                            to severe nausea and refractory vomiting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In spite of the aggressive
                            approach with chemotherapy and radiation, his disease progressed with new
                            metastases to the right adrenal gland, lung nodules, left sacrum, and coracoid
                            process documented by computed tomography - positron emission tomography
                            (CT-PET) performed in August 2008. These prompted
                            a change in his chemotherapy regimen for the fourth cycle to carboplatin (CBDCA) in combination with TAX and 5-FU (96 hour infusion)
                            (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). During the fourth cycle, the patient incorporated a 72-hour fast
                            prior to chemotherapy and continued the fast for 51 hours afterward, consuming
                            only water. The rationale for the 51 hour post-chemotherapy fasting was to
                            cover the period of continuous infusion of 5-FU. The patient lost approximately 7
                            pounds, of which 4 were regained during the first few days after resuming <italic>ad
                                    libitum</italic> diet (data not shown). Although a combination of three
                            chemotherapeutic agents were used during this cycle, self-reported sideeffects were
                            consistently less severe compared to cycles in which calories were consumed ad
                            lib (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Prior to his fifth cycle the patient opted to fast again. Instead of receiving the 5-FU infusion for
                                96 hours, as he did previously, the same
                                dose of the drug was administered within
                                48 hours, and the fasting regimen was also modified to 48 hours prior and 56
                                hours post chemotherapy delivery. Self-reported side effects were again less
                                severe than those in association with  <italic>ad libitum</italic> diet and the
                                restaging CT-PET scan indicated objective tumor response, with decreased
                                standard uptake values (SUV) in the esophageal mass,the adrenal
                                gland metastases, and the lung nodule. From
                                the sixth to eight cycle, the
                                patient fasted prior to and following chemotherapy treatments
                                (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Fasting was well tolerated in all cycles and chemotherapy-dependent
                                side effects were reduced except for mild diarrhea and abdominal cramps that
                                were developed during the seventh cycle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).
                                Ultimately, the patient's disease progressed and the patient died in February
                                2009.

        <p>This is a 74-year-old Caucasian man who was diagnosed in July 2000 with stage II prostate
                            adeno-carcinoma, Gleason score 7 and
                            baseline PSA level of 5.8 ng/ml. He achieved an undetectable PSA nadir after radical prostatectomy performed in September of 2000, but
                            experienced biochemical recurrence inJanuary 2003 when
                            PSA rose to 1.4 ng/ml. Leuprolide acetate together
                            with bicalutamide
                            and finasteride
                            were prescribed. However, administration of these drugs had to be suspended in
                            April 2004 due to severe side effects related to testosterone
                            deprivation. Additional therapies including triptorelin pamoate, nilutamide, thalidomide, CTX and ketoconazole failed to
                            control the disease. In 2007 the patient's PSA level reached 9 ng/ml and new
                            metastases were detected on bone scan. Despite that TAX at 25mg/m<sup>2 </sup>was
                            administered on weekly basis,  the PSA level continued to increase, reaching
                            40.6 ng/ml (data not shown).  Bevacizumab was added to the treatment and only
                            then did the PSA drop significantly (data not shown). Throughout the cycles
                            with chemotherapy the patient experienced significant side effects including
                            fatigue, weakness, metallic taste, dizziness,
                                forgetfulness, short-term memory impairment and peripheral neuropathy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I</xref>). After discontinuing the
                                chemotherapy, his PSA rose rapidly. TAX was resumed at 75mg/m<sup>2 </sup>every 21 days, and was
                                complemented with granulocytic colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Once again
                                the patient suffered significant side effects (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I</xref>). In June 2008, chemotherapy was halted. The
                                patient was enrolled in a phase III clinical trial with abiraterone acetate, a drug that can selectively block CYP17, a microsomal enzyme thatcatalyzes
                                a series of reactions critical to nongonadal androgenbiosynthesis
                                [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. During the trial, the patient's PSA levels increased to 20.9ng/dl (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H</xref>), prompting resumption of chemotherapy and G-CSF. This time the patient opted to fast prior to
                                chemotherapy.  His fasting
                            schedule consisted
                            of 60 hours prior to and 24 post drug administration (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Upon restarting chemotherapy with fasting the PSA level dropped, and
                            notably, the patient reported considerably lower side effects than in previous
                            cycles in which he consumed calories ad-lib (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I</xref>). He also experienced reduced myelosuppression (Figure4A-G). During the last three cycles, in addition to fasting, the patient applied testosterone (cream, 1%) for
                            five days prior to chemotherapy. As a
                            consequence the PSA level along with the testosterone level increased dramatically. Nonetheless, 3 cycles of chemotherapy combined
                            with fasting reduced PSA from 34.2 to 6.43 ng/ml (Figure 4H). These results imply that the cytotoxic activity of TAX to cancer
                            cells was not blocked by fasting.

        <title>Case 4
                        </title>
        <p>This is a 61-year-old Caucasian
                            female who was diagnosed in June
                            2008 with poorly differentiated non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). A
                            staging PET scan documented a hypermetabolic lung mass, multiple mediastinal
                            and left perihilar lymph nodes, and widespread metastatic disease to the bones,
                            liver, spleen, and pancreas. The initial treatment
                            commenced with the administration of TAX 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and CBDCA 540mg every 21 days. Although she
                            was on a regular diet, during the first 5 cycles she lost an average of 4
                            pounds after each
                            treatment, most likely due to chemotherapy-induced
                            anorexia. The patient reported that she did return to her
                            original weight but only after three weeks of the drug administration, just
                            before a new cycle. Additional side effects included severe muscle spasms, peripheral neuropathy, significant
                            fatigue, mucositis, easy bruising and bowel discomfort (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref>). During the sixthcycle,which consisted of the same drugs and dosages, the patient fasted
                            for 48-hours-prior and 24-hours-post chemotherapy. She lost approximately 6
                            pounds during the fasting period, which she recovered within 10 days (data
                            not shown). Besides mild fatigue and weakness, the patient did not complain of
                            any other side effect which was experienced during the five previous cycles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref>). Cumulative side effects such as peripheral
                            neuropathy, hair loss and cognitive impairment were not reversed. By contrast
                            self-reported acute toxic side effects were consistently reduced when
                            chemotherapy was administered in association with fasting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref>). In the sixth and last cycle,  the patient reported that her strength returnedmore quickly after the chemotherapy so that she was able to walk 3 miles three days after the
                            drug administration, whereas in previous cycles (<italic>ad libitum</italic> diet) she had experienced severe
                            weakness and fatigue which limited any physical activity. No significant
                            differences were observed in the patient's blood analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>-G). The last PET scan performed on February 2009
                            showed stable disease in the main mass (lungs) and decreased uptake in the
                            spleen and liver when compared to her baseline study.

                            dissection) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy were recommended. Due to
                            significant enlargement of the right ureter, a right nephrectomy was also
                            performed. Post-operatively, six cycles of CBDCA (480mg) and paclitaxel (280mg)
                            were administered every 21-days. During the first treatment the patient
                            maintained her regular diet and experienced fatigue, weakness, hair loss,
                            headache and gastrointestinal discomfort (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). By contrast, during cycles

        <p>This is a 44-year-old Caucasian female diagnosed with a
                            right ovarian mass (10x12 cm.) in July 2007. Surgery (TAH-BSO) revealed stage
                            IA carcinosarcoma of the ovary with no lymph node involvement. Adjuvant
                            treatment consisted of six cycles of ifosfamide and CDDP, administered from July to November of 2007. She remained free of disease until an MRI
                            revealed multiple new pulmonary nodules in August 2008. Consequently chemotherapy with taxol,
                            carboplatin and bevacizumab was initiated. By November, however, a CT scan
                            showed progression of the cancer. Treatment was changed to gemcitabine plus TAX complemented with G-CSF
                            (Neulasta) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ST2">2</xref>). After the first dose of gemcitabine (900 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), the patient
                            experienced prolonged neutropenia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>) and thrombocytopenia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>), which forced a delay of day 8 dosing. During the second cycle the
                            patient received a reduced dose of gemcitabine (720 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), but again developed prolonged
                            neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, causing dose delays. For the third and subsequent cycles, the patient fasted
                            for 62 hours prior to and 24 hours after chemotherapy. The patient not only did
                            not find hardship on carrying out the fasting but also showed a faster recovery
                            of her blood cell counts, allowing the completion of the chemotherapy regimen
                            (gemcitabine 720mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1 plus gemcitabine 720mg/m<sup>2</sup>
                            and TAX 80mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 8). During the fifth cycle, she fasted under the same regimen and received
                            a full dose of gemcitabine (900mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and TAX (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ST2">2</xref>).
                             Her complete blood count showed consistent improvement during the cycles in
                                which chemotherapy was combined with fasting. A trend in which nadirs were
                                slightly less pronounced and the zeniths were considerably higher in ANC, lymphocyte and WBC counts was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, B, C, respectively; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ST2">2</xref>). During the first
                                and second cycle (<italic>ad
                                        libitum</italic> diet) gemcitabinealone induced prolonged thrombocytopenia, which took 11 and 12 days to
                                recover, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>;

                                subsequent cycles), the duration of thrombocytopenia was significantly shorter

        <p>This is a 66-year-old Caucasian male who was diagnosed
                            in July 1998 with prostate adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 8. A Prosta Scint
                            study performed in the same year displayed positive uptake of the radiotracer
                            in the right iliac nodes, consistent with stage D1 disease. The patient was
                            treated with leuprolide, bicalutamide and
                            finasteride. In December 2000, the
                            diseases progressed. He started on a second cycle with leuprolide acetate and also
                            received High Dose Rate (HDR) brachytherapy and external beam radiation with
                            Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) to the prostate and pelvis. In
                            April 2008, a Combidex scan revealed a 3 x 5 cm pelvic mass and left
                            hydronephrosis prompting initiation of TAX chemotherapy supplemented with G-CSF.  The patient received 60-75 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>of TAX for
                            8 cycles. Throughout this period the patient fasted for 60-66 prior to and 8-24 hours following chemotherapy(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Side
                            effects from fasting included grade one
                            lightheadedness (accordingly CTCAE 3.0) and a drop in blood
                            pressure, none of which interfered with his routine. Chemotherapy-associated
                            self-reported side effects included grade one sensory neuropathy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8I</xref>). The
                            patient's ANC, WBC,
                            platelet and lymphocyte levels remained in the normal range throughout
                            treatment, although he did develop anemia (Figure8A-G). PSA levels consistently decreased, suggesting that fasting did not interfere with
                            the therapeutic benefit of the chemo-treatment (Figure 8H).

      <p>Dietary recommendations during cancer
                        treatment are based on the prevention or reversal of nutrient deficiencies to
                        preserve lean body mass and minimize nutrition-related side effects, such as
                        decreased appetite, nausea, taste changes, or bowel changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].
                        Consequently, for cancer patients who
                        have been weakened by prior chemotherapy cycles or are emaciated, many
                        oncologists could consider a fasting-based
                        strategy to be potentially harmful.  Nevertheless studies in cell culture and animal models indicate
                        that fasting may actually reduce chemotherapy side effects by selectively
                        protecting normal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Following the publication of this pre-clinical work,several patients, diagnosed with a wide variety of cancers, elected to
                        undertake fasting prior to chemotherapy and shared their experiences with us.
                        In this heterogeneous group of men and women fasting was safely repeated in
                        multiple cycles for up to 180 hours prior and/or following chemotherapy. Minor
                        complaints that arose during fasting
                        included dizziness, hunger, and headaches at a level that did not interfere with daily activities. Weight lost
                        during fasting was rapidly recovered in most of the patients and did not lead
                        to any detectable harm.
                    
            </p>
      <p>We obtained self-reported assessments of toxicity from
                        all 10 patients who incorporated fasting with their chemotherapy treatments.
                        Since many of the chemotoxicities are cumulative, we evaluated serial data
                        including all the combined fasting- and non-fasting (<italic>ad libitum</italic> diet)
                        associated chemotherapy cycles (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SF1">1</xref>). Toxicity was graded
                        utilizing a questionnaire based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
                        Events of National Cancer Institute, version 3.0 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).  Although the lack of
                        prospective collection of toxicity data and grading are a significant
                        limitation, this series provide an early insight into the feasibility and
                        potential benefit of combining fasting with chemotherapy. Fewer and less severe
                        chemotherapy-induced toxicity was reported by all the patients, even though fasting cycles were often carried out in the later
                        portion of the therapy (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SF1">1</xref>). Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and
                        mucositis were virtually absent from the reports of all 10 patients in the
                        cycles in which fasting was undertaken prior to and/or following chemotherapy;
                        whereas at least one of these symptoms was reported by 5 out of the 6 patients
                        during cycles in which they ate <italic>ad libitum</italic> (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SF1">1</xref>). The four
                        patients that fasted throughout their treatments reported low severity for the
                        majority of the side effects, in contrast to the typical experience of cancer
                        patients receiving the same chemotherapy regimens (Figures 8I, 9, 10, 11H). For the 6 patients who received chemotherapy with or without
                        fasting, we compared the severity of the self-reported side effects in the 2
                        closest fasting/non-fasting (<italic>ad libitum diet</italic>) cycles in which the
                        patient received the same chemotherapy drugs at the same dose. There was a
                        general and substantial reduction in the self-reported side effects in
                        combination with fasting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Symptoms such as fatigue and weakness were
                        reported to be significantly reduced (p&lt; 0.001 and p&lt; 0.00193,
                        respectively), whereas vomiting and diarrhea were virtually absent in
                        combination with fasting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In addition, there was no side effect
                        whose average severity was reported to be increased during fasting-chemotherapy
                        cycles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SF1">1</xref><bold>)</bold>.
                    
            </p>
      <p>Challenging conditions such as fasting or
                        severe CR stimulate organisms to suppress growth and reproduction, and divert
                        the energy towards cellular maintenance and repair to maximize the chance of
                        survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. In simple organisms such as yeast, resistance to
                        oxidants and chemotherapy drugs can be increased by up to 10-fold in response
                        to fasting/starvetion and up to 1,000-fold in those cells lacking homologs of
                        Ras, AKT and S6 kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, such protection and oxidative stress
                        resistance is completely reversed by the expression of oncogene-like genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. In
                        mammals, the mechanism(s) responsible for the protective effect of fasting against
                        chemotherapy induced-toxic side effects is not completely understood. It may
                        involve reduction in anabolic and mitogenic hormones and growth factors such as
                        insulin and insuline-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) as well as up-regulation of
                        several stress resistance proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. In fact, mice with liver specific IGF-I
                        gene-deletion (LID) which have ~80% reduction of circulating IGF-I and mice
                        with genetic disruptions in the IGF-I receptor (heterozygous knockout <italic>IGF-IR</italic>
                        +/-) or its downstream elements have been shown to be more resistant against
                        multiple chemotherapy agents and oxidative stress, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].
                        Alternatively,  fasting-dependent DSR may be, in part, mediated by cell cycle arrest
                        in normal cells whereas transformed cells continue to proliferate, remaining
                        vulnerable to anticancer drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].  Although mutations driving cancer progression are
                        heterogeneous across tumor types, the majority of the oncogenic mutations
                        render cancer cells independent of growth signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], which we hypothesize
                        prevents cancer cells from responding to the fasting-induced switch to a
                        protected mode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Therefore, DSR would have the potential to be
                        applied independently of the cancer type. Although this has not been yet
                        demonstrated, the remarkable effects of fasting on the down-regulation of a
                        number of growth factors and signal transduction pathways targeted by
                        anti-cancer drugs, including IGF-I and the TOR/S6 kinase pathways, raises the possibility
                        that it could enhance the efficacy of cancer treatment drugs and may even be as
                        effective as some of them.
                    
            </p>
      <p>In summary, in this small and
                        heterogeneous group of cancer patients, fasting was well-tolerated and was
                        associated with a self-reported reduction in multiple chemotherapy-induced side
                        effects. Although bias could affect the estimation of the side effects by the
                        patients, the case reports presented here are in agreement with the results
                        obtained in animal studies and provide preliminary data indicating that
                        fasting is feasible, safe and has the potential to differentially protect
                        normal and cancer cells against chemotherapy in humans. Nevertheless, only a
                        clinical trial, such as the randomized controlled clinical trial currently
                        carried out at the USC Norris Cancer Cen-ter, can establish whether fasting
                        protects normal cells and increases the therapeutic index of chemotherapies.

      <p>From April 2008 to August 2009, 10 unrelated patients
                        diagnosed with a variety of cancer volunteered to incorporate fasting with
                        their chemo-treatments. We invited these patients to complete a self-assessment
                        survey based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events of The
                        National Cancer Institute version 3.0. For the purpose of this study only, we
                        developed a questionnaire that contained 16 easy identifiable and commonly
                        reported side effects; the seriousness of the symptoms was graded from 0 to 4
                        with each consecutive number corresponding to no side
                        effect/mild/moderate/severe and life threatening. Adverse effects were further
                        divided into 3 major categories including, general, gastrointestinal and
                        central/peripheral nervous system side effects, (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, original
                        questionnaire). The survey was delivered to patients by mail, e mail or fax and
                        every patient was instructed to complete it 7 days after each treatment cycle.
                        Explanation and assistance to patient's concern were offered throughout the
                        study. The eligibility criterion to participate was subjected to those patients
                        that had voluntarily fasted prior and/or post chemotherapy. Medical records
                        including basic demographical information, diagnosis, treatments, imaging
                        studies and laboratory analysis were also retrospectively reviewed (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).  All
                        the aforementioned procedures were in compliance with the Internal review Board
