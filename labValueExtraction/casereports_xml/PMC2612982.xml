      <abstract>
        <p>Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes (sinus histiocytosis with massive
lymphadenopathy) disease is an uncommon disease characterized
by benign proliferation of histiocytes, with painless lymph
node enlargement and frequent extranodal disease. Orbital
involvement occurs in 9-11% of cases. However, isolated Rosai-
Dorfman-Destombes disease of the lacrimal gland without any
systemic involvement is very rare with only three case reports.
We describe here one such young male patient with unilateral
lacrimal gland swelling. Excision biopsy revealed almost complete
replacement of the lacrimal gland by lymphocytes, plasma cells
and large pale histiocytes. The latter exhibited emperipolesis and
stained positive for S-100 and CD68 on immunohistochemistry.
Patient is well and has no other manifestation or recurrence of the
disease during a follow-up of 24 months.</p>

    <p>Destombes in 1965 reported four cases of &#x2033;adenitis with lipid
excess&#x2033;, in children and young adults<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> which went unnoticed
till Rosai and Dorfman four years later characterized the unique
pathological features of this rare lymph nodal disorder which
they called sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
Extranodal involvement of one or multiple tissues and organs
by this Rosai Dorfman or more appropriately Rosai-Dorfman-
Destombes (RDD) disease can occur. Even though the head
and neck region is commonly involved, its occurrence in the
lacrimal gland is rare. Isolated involvement of lacrimal gland
without lymph nodal involvement is even rarer with only
three case reports in the literature till date.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
Because of this extremely unusual occurrence we present here one such case
report of a young male who presented with swelling in the
lacrimal gland region.</p>
    <sec sec-type="">
      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>A 38-year-old man presented with a swelling in the left upper
eyelid for three years. The mass was painless and slowly
progressive. There was no history of fever or any other systemic
involvement. Clinical examination of the left eye revealed
mild proptosis and downward and inward dystopia. Fundus
examination was normal. The other eye was completely normal.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit showed an
extraconal mass in the left lacrimal gland region abutting the
left globe and pushing it anteriorly and medially [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].
The optic nerves, chiasma and rectus muscles revealed normal
MRI signals. Comparison with the previous MRI scans done
three and two years earlier showed no significant change in size
of the lesion. The other orbit was normal. Complete surgical
excision of the mass was carried out. A single nodular tissue
measuring 2.5 &#xD7; 2 &#xD7; 1.5 cm was received for histopathological
examination. Its cut surface was homogeneous, smooth and
grey white. Routinely stained tissue sections revealed a lesion
comprising nodular aggregates of small lymphocytes and diffuse
occasional aggregates [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2A">2A</xref>]. In between these were many
large foamy histiocytes, some of which had lymphocytes and
plasma cells entrapped within the cytoplasm (emperipolesis)
[Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2B">2B</xref>]. Hyalinized collagen bands along with proliferated
myofibroblasts were also present. Most of the lacrimal gland was
destroyed by the disease except for a few entrapped remnants of
lacrimal ducts [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2C">2C</xref>]. Immunostaining showed the foamy
histiocytes to be strongly positive for S-100 protein [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2D">2D</xref>]
and CD68. A diagnosis of RDD disease involving the left lacrimal
gland was made. A follow-up of about 24 months was available
after surgical resection of mass. There has been no recurrence,
neither has the patient developed any lymphadenopathy or any
other systemic organ involvement.</p>

    <sec sec-type="">
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes disease or sinus histiocytosis with
massive lymphadenopathy (SHML) is a rare non-neoplastic
proliferative disorder of histiocytes that affects predominantly
children and young adults, with a slight male predominance.
Nearly 87% of patients have bilateral cervical painless
lymphadenopathy; other nodal groups are less frequently
involved.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> In some cases these extranodal manifestations
represent the predominant or even exclusive manifestation of
the disease. Practically all organ systems have been recorded
as being the site of the disease. The most common are eyes
and ocular adnexa. Classically, other sites include skin, upper
respiratory tract, salivary gland, epidural space, bone and
orbital soft tissue.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> The most frequent manifestation is an orbital
soft tissue mass with proptosis. To the best of our knowledge,
there are only three case reports with isolated lacrimal gland
involvement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> In the earlier three case reports along
with our present case the lacrimal gland involvement was unilateral.
In our present case, the lacrimal gland mass was very well
circumscribed with no extension into orbital soft tissues.</p>
      <p>Typically, RDD disease undergoes spontaneous remission
after a protracted course but may develop recurrences. Rarely,
the involvement of vital organ may lead to death. In our cases
no further treatment was given after surgical resection of the
mass. No recurrence or any lymphadenopathy was noted in a
follow-up period of 24 months.</p>
      <p>The etiology is still unknown. Viruses like Epstein-Barr virus
and Human Herpes virus 6 have been suggested. Molecular
studies done on involved tissue have failed to show evidence
of clonality in keeping with their presumed reactive nature.</p>
      <p>Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes disease presents in its most
typical form as lymph node involvement with sinus
histiocytosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> It is important to be familiar with the clinical
and diagnostic histopathologic features of this entity especially
when the disease presents extra-nodally in an isolated form.
Histopathologic features include the presence of lymphoid
aggregates altering with pale-appearing areas composed of
histiocytes and plasma cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></p>
      <p>The diagnosis is based on the identification of large
histiocytic cells showing emperipolesis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> Emperipolesis is the
presence of intact lymphocytes, plasma cells, erythrocytes or
polymorphonuclear leukocytes engulfed within the cytoplasm
of the histiocytes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></p>
      <p>Immunohistochemical stains are useful in differentiating
RDD disease from other histiocytic disorders. The RDD
histiocytes are strongly positive for S-100 and CD 68 as was
observed in our case. No immunoreactivity to CD1a is observed
(CD1a is expressed in Langerhans cells).</p>
      <p>To summarize, eyes and ocular adnexa, including lacrimal
gland involvement represent the most common extranodal
areas affected by RDD disease. This disease is not considered
as fatal. In many cases, RDD undergoes quick and complete
spontaneous resolution. In others, it follows a protracted
clinical course for years or decades. This latter is particularly
true in cases with widespread extranodal involvement.</p>
