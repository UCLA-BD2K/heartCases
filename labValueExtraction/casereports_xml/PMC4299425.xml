      <abstract>
        <p>The decision on whether starting an orthosurgical treatment depends on the negative
esthetic, functional and social impact the dentofacial deformity has on the quality
of life of each patient. The objective of this article is to demonstrate the
importance of assessing the quality of life of these individuals by means of applying
specific questionnaires before treatment onset in order to increase the success rate
of orthosurgical treatment. These questionnaires assess not only the esthetic factor,
but also the functional conditions that may be affected as well as the psychological
issues related to self-esteem and sociability, all of which must be assessed in order
to enable the development of an individual treatment plan that meets patient's
expectations. Thus, a more predictable level of satisfaction can be achieved at
treatment completion, not only from a normative standpoint stated by professionals,
but also from a subjective standpoint stated by patients. Although not enough
comparable data is available in the literature for us to assess the extent of
improvements produced by orthosurgical treatment, a few recent reports conducted by
different universities around the world reveal a good response from the majority of
patients after surgery, demonstrating great satisfaction with regard to esthetic,
functional and psychosocial factors. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the
current objective of orthodontic treatment associated with orthognathic surgery
consists not only in treating the esthetic functional components of dentofacial
deformities, but also in considering patients' psychological factor.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Facial esthetics strongly influences personal and professional relations, especially in
school and professional environments, from childhood to adulthood.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Patients with severe malocclusions are
dissatisfied with their physical appearance, particularly with their face.<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In cases of dentofacial deformities, in
which patients wish to significantly change their face and solve their functional
problems, orthosurgical treatment is the most suitable option.</p>
      <p>Although the vast majority of published articles only highlight the surgical techniques
available, assessing the effects of dentofacial deformities and orthosurgical treatment
on the psyche of each patient is essential. Additionally, it is highly necessary that
psychological and functional issues, social interaction trouble, low self-esteem and
other negative impact that hinder patient's quality of life be identified.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The concept of "quality of life" was defined in 1993 by the World Health Organization as
the perception of people with regard to their situation in life, within the cultural
context and values with which they live, in relation to their objectives, expectations,
patterns and concerns.<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Quality of
life is essentially a subjective concept that cannot be judged by others.</p>
      <p>According to the current paradigm of evidence-based Dentistry, all treatment procedures
must be based on the systematic assessment of clinically relevant scientific evidence
available which include patients' current condition, medical/dental history, treatment
needs and preferences. Although the demand for orthosurgical treatment is strongly
related with patients' chief complaint about their appearance, as well as with
psychological and social interaction issues, assessments on the need for treatment give
little emphasis on patients' perception and on how much treatment can improve their oral
health-related quality of life.<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The ideal would be to implement objective clinical indexes as well as subjective indexes
assessing the impact of dentofacial deformities on the daily routine of affected
individuals. The results would reflect patients' demand and guide the priorities of
public healthcare systems. Private practice allows orthodontists and dental surgeons to
have a better understanding of patients' chief complaints and expectations with regard
to treatment outcomes, allowing professionals to develop more personal treatment plans,
with higher levels of foreseeability regarding patients' satisfaction at treatment
completion.<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p>
      <sec>
        <title>Motivations of patients who seek orthosurgical treatment</title>
        <p>Over the years, studies have demonstrated that most patients with dentofacial
deformities seek treatment in order to have their facial and dental esthetics
improved.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Additionally,
some studies report that the main motivation comprises improvements in masticatory
function rather than changes in appearance.<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Patients also seek treatment with the expectation of gaining
psychosocial benefits, including improvements in interpersonal relationships and
psychological well-being, by improving their self-esteem.<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Some patients may have unreal expectations with specific objectives such as
professional growth or romantic relationships. These cases are often related with
previous frustrating experiences which the individual relates to the presence of his
dentofacial deformities. These patients overestimate the influence this treatment has
over their lives,which must be identified during the first interview conducted by
both orthodontist and dental surgeon in order to prevent a possible misunderstanding
between professionals and patients.</p>
        <p>In spite of that, the most common situation identified in epidemiologic research as
well as in orthodontic clinics is that patients expect to have improvements in their
psychological well-being and their interpersonal relationships without directing
their expectations towards unreal situations.</p>
        <p>Available scientific literature investigating the theme agrees that patients believe
that their lives will improve after orthodontic treatment.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Therefore, patients' subjective expectations, which considerably differ from those of
orthodontists as well as from oral and maxillofacial surgeons, must be investigated
before any intervention is carried out.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>

        <title>How to evaluate oral health-related quality of life?</title>
        <p>Quality of life instruments can be addressed by direct or telephone interviews,
self-filling questionnaires or, should the individual not be able to answer the
questions himself, questionnaires filled in by other people.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The most widely used method is the
questionnaire filled in by the patient himself, given that this method reduces the
chances of interference. Each questionnaire focuses on a different aspect of quality
of life evaluation: General health, oral health or specific health according to the
condition under study (for instance, orthosurgical treatment).</p>
        <p>The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a general
quality of life instrument that assesses the impact of a problem, treatment or
intervention over patients' general health perception. It comprises psychiatric
questions of more widespread and less specific perception, and is mainly used by
Medical Sciences to compare different populations, although its use is limited in
Dentistry. Its 36 items assess 8 domains divided into two groups: Physical
(functional capacity, physical aspects, pain and general health status) and mental
(mental health, vitality, as well as psychosocial and emotional aspects). Its scoring
varies from 0 (no negative impact on quality of life) to 100 (the worst quality of
life possible).<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Among the questionnaires used to assess the impacts on oral health-related quality of
life, the most widely used is the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP) developed in
Australia by Slade et al,<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and
which assess the individual's perception regarding discomfort and dysfunction caused
by oral conditions. Its 49 items are divided into seven dimensions: Functional
limitation, physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical incapacity,
psychological incapacity, social incapacity and difficulty doing usual jobs. Its
short version, known as OHIP-14, was published in 1997<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and comprises fourteen questions that assess the same
seven dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig 1</xref>). The interviewee must
score points to each question according to the frequency with which he is affected: 0
= never; 1 = hardly ever; 2 = occasionally; 3 = fairly often and 4 = very often. The
sum of points for the 14 questions gives the final OHIP-14 score which may vary
between 0 and 56, in which 0 means absence of negative impact and 56 means the worst
negative impact on oral health-related quality of life. The Brazilian version of the
OHIP-14 proved to have psychometric properties that are similar to the original
questionnaire.<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p>

        </fig>
        <p>The Orthognathic Quality of Life Questionnaire (OQLQ) was developed and validated by
Cunningham et al<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> whose objective was to assess the impact of
dentofacial deformities and the benefits of orthosurgical treatment on patients'
quality of life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig 2</xref>). This questionnaire has
been widely used in researches<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and comprises 22 questions divided into four domains: Facial
esthetics, oral function, awareness of facial esthetics and social aspects. Patients
can choose the option "it does not bother me" (0 points) or, should they be affected
by any of the issues, they use a 4-point scale of which answers vary from "it bothers
me a little" (1 point) to "it bothers me a lot" (4 points). OQLQ total score can vary
from 0 to 88. A lower score suggests improvements in quality of life, whereas a
higher score suggests that the quality of life has become worse. The OQLQ has already
been translated into Brazilian Portuguese<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> with its
psychometric properties being kept. Thus, the B-OQLQ is an instrument that must be
used when assessing Brazilian orthodontic-surgical patients.</p>

        <title>How is the quality of life of patients with dentofacial deformities?</title>
        <p>Combined orthodontic and orthognathic surgery therapy is the most appropriate
treatment option for patients with facial deformities, given that it allows facial
harmony to be established by surgical repositioning of jaw bones. Another treatment
option includes orthodontic camouflage, however, this therapy only acts in dental
positioning and inclination, improving intercuspation without significant changes in
facial esthetics.</p>
        <p>Improvements in facial esthetics have been considered the main motivating factor for
patients seeking orthosurgical treatment.<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Such desire is explained by the role esthetics plays in
interpersonal and professional relationships,<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> which suffer social and psychological implications when facial
deformities are present.<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In other
words, patients with dentofacial deformities are subject to prejudgment that may
hinder their social relations and influence their self-body image.<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Self-body image comprises two elements: The first is the individual's self-image seen
in a mirror or in a photograph; while the second, and most important, is how the
individual feels towards his features. Patients with a positive self-body image have
higher chances of presenting more realistic expectations towards the outcomes of
corrective procedures to which they will undergo in comparison to patients with a
negative self-image.<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> It is
essential that clinicians clearly understand the expectations of patients who seek
orthosurgical treatment, given that such therapy causes significant changes in
individuals' body image. Should the dental surgeon and the orthodontist in charge be
unaware of patients' expectations, or should any desires related to the therapy not
be accomplished by the end of treatment, the outcomes may end up being very
frustrating, even if the objectives initially set by the professionals, by means of
normative indexes, are achieved.<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>
        <p>That is how the application of specific questionnaires aimed at assessing
orthodontic-surgical patients' quality of life in clinical practice can contribute to
diagnosis and treatment planning. These instruments assess not only esthetic aspects,
but also functional conditions that may have been affected (for instance,
mastication, speech and breathing) as well as psychological issues related to
self-esteem and sociability.<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>

        <title>Impact of orthosurgical treatment on quality of life</title>
        <p>Recent reports focusing on patients' satisfaction demonstrate good response after
surgery, which has been confirmed by many authors.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Nevertheless, lack of comparable data
to assess the extent of improvements produced by orthosurgical treatment has been one
of the main issues with regard to the available literature. This is mainly due to
lack of consensus between the different indexes used to assess such
changes.<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>

        <p>By applying the OHIP-14 questionnaire, Esper&#xE3;o et al<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> observed that non-treated individuals seeking
orthosurgical treatment suffered 6.5 times more negative impact on their quality of
life than patients who had received orthosurgical treatment. In spite of presenting
progressive worsening of occlusal aspects, patients who were undergoing orthodontic
surgical preparation already presented improvements in quality of life, with three
times more negative impact than operated patients. It is worth noting that women were
the most affected in the pre-treatment phase.</p>
        <p>These results were similar to those obtained by Rusanen et al<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> who also detected by means of the
OHIP-14 questionnaire that patients with facial deformities had more impact on their
oral health-related quality of life than the general population, out of which female
patients cared more about the opinion of other people.</p>
        <p>Assessment of 93 Class II orthosurgical patients revealed significant improvements in
quality of life during orthodontic preparation and post-surgical follow-up phases.
Comparison of data obtained 2 years before and 5 years after surgery revealed no
significant changes, thus demonstrating stability of patients' quality of life. The
psychosocial dimension was more positively affected than physical and functional
aspects.<sup><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p>
        <p>A prospective analysis of changes in the quality of life (assessed by OQLQ and
OHIP-14) of 36 Class III malocclusion patients subjected to orthosurgical
treatment<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> revealed
progressive reduction in OQLQ scoring six weeks after surgery, six months after
surgery and at treatment completion.</p>
        <p>However, OHIP-14 scoring revealed an important reduction only six weeks and six
months after surgery. General quality of life, assessed by means of SF-36, also
revealed significant improvements in mental health six months after surgery as well
as in physical aspects six weeks after surgery. Thus, orthosurgical treatment was
considered effective, producing significant psychosocial and functional improvements
for patients.<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Lee et al<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> also observed
significant decrease in patients' general quality of life during the first six weeks
after orthognathic surgery. Nevertheless, such decrease was transitory, and six
months after surgery patients presented significant improvements.</p>
        <p>A prospective analysis of 65 English patients who underwent orthosurgical treatment
demonstrated significant gain in oral health-related quality of life, even during
orthodontic preparation for surgery, despite the fact that the occlusal aspects
progressively worsened. In the post-operative phase, oral health-related quality of
life considerably improved. The most affected dimensions were: Social aspects,
dentofacial esthetics and masticatory function.<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p>
        <p>In the United States, Flanary et al<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> observed significant gain in patients' self-concept and
self-image after orthosurgical treatment, with reduction in the incidence of
personality disorders, psychosis and neurosis. Such gain remained even two years
after surgery.</p>
        <p>In Brazil, Costa et al<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>
corroborated these results by observing significant improvements in self-image and
self-esteem of 15 patients who underwent orthognathic surgery. The majority of
patients assessed sought treatment after being referred by other dentists or
orthodontists. Family psychological support was of paramount importance for patients'
recovery, and after surgery, patients observed major changes in their facial features
as well as in their self-esteem. Most esthetic and functional problems reported by
patients were corrected after surgery.</p>
        <p>Orofacial pain reports are usually associated with skeletal disharmony. Patients
subjected to orthosurgical treatment reported improvements in masticatory function,
speech and facial esthetics as well as reduction in articular and myofacial
pain.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Alves e Silva et al<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> assessed the
level of satisfaction of surgery performed in 15 orthosurgical Brazilian patients
aged between 17 and 35 years old. Most patients (93%) claimed that surgery met their
expectations, 33% had complaints with regard to the post-operative phase, especially
in the first 24 hours after surgery (67%), whereas 60% complained about their eating
habits in the first week after surgery (47%) and during maxillomandibular block with
rubber bands (33%). As for social relations, 60% mentioned that they did not change,
while 20% reported a slight increase and 20% reported a great increase.</p>
        <p>Murphy et al<sup><xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> used the Global
Transition Scale (GTS) to assess whether patients' conditions improved or worsened
after surgery. Patients who underwent surgery reported to have improvements in the
following aspects: Facial appearance (93%), masticatory function (64%), oral health
welfare (60%) and speech (32%).</p>
        <p>According to evidence available, it is clear that self-image continues to be
positively affected during a long period of time after orthosurgical
treatment.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Nevertheless, improvements in self-image tend to
decline when orthodontic finishing lasts for more than nine months. After this
period, patients have already recovered from surgery and present functional as well
as nutritional improvements. However, feeling that the treatment is incomplete causes
some discomfort, which may influence the benefits obtained and negatively affect
patients' quality of life. Despite being temporary, negative feelings originating
from presurgical orthodontic preparation are significant issues with which patients
must deal with. In addition, they are considered the worst disadvantage of this type
of treatment, given that they cause patients' esthetic and functional conditions to
worsen.<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
        <p>In conventional orthosurgical treatment, the presurgical orthodontic preparation
phase is considered the worst aspect of treatment. It requires dental tipping
decompensation and adaptation, in addition to significantly worsening patients'
dentofacial aspects, thus producing negative esthetic and social impact and, as a
consequence, worsening the social conditions already observed before treatment onset,
which may lead to an intense feelings of disadvantage.<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
        <p>This preparation phase lasts for about 17 months, but may be carried out for a period
not greater than two years.<sup><xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> It
results in an ideal decompensation of dental tipping, space consolidation and
coordination between the arches, thus allowing the best skeletal correction as well
as the greatest possible stability.<sup><xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Once an appropriate, precise and stable occlusion has been
achieved in order not only to allow the orthognathic surgery to be carried out, but
also perfectly align the arches, only minor adjustments are left for the postsurgical
phase.<sup><xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p>
        <p>According to the literature, the postsurgical phase of conventional treatment lasts
between seven and twelve weeks, and no changes regarding patients' age, sex and type
of malocclusion were found to significantly change this duration.<sup><xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> For Kiyak,<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> the postsurgical treatment phase should not last for
a period longer than nine months, since it could impair patients' psychological
improvements.</p>
        <p>According to Hern&#xE1;ndez-Alfaro et al,<sup><xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> the presurgical preparation phase may be even more harmful for
patients with Class III malocclusion, given that mandibular prognathism results in
dental decompensation that strongly emphasizes skeletal disharmony in these patients.
In spite of that, patients with Class III malocclusion tend to prevail among
Brazilian patients with skeletal malocclusion who seek orthodontic
treatment.<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Some authors observed improvements during the preparation phase, however, their data
have not been completely explained. For instance, by conducting a prospective
analysis, Cunningham et al<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>
concluded that orthosurgical treatment resulted in significant gains in OHRQoL of
patients with dentofacial deformities. Patients' presurgical analysis revealed that a
significant gain was obtained during presurgical orthodontic preparation in
comparison with the results of the first examination, although the occlusal aspects
progressively worsened. The second analysis was carried out six to eight weeks after
orthodontic treatment finishing and, consequently, after orthognathic surgery was
performed and the appliance was removed. It revealed significant improvements in oral
health-related quality of life, which were greater than those found in previous
analyses. The aspects that contributed the most for such important improvements in
OHRQoL were: Social aspects, esthetics and masticatory function.</p>
        <p>Despite being temporary, negative feelings originating from presurgical orthodontic
preparation are significant issues with which patients must deal with. In addition,
they are considered the worst disadvantage of this type of treatment, given that they
cause patients' esthetic, functional and social conditions to become considerably
worse than their initial malocclusion, the reason why they sought
treatment.<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the impacts must cease to exist if the benefits obtained with surgery
can be achieved within a shorter period of time by the "Anticipated Benefit"
protocol.<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> This protocol aims at foreseeing the magnitude of the
skeletal changes that are necessary for treatment to be carried out, with
orthognathic surgery being performed right after the orthodontic appliance has been
placed. Orthognathic treatment (arch alignment and leveling) can only be performed
after orthognathic surgery has been carried out. Theoretically, the tension and
anxiety of going through orthodontic surgery preparation would cease to exist and the
patient would experience the benefits of treatment more quickly, however, specific
studies are warranted to confirm such hypothesis.</p>
        <p>Feu<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> compared the effects of two
orthosurgical treatment protocols on the quality of life of 16 patients with Class
III skeletal malocclusion during two years. The protocols were equally divided into
two groups: Conventional treatment and anticipated benefit protocol. The main finding
of this research was that the quality of life and esthetic self-perception of
patients comprising the groups treated by the anticipated benefit protocol were
significantly superior to those comprising the conventional treatment group during
all assessment periods. Data were first assessed one month after treatment had been
performed, during a two-year follow-up. These data revealed that, to date, treatment
performed with the anticipated benefit protocol has a more positive psychosocial
impact than conventional orthosurgical treatment. After two years, patients
comprising the anticipated benefit protocol group were either undergoing the final
stages of orthodontic finishing or had treatment already completed, and were then in
retention. Conversely, none of the patients comprising the conventional group had
been subjected to surgery and their quality of life had considerably become worse due
to extended preparation time and worse occlusal conditions. It is still unknown
whether or not, after surgery, patients comprising the conventional treatment group
will have quality of life scores and esthetic self-perception similar or better than
those of patients comprising the anticipated benefit protocol group, given that their
occlusal condition will be better after surgery due to presurgical orthosurgical
treatment preparation.</p>
        <p>According to evidence available, patients with dentofacial deformities present
significant improvements in self-image after orthosurgical treatment, which continues
to be positively affected during a long period of time after orthosurgical
treatment.<sup><xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Nevertheless,
improvements in self-image tend to significantly decline when orthodontic finishing
lasts for more than nine months, in which case treatment seems to be incomplete. As
reported by Kiyak et al,<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> in these
cases, patients are no longer satisfied with treatment outcomes and present a
reduction in their self-esteem and self-image, which theoretically is a result of
losing psychological welfare. After this period of nine months, patients have already
recovered from surgery and present functional as well as nutritional improvements,
however, feeling that the treatment is incomplete causes discomfort, which may
influence the benefits obtained.<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Additional studies are warranted to
confirm whether or not these effects affect patients' OHRQoL.</p>
        <p>Likewise, after six months, patients subjected to conventional orthosurgical
treatment had mandibular movements as well as condylar displacement fully
recovered.<sup><xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> These are
important indicators of masticatory efficiency and adjustment of the
temporomandibular joint which, in turn, may be related to the functional dimensions
of the quality of life questionnaires, although no scientific evidence has yet proved
such a fact.<sup><xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Additional studies
are warranted to further investigate the masticatory efficiency of patients treated
with the anticipated benefit protocol. Therefore, assessing the functional dimensions
of quality of life may provide important information on the adaptation of these
patients during the postsurgical phase.</p>
        <p>Longitudinal studies conducted with patients subjected to orthodontic treatment,
regardless of the period of assessment, revealed that worse occlusal relationships
were significantly related to a worse perception in oral health-related quality of
life.<sup><xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> In case of patients treated with the anticipated
benefit protocol, even after skeletal relationships and unpleasant esthetics had been
corrected, patients' occlusion remained unbalanced and their masticatory function
stability became worse.<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>
Therefore, additional studies are necessary to further investigate patients'
perception in this new treatment condition, not comparable to any other type of
treatment that has been previously investigated.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORTS</title>
      <p>Due to being an elective procedure, the decision of undergoing an orthosurgical
treatment not only depends on patients' opinion, but also on their family's and on
negative impact of the dentofacial deformity, whether esthetic, functional or social.
For this reason, patients' expectations play an important role in predicting treatment
final outcomes, given that their satisfaction is theoretically related to reduction or
elimination of the factors that led them seek treatment. Thus, how can orthodontists or
oral and maxillofacial surgeons be successful in performing an orthosurgical treatment
that results in psychosocial gains for patients without knowing the impact caused by
their dentofacial deformity?</p>
      <p>Three cases of orthodontic-surgical patients treated at the Orthodontic Clinic of the
State University of Rio de Janeiro, including normative and quality of life data, are
reported herein. They demonstrate how joined analysis allows a more individualized
treatment conduct to be carried out.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>Case report 1</title>
        <p>Caucasian, male, 22-year old patient sought treatment complaining about his
dentofacial esthetics. As shown in his initial photographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig 3</xref>), he presented Class III malocclusion, maxillary deficiency
and mandibular excess.</p>
        <fig id="f03" orientation="portrait" position="float">

          <graphic xlink:href="dpjo-19-01-0123-g03"/>
        </fig>
        <p>His oral health-related quality of life was assessed by means of the OHIP-14 which
scored 31 points (an index that varies from 0 to 56 points), and the B-OQLQ which
scored 73 points (from 0 to 88 points), thus suggesting a considerably negative
impact. For this reason, orthosurgical treatment was planned with the anticipated
benefit protocol<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> in order to
quickly improve patient's facial esthetics.<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>
        <p>An orthodontic appliance was placed and surgery associating maxillary advancement and
mandibular setback was performed immediately after that.</p>
        <p>After two years and seven months of treatment, the orthodontic appliance was removed.
Satisfied with the final outcomes and the dental alignment obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Fig 4</xref>), the patient scored 4 points in the OQLQ
and 4 points in the OHIP-14, which means he presented extremely significant
improvements in oral health-related quality of life. In this case, the correct
diagnosis of objective clinical data and patient's subjective perception led to
successful orthosurgical treatment not only from a professional point of view, but
also from a most important prospect, the patient's.</p>

        <title>Case report 2</title>
        <p>Non-Caucasian male, 26-year-old patient sought treatment complaining about his dental
esthetics. As shown by his initial records (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig
5</xref>), he presented Class II malocclusion, mild mandibular retrognathia and +6 mm
overjet. He was considered a borderline case for which both treatment options were
available: Orthognathic surgery and orthodontic camouflage. The patient was unsure about
which treatment he should choose, but ended up opting for orthosurgical treatment with
the expectation that it would yield better results.</p>
        <fig id="f05" orientation="portrait" position="float">
          <label>Figure 5</label>

          <graphic xlink:href="dpjo-19-01-0123-g05"/>
        </fig>
        <p>His oral health-related quality of life was assessed. He scored 8 points in the B-OQLQ
(from 0 to 88 points) and 11 points in the OHIP-14 (from 0 to 56 points), which
suggested a minor negative impact on his oral health-related quality of life possibly
due to presenting a slightly severe dentofacial deformity. A conventional orthosurgical
treatment protocol was planned.</p>
        <p>An orthodontic appliance was placed and after a preparation that lasted for 2 years and
5 months, mandibular advancement was carried out. The appliance was removed after a
6-month postsurgical orthodontic finishing phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f06">Fig
6</xref>). The patient reported no significant facial alterations and complained
about postsurgical discomfort more often than the other patients did. After treatment,
he scored 24 points in the OQLQ and 14 points in the OHIP-14, which meant his oral
health-related quality of life became slightly worse.</p>

          <graphic xlink:href="dpjo-19-01-0123-g06"/>
        </fig>
        <p>In this case, the surgeon and the orthodontist should have noticed that the patient did
not have a full perception of having a mild facial deformity and, for this reason, he
did not feel negative impact on his quality of life. Thus, the most appropriate
treatment option would be an orthodontic camouflage with the aid of skeletal anchorage.
Such protocol could have prevented the orthosurgical treatment from worsening the
patient's quality of life.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Case report 3</title>
        <p>Black male, 32-year-old patient sought treatment complaining about his dentofacial
esthetics. He was eager to begin orthosurgical treatment. As shown in his initial
records (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f07">Fig 7</xref>), he presented Class III
malocclusion, with severe skeletal discrepancy, maxillary deficiency, mandibular
excess and history of extraction of many teeth.</p>
        <fig id="f07" orientation="portrait" position="float">
          <label>Figure 7</label>
          <caption>

          </caption>
          <graphic xlink:href="dpjo-19-01-0123-g07"/>
        </fig>
        <p>His oral health-related quality of life was assessed. He scored 59 points in the
B-OQLQ and 26 points in the OHIP-14, which suggested a considerably negative impact
on his oral health-related quality of life, corresponding to the severity of his
dentofacial deformity. Due to the great need for orthodontic movement in his case,
the conventional orthosurgical treatment protocol was chosen.</p>
        <p>His B-OQLQ scores were assessed at different periods of orthodontic preparation, a
phase the patient is still going through. After one month of orthodontic preparation,
an initial reduction in the negative impact on patient's quality of life was
observed, with a score of 43 points. Six months after preparation, the patient scored
51 points, suggesting that his condition became slightly worse. After one year of
orthodontic preparation, he scored 63 points, an even more negative impact than his
initial condition. The patient has been going through orthodontic preparation for two
years now (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f08">Fig 8</xref>) and scores 77 points in OQLQ,
thus demonstrating that the longer this treatment phase lasts, the more the patient's
quality of life becomes worse due to postponing the benefits produced by esthetic and
functional alterations.</p>

          <graphic xlink:href="dpjo-19-01-0123-g08"/>
        </fig>
        <p>These data suggest that there should be a preference for orthosurgical treatment
protocols with a substantially reduced preparation phase, such as the anticipated
benefit protocol, for patients to feel less negative impact on their quality of
life.</p>

      <title>FINAL CONSIDERATIONS</title>
      <p>The current objective of orthodontic treatment associated with orthognathic surgery
consists not only in treating the esthetic functional components of dentofacial
deformities, but also in considering patients' psychological factor. Both are parallelly
influenced; but patients' motivations, perceptions and expectations play a significant
role in obtaining successful surgical and psychological results.<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> All these factors influence patients'
quality of life. The latter must be assessed by means of previously validated
questionnaires, such as the B-OQLQ, before treatment onset, so as to determine the
condition's level of influence on patient's quality of life and how such condition can
be improved in order to ensure patients' satisfaction, reestablishing his health as a
whole and, thus, justifying the biological/financial costs the patient had in both
public and private instances.</p>
