          <title>Background</title>
          <p><italic>SOX11</italic> is a transcription factor proposed to play a role in brain development. The relevance of <italic>SOX11</italic> to human developmental disorders was suggested by a recent report of <italic>SOX11</italic> mutations in two patients with Coffin&#x2013;Siris syndrome. Here we further investigate the role of <italic>SOX11</italic> variants in neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>We used array based comparative genomic hybridisation and trio exome sequencing to identify children with intellectual disability who have deletions or de novo point mutations disrupting <italic>SOX11</italic>. The pathogenicity of the <italic>SOX11</italic> mutations was assessed using an in vitro <italic>gene</italic> expression reporter system. Loss-of-function experiments were performed in xenopus by knockdown of Sox11 expression.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>We identified seven individuals with chromosome 2p25 deletions involving <italic>SOX11.</italic> Trio exome sequencing identified three de novo <italic>SOX11</italic> variants, two missense (p.K50N; p.P120H) and one nonsense (p.C29*). The biological consequences of the missense mutations were assessed using an in vitro gene expression system. These individuals had microcephaly, developmental delay and shared dysmorphic features compatible with mild Coffin&#x2013;Siris syndrome. To further investigate the function of <italic>SOX11</italic>, we knocked down the orthologous gene in xenopus. Morphants had significant reduction in head size compared with controls. This suggests that <italic>SOX11</italic> loss of function can be associated with microcephaly.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>We thus propose that <italic>SOX11</italic> deletion or mutation can present with a Coffin&#x2013;Siris phenotype.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The SOX proteins are transcription factors with a shared motif called the SRY box, a high mobility group (HMG) DNA binding domain. The SOX proteins regulate gene expression, acting as either transcriptional activators or repressors, in multiple tissues, and so play crucial roles in multiple developmental processes.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<italic>SOX11</italic> is thought to play a crucial role in brain development. In humans, neuron production begins on embryonic day 42.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In the fetus, the neuronal progenitors are located in the subventricular zone. After production in the subventricular zone, neurons migrate outwards into the cortical layers and undergo differentiation into mature neurons. The linked processes of neuronal production from progenitor cells and differentiation into functioning neurons must be tightly regulated to ensure proper brain development.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<italic>SOX11</italic> null mice have reduced cortical neurogenesis secondary to reduced proliferation and abnormal differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This results in <italic>SOX11</italic> null mice having reduced brain weights and thin cerebral cortices.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> There is also evidence that <italic>SOX11</italic> plays a role in ocular development. <italic>Sox11</italic> knockdown in zebrafish induces microphthalmia with or without iris coloboma.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<italic>SOX11</italic> represents a strong candidate gene for human neurodevelopmental disease.</p>
      <p>Haploinsufficiency of other <italic>SOX</italic> genes is associated with human disease. Mutations in <italic>SOX10</italic> are associated with Waardenburg&#x2013;Hirschprung disease,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<italic>SOX9</italic> mutations with campomelic dysplasia<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and haploinsufficiency of <italic>SOX5</italic> is reported to cause intellectual disability.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Tsurusaki <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> reported two children with Coffin&#x2013;Siris syndrome (CSS, OMIM#135900) and de novo mutations in <italic>SOX11.</italic> CSS is characterised by developmental delay/intellectual disability, feeding difficulties, facial dysmorphology, microcephaly and hypoplastic nails of the fifth digits.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Both of the mutations reported by Tsurusaki <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> were within the HMG domain and interfered with the ability of <italic>SOX11</italic> to induce gene transcription in vitro. This implicates regulation of gene expression as a mechanism by which <italic>SOX11</italic> contributes to human brain development. Multiple genes regulated at a transcriptional level by <italic>SOX11</italic> have been identified.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<italic>SOX11</italic> can also repress transcription of genes important for neurodevelopment. In <italic>SOX11</italic> null mice, <italic>LIS1</italic> was upregulated significantly.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Altered levels of <italic>SOX11</italic> thus have the potential to cause dysregulation of multiple genetic pathways, with clear potential to disrupt developmental processes.</p>
      <p>Here we report seven individuals with chromosome 2p25 deletions including <italic>SOX11</italic> and three with de novo <italic>SOX11</italic> mutations. These individuals presented with a phenotype that had some clinical features of CSS, but not a classical phenotype that would readily permit clinical diagnosis of CSS. An in silico analysis demonstrated that expression of <italic>SOX11</italic> is highest in the brain during early fetal life, suggesting a role for <italic>SOX11</italic> in human neurodevelopment. Knockdown of Sox11 in xenopus laevis was associated with microcephaly in the morphants.</p>

        <p>Individuals with deletion of chromosome 2p25.2, which included the <italic>SOX11</italic> gene, were identified through the DECIPHER collaboration. Deletions were confirmed by FISH.

        <p>The <italic>SOX11</italic> open-reading frame clone was purchased from Promega (Tokyo, Japan) and <italic>SOX11</italic> mutants (c. 150G&gt;C; p. Lys50Asn and c.359C&gt;A; p. Pro120His) generated by site-directed mutagenesis with the KOD-Plus-Mutagenesis Kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Wildtype (WT) and mutant <italic>SOX11</italic> cDNAs were PCR amplified and cloned into the p3xFLAG-CMV-14 mammalian expression vector (Sigma, St Louis, Missouri, USA). The <italic>GDF5</italic> promoter 5&#x2032;-flanking sequence (&#x2212;448/+319) was PCR amplified and cloned into the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). All constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing. Human <italic>SOX11</italic> cDNA can be obtained from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ nucleotide core database under the accession code AB028641.1. Transfection and luciferase reporter assays were performed as previously described.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>

Case 1 is a 12-year-old girl, the first child of healthy non-consanguineous parents (previously described at 7&#x2005;years old<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). She was born at 41&#x2005;weeks of gestation by caesarean section due to fetal bradycardia and oligohydramnios. Birth weight was 3685&#x2005;g (50th centile), length 50&#x2005;cm (50th centile) and birth head circumference 35&#x2005;cm (50th centile). At the age of 12&#x2005;years, her head circumference was 50.4&#x2005;cm (&lt;3rd centile), height 152&#x2005;cm (25&#x2013;50th) and weight 44&#x2005;kg (75th centile). She walked without support at 18&#x2005;months and has poor fine motor skills. She started speaking single words at the age of 3&#x2005;years and 6&#x2005;months and has had no further language development. She manifests repetitive and stereotyped movements with hyperactivity and autism. She had a non-verbal IQ of 54. She was generally well apart from gastro-oesophageal reflux. On examination she has mild facial asymmetry with right microphthalmia and a wide mouth with thick lips and large, simplified ears. Bilateral fifth finger clinodactyly, cutaneous syndactyly of toes 2&#x2013;3, scoliosis and inverted nipples were also noted. CGH was reported as arr 2p25(4291420&#x2013;6905655)(hg 19)x1 with deletion of the <italic>SOX11</italic> gene only. The deletion was not present in either parent.</p>

Birth weight was 3118&#x2005;g (26th centile). There was poor feeding in the neonatal period requiring nasogastric feeding. She had global developmental delay; first walking at 2&#x2005;years and 6&#x2005;months old. She has never spoken. At the age of 12&#x2005;years and 6&#x2005;months, her height was 89.4&#x2005;cm (&lt;0.4th), weight 12.15&#x2005;kg (&lt;0.4th) and head circumference 46.5&#x2005;cm (&lt;0.4th). She has profound intellectual disability, severe autism, absence seizures, bruxism and a tendency to pick at her skin. On examination facial dysmorphism (sunken eyes, depressed nasomaxillary area and wide mouth with thick lips), bilateral fifth finger clinodactyly and hypoplasia of the toe nails of her little toes were noted. She had oculomotor apraxia. Brain MRI was normal. CGH was normal. Exome sequencing identified a de novo, heterozygous missense variant in SOX11 (c.359C&gt;A, p. Pro120His; NM_003108.3).</p>
        <p>Case 9 is an 11-year-old boy, the first child of healthy non-consanguineous parents. Pregnancy was complicated by third trimester bleeding. He was born at 40&#x2005;weeks of gestation. Birth weight was 3500&#x2005;g (50th). He was readmitted to hospital at 3&#x2005;weeks of age with poor feeding (immature suck, choking and regurgitation of bottle feeds) and failure to thrive. He had global developmental delay; first walking at age 2&#x2005;years and speaking his first words at age 3. At 11&#x2005;years of age, he was described as being aggressive with poor attention and no sense of danger. He spoke only in short sentences and was in a special needs school. On examination he was on the 9th centile for height and weight and had a head circumference under the 0.4<sup>th</sup> centile. He had bilateral conductive deafness, cryptorchidism, hypermetropia and squint. He had malar flattening, a short philtrum and tented upper lip and a left preauricular skin tag. Bilateral 2&#x2013;3 cutaneous toe syndactyly and fifth finger clinodactyly was also noted. CGH was normal. Exome sequencing identified a de novo, missense variant in <italic>SOX11</italic> (c.150G&gt;C, p. Lys50Asn).</p>
        <p>Case 10 is a 6-year-old boy, the child of healthy non-consanguineous parents. He was born by planned caesarean section with a birth weight of 4.08&#x2005;kg (75th). He presented with mild global developmental delay; first walking at 16&#x2005;months of age and having significantly delayed expressive speech. He attends a learning unit and has over-excitable behaviour. He is generally well apart from enuresis. He was 124.5&#x2005;cm tall (75th centile), 29&#x2005;kg (91st centile) and head circumference was 54&#x2005;cm (75th centile). On examination he was noted to have slightly coarse facial features with wide mouth and thick lips, a prominent metopic suture, arched well-defined eyebrows and midline anterior hairline upsweep. He had oculomotor apraxia. Bilateral fifth finger clinodactyly and fifth fingernail hypoplasia was noted along with bilateral fourth/fifth toenail hypoplasia. Radiographs of the hands and feet were normal. A brain MRI detected hypoplasia of the inferior aspect of the cerebellar vermis. Array CGH (180k, Agilent) was normal. Exome sequencing identified a de novo, nonsense variant in <italic>SOX11</italic> (c.87C&gt;A, p. Cys29*).</p>

        <p>The c.150G&gt;C (p. Lys50Asn) variant was predicted by SIFT to be deleterious (score of 0) and PolyPhen to be probably damaging (score of 1). The c.359C&gt;A (p. Pro120His) variant was predicted by SIFT to be deleterious (score of 0) and by PolyPhen to be probably damaging (score of 0.996). Both mutations localise to the HMG (DNA binding) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2015103393F3">figure 3</xref>). The &#x2018;Have Your Protein Explained&#x2019; tool identified that in the c.359C&gt;A (p. Pro120His) variant, the mutant residue (histidine) is larger and more hydrophilic than the WT amino acid. This was predicted to interfere with DNA binding and protein&#x2013;protein interaction. In the c.150G&gt;C (p. Lys50Asn) variant, asparagine is noted to be of smaller size and neutral charge compared with the WT amino acid. This was also predicted to interfere with DNA binding. Both variants are found at evolutionary conserved amino acids. Neither variant was found in the exAC database, nor was the c.87C&gt;A, p. Cys29* mutation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we report seven patients with chromosome 2p25 deletions, which include <italic>SOX11,</italic> and three individuals with de novo <italic>SOX11</italic> point mutations. The individuals with deletions had several phenotypic features in common (<xref ref-type="table" rid="JMEDGENET2015103393TB1">table 1</xref>). Microcephaly was reported in all but two. All had developmental delay, with particularly marked speech delay. A shared facial dysmorphology of wide mouth and thick lips could be discerned. One of the patients reported here had trigonocephaly, and so it is interesting to note that a 2004 report describes a boy with trigonocephaly, cleft palate and multiple minor anomalies with deletion of <italic>SOX11</italic> resulting from an unbalanced translocation 46,XY,t(2;17)(p25;q24).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Fifth finger clinodactyly and cutaneous syndactyly of toes 2&#x2013;3 was a frequent examination finding. There was considerable variability between deletion cases&#x2014;likely reflecting the different CNV sizes. The individuals with de novo <italic>SOX11</italic> mutations had several shared phenotypic features. Microcephaly, low birth weight and neonatal feeding difficulties associated with hypotonia were frequent findings. Developmental delay was reported in all cases apart from patient 2 in Tsurusaki <italic>et al</italic>'s<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> report. Hypoplasia of the distal phalanx of the fifth finger, broad halluces, 2&#x2013;3 toe syndactyly and hypoplasia of the nail of the fifth toe are also frequent. Ocular abnormalities were present in both deletion and mutation cases; case 1 had right microphthalmia, cases 2, 4 and 7 had hypermetropia and squint while cases 7 and 9 had oculomotor apraxia. Our report confirms that <italic>SOX11</italic> mutations and deletions can be associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder, which manifests features of CSS.</p>
      <p>The clinical features associated with <italic>SOX11</italic> deletion or mutation overlap with other syndromes. Hypoplasia of the fifth fingers with dysmorphism and intellectual disability can be observed in mosaic trisomy 9,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> deafness-onychodystrophy&#x2013;osteodystrophy&#x2013;mental retardation syndrome<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and phenytoin embryopathy.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> There is overlap between mild forms of Cornelia de Lange syndrome and individuals with <italic>SOX11</italic> mutations.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> It is important to note that none of our cohort had a clinical diagnosis of CSS prior to CGH or exome sequencing being performed. In retrospect, the individuals we report had clinical features compatible with CSS (eg, hypoplasia of fifth finger) but did not present with classical dysmorphic features of CSS, which would enable a clinical diagnosis to be readily made. This is analogous to the presentation of <italic>ARID1B</italic> mutations. <italic>ARID1B</italic> mutations have been identified as the most common cause of CSS and also in children with intellectual disability who have subtle features of CSS, but who would not have been diagnosed with this syndrome on the basis of their phenotype alone.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> However, we suggest that certain features of CSS, such as the pattern of hair distribution (synophrys, sparse scalp hair but increased body hair) and fifth finger hypoplasia in combination, should lead to CSS being included in differential diagnoses for children with a neurodevelopmental disorder.</p>
      <p>Several other genes within the deleted 2p25 regions could contribute to the observed phenotypes. In the centromeric deletions (cases 2 and 4), it is highly likely that <italic>MYCN</italic> deletion contributes to the phenotype. Deletions and mutations of <italic>MYCN</italic> are associated with Feingold syndrome.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The classical features of Feingold syndrome are microcephaly, intestinal atresias and brachymesophalangy of the second and fifth fingers. The severe intellectual disability reported in case 4 is unusual for individuals with Feingold syndrome.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In the individual with a telomeric deletion (case 5), loss of <italic>MYTL1</italic> is likely to contribute to the phenotype. However, case 5 has borderline microcephaly, while the other individuals in the report of De Rocker <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> who had similar deletions involving <italic>MYT1L</italic> but not <italic>SOX11</italic> tended to have macrocephaly. This suggests that <italic>SOX11</italic> haploinsufficiency may exert a powerful, negative influence on brain growth. Cases 1 and 7 have no genes other than <italic>SOX11</italic> in the deleted region, while the deletion in cases 3 and 6 also contains the <italic>CMPK2</italic>, <italic>RSAD2</italic> and <italic>RNF144A</italic> genes. <italic>CMPK2</italic> encodes a mitochondrial nucleoside monophosphate kinase,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<italic>RSAD2</italic> encodes viperin, which is an antiviral protein,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and <italic>RNF144A</italic> is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in DNA damage repair and apotosis.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Haploinsufficiency scores indicate that heterozygous loss of these genes is unlikely to cause a neurodevelopmental disorder. This provides evidence that <italic>SOX11</italic> deletion alone can be associated with a neurodevelopmental phenotype.</p>
      <p>The fact that both heterozygous deletions and mutations of <italic>SOX11</italic> are associated with microcephaly suggests that loss of function and haploinsufficiency may be the underlying mechanism. The two missense variants we describe are within the HMG DNA binding domain (as were the two previously reported missense variants<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) while the c.87 C&gt;A variant would be predicted to lead to premature termination of translation prior to this domain. <italic>SOX11</italic> is a single exon gene. Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) may not occur with mutations in the final exon of a gene,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> so it is possible that a mutant <italic>SOX11</italic> transcript may not undergo NMD. However, the c.87C&gt;A mutation occurs before the HMG domain in <italic>SOX11</italic>, so it is likely that any protein product will be unable to bind DNA and induce gene expression. The mutant protein is also likely to be unstable given its truncated nature. It is thus likely that all three mutations will interfere with the ability of <italic>SOX11</italic> to regulate its target genes. Our luciferase reporter gene assays provide further evidence in support of this as they indicate a reduced ability of mutant <italic>SOX11</italic> to induce gene expression. An in vitro study of <italic>SOX11</italic> overexpressing cells identified multiple genes upregulated by <italic>SOX11</italic>, which are relevant to neurogenesis and brain development.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> We hypothesise that haploinsufficiency of <italic>SOX11</italic> could potentially reduce expression of these target genes at critical points in brain development, resulting in a neurodevelopmental disorder.</p>
      <p>The expression pattern of <italic>SOX11</italic> in the human brain is in keeping with the gene playing a role in neurogenesis during embryonic development. We show that <italic>SOX11</italic> expression peaks in the first three&#x2005;months of in utero life and declines thereafter. Since neurogenesis in the fetal brain is largely completed by mid-gestation,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> this temporal expression pattern fits with <italic>SOX11</italic> being involved in neurogenesis in the fetal brain. The spatial expression pattern of <italic>SOX11</italic> in fetal brain also suggests that <italic>SOX11</italic> is involved in neurogenesis since <italic>SOX11</italic> expression was significantly higher in the ventricular zone than in areas with relatively low levels of neurogenesis. That two of our cases had brain malformations provides further evidence that <italic>SOX11</italic> functions in human neurodevelopment.</p>
      <p>Data from animal models also suggests that <italic>SOX11</italic> plays an important role in eye development since <italic>SOX11</italic> knockdown in zebrafish can cause ocular malformations.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In addition, variants in <italic>SOX11</italic> have also been identified in two individuals with iris coloboma and no neurodevelopmental phenotype.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This may be explained by the fact that the sequence variants in these individuals were not located in the DNA binding HMG domain of SOX11 protein, while variants reported herein associated with CSS were predicted to interfere with DNA binding.</p>
      <p>Our experiments in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos indicate that loss of Sox11 is associated with microcephaly. We previously demonstrated that Sox11 depletion leads to smaller eyes.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> This is in line with our current study as case 1 shows microphthalmia. Moreover, the microophthalmia phenotype can be rescued by co-injection of WT Sox11 RNA.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The fact that (1) Sox11 depletion leads to an eye phenotype<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> similar to case 1 (our current study), (2) co-injection of Sox11 MO together with WT Sox11 RNA results in a rescue of the Sox11 MO-induced eye phenotype<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and (3) Sox11 MO injection does not lead to an increased death rate compared with control MO injection suggests that the microcephaly phenotype of Sox11 knockdown in <italic>X. laevis</italic> is not explained by non-specific toxic effects of MO injection. The precise mechanism by which loss of Sox11 results in microcephaly in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, however, is still unclear. Our previous work on <italic>Xenopus</italic> eye development indicates that Sox11 knockdown does not alter proliferation but is associated with increased neuronal apoptosis.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> This suggests that <italic>SOX11</italic> may also function as a neuronal survival factor in brain development.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we describe a series of individuals with <italic>SOX11</italic> deletions or de novo mutations presenting a neurodevelopmental disorder, which had clinical features compatible with CSS. The two <italic>SOX11</italic> missense variants reported here are the only plausibly pathogenic <italic>SOX11</italic> variants identified from over 1000 exomes performed on probands with a developmental disorder in the DDD study.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<italic>SOX11</italic> variants are a rare cause of neurodevelopmental disorders. That both deletions and mutations of <italic>SOX11</italic> can cause CSS is in keeping with data reported for <italic>ARID1A</italic> and <italic>ARID1B,</italic> deletions or truncating mutations of which also cause CSS.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Deletion mapping, in our small cohort, suggests that <italic>SOX11</italic> deletion, although likely pathogenic in itself, can also act as part of a contiguous gene deletion along with loss of <italic>MYT1L</italic> or <italic>MYCN</italic>. The mechanism is likely to be <italic>SOX11</italic> haploinsufficiency with dysregulation of the <italic>SOX11</italic> target genes and consequent disruption of brain development. <italic>SOX11</italic> is itself induced by the BAF (BRG1-associated or HRBM-associated factors) complex, leading to neuronal differentiation.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> It is noteworthy that many other genes mutated in CSS function in the BAF complex.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The majority of genes in the BAF complex in which mutations have been identified are associated with a CSS phenotype (eg, ARID1A, ARID1B, SMARCB1, SMARCA4 and SMARCE1), while mutations in SMARCA2 cause Nicolaides&#x2013;Baraitser syndrome.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Our report thus reinforces the importance of the BAF complex in CSS. In conclusion, the current study provides evidence that <italic>SOX11</italic> is a further member of the SOX protein family associated with human neurodevelopmental disease.</p>
