          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Lichtheimia corymbifera (previously Absidia corymbifera) is a filamentous zygomycetes belonging to the order Mucorales and to the family Lichtheimiaceae. Members of genus Lichtheimia spp. are cosmopolitan and ubiquitous in nature. Lichtheimia corymbifera is a recognized agent of diseases in man and animals. In cattle it causes abortion and mastitis. Three cases of bovine abortion occurred in a herd located in the Po Valley. Serological examinations were performed on fetal and mother's blood. One of the aborted fetus was referred to our laboratory. The paper describes the isolation and characterization of Lichtheimia corymbifera from a bovine aborted fetus.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Serological examinations were performed on fetal and mother's blood. Lesions on fetal tissues and placenta leaded the diagnostic suspect towards a mycotic aetiology. Tissues were then put in culture, and at the same time an histological examination was performed, together with bacteriological and virological tests. The isolate from placenta and fetal tissues was identified and characterized by PCR and RFLP, using the ITS region as a target sequence and AclI restriction site within the amplicon to distinguish Lichtheimia corymbifera among the other fungi.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Serological, bacteriological and virological tests gave aspecific results. Histological examination evidenced numerous PAS positive hyphae within the necrotic cotiledons and numerous fungal nonseptate hyphae to the GMS stain. Colonies with typical morphological features of fungi grew up on Sabouraud agar from fetal skin and placenta. On the developed colonies the microscopic examination has shown a large number of nonseptate hyphae and sporangia consistent with Mucorales. PCR and RFLP allowed the identification of the isolate as Lichtheimia corymbifera.</p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>The present report describes the isolation and the molecular characterisation of a fungal isolate from bovine aborted fetus and placenta. The diagnostic protocol allowed to identify and characterise the strain. This is the first isolation in Italy of Lichtheimia corymbifera in a bovine aborted fetus.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Bovine abortion is defined as an interruption of pregnancy between the 42<sup>nd </sup>and 260<sup>th </sup>day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Among the infectious causes of abortion in cattle are included bacteriological, viral, parasitic and mycotic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The knowledge of fungi as abortive pathogens is dated from the last century, and mycotic placentitis is a cause of abortion in cattle worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>In the northern hemisphere the incidence of mycotic abortion is sporadic, occurring mainly during the winter periods (November - April), when the cows are usually fed with a large amount of hay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This phenomenon is more evident in conditions of poor aeration and high humidity, which promotes the environmental growth of fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The administration of wet stored and mouldy fodder, in which a large amount of fungal spores could be present, is a further risk factor for the mycotic abortion. The fungal spores can penetrate through gastric lesions or the respiratory tract and reach the placenta and the fetus where there are optimal conditions for their full development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The mycotic abortion in cattle usually occurs at the 6<sup>th </sup>- 8<sup>th </sup>months of gestation and is often followed by placenta retention. The placenta is thickened and wooden in appearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and haemorrhagic necrotizing placentitis, often associated with thickened yellowish necrotic cotyledons may be present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. On the fetus skin lesions similar to parakeratotic dermatitis are usually evident, characterized by raised ringworm-like fungal skin plaques and blefaritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>Different fungi have been isolated from aborted fetuses, belonging to the species <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus </italic>and <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic>, <italic>Absidia corymbifera</italic>, <italic>Mortierella wolfii</italic>, <italic>Rhizopus </italic>spp., <italic>Mucor </italic>spp., and <italic>Rhizomucor </italic>spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Previous reports recorded that &gt; 60% of cases of abortion in the USA were caused by uncomplicated infection with <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>. Zygomycetes (<italic>Absidia, Mortierella, Rhizomucor, Rhizopus</italic>) accounted for about 20% of cases, and the remaining 20% were caused by a wide range of opportunistic filamentous fungi and yeasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In Australia <italic>Aspergillus </italic>spp. and <italic>Mortierella wolfii </italic>have been isolated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and in New Zealand <italic>Mortierella wolfii </italic>has been considered the major mycotic cause of abortion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In Europe, there are reports of mycotic abortion in Great Britain due to <italic>Aspergillus, Mortierella </italic>and <italic>Absidia </italic>spp. since 1967 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and more recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In Italy only cases of mycotic abortion due to <italic>Aspergillus </italic>spp. are reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p>
      <p>In February 2009 three cases of abortion occurred during a single week in a Friesian dairy herd located in the province of Parma (Po Valley), area of production of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. The herd size was 120 animals (60 lactating), free-stall housing, not vaccinated for infectious abortive agents. The abortions occurred between the 5<sup>th </sup>and the 6<sup>th </sup>month of gestation, without apparent symptoms. Signs of illness were not observed in the dams before and after abortions. Of the three aborted fetuses, only one showed skin lesions. It was aborted at the 23<sup>rd </sup>week of pregnancy and referred to our laboratory for diagnostic investigations. Aim of the work is to describe the isolation and characterisation of a strain of <italic>Lichtheimia corymbifera </italic>isolated from the referred fetus, to provide a complete diagnostic protocol in case of bovine mycotic abortion.</p>

        <title>Histological examinations</title>
        <p>Histological examinations were performed on fetal tissue samples including skin, heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, fetal stomach and placenta collected during the necropsy and fixed in 4% buffered formalin (Bio-Optica). The samples were routinely processed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) for histopathological evaluation. To investigate the presence of fungi, periodic acid Schiff reaction (PAS) and Grocott's Methenamine Silver stain (GMS) were also performed on tissue sections.</p>

        <title>Culture</title>
        <p>Bacteriological examination was performed on fetal spleen, liver, kidney, lung, heart, skin, stomach content and placenta on blood agar (5% bovine erythrocytes) and Mc Conkey agar (DIFCO) and incubated for 24-48 hours at 37&#xB0;C in air. The fetal stomach content was specifically cultured for the isolation of <italic>Brucella </italic>spp. on 5% blood agar and incubated in microaerophilic (5% CO<sub>2</sub>) environment.</p>
        <p>Mycological culture was performed on fetal spleen, liver, kidney, lung, heart and placenta on Sabouraud agar (DIFCO), and incubated for 24-48 hours at 37&#xB0;C in air.</p>

        <title>Determination of melezitose assimilation</title>
        <p>Melezitose assimilation was performed using ID32C strip (bioM&#xE9;rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) as reported by Schwarz and coll. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Serological examinations</title>
        <p>Serological examinations for the main infectious abortive agents were performed on blood sera from aborted cows. Moreover, during the necropsy of the fetus, 1 ml of blood from the atrial chambers of the heart was taken. The serological examination of the blood samples to investigate the presence of antibodies against abortive agents was performed for <italic>Brucella abortus </italic>by card test agglutination (Brucelloslide Test, bioM&#xE9;rieux), <italic>Neospora caninum </italic>by indirect immunofluorescence, <italic>Chlamydophila abortus </italic>by ELISA (Civtest Bovis Chlamydia ps., Hipra), Bovine Viral Diarrea (BVD) virus by seroneutralization, <italic>Coxiella burnetii </italic>by ELISA (Chekit Q Fever antibody ELISA test kit, IDEXX), and <italic>Leptospira </italic>serovar <italic>sejroe-hardjo</italic>, <italic>australis-bratislava</italic>, <italic>pomona-pomona</italic>, <italic>icterohaemorrhagiae-copenhageni </italic>by microagglutination test. ELISAs were performed following manufacturer instructions. Seroneutralization, indirect immunofluorescence and microagglutination test were performed following our in-house protocols.</p>

        <title>Virological examination</title>
        <p>Virological examination was performed on fetal spleen and lung tissues by direct ELISA (ELISA BVD/MD antigen mix screening, Pourquier) following manufacturer instructions to assess the presence of BVD virus.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Molecular identification and characterization</title>
        <p>Molecular identification and characterization was performed on isolated fungal mycelia. Genomic DNA extraction, PCR and RFLP were performed as described by Machouart and coll. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Specific sense primers for <italic>Rhizopus </italic>spp., <italic>Rhizomucor </italic>spp., <italic>Mucor </italic>spp., and <italic>Lichtheimia corymbifera </italic>(RpL1, 5' TGATCTACGTGACAAATTCT 3'; RmL1, 5' TGATCTACGCGAGCGAACAA 3'; MucL1, 5' TGATCTACGTGACATATTCT 3'; and AbsL1, 5' TGATCTACACGGCATCAAAT 3', respectively) were used with a degenerate antisense primer (MR1, 5' AGTAGTTTGTCTTCGGKCAA 3'). The region selected for the design of primers excluded the amplification of human DNA and other filamentous fungi. Primers Lap (5' GAAACTGCGAATGGCTCATTA 3') and Rap (5' CAATCCAAGAATTTCACCTCT 3') designed to amplify all the fungi and the human DNA were used as positive controls.</p>
        <p>The amplicon was also sub-cloned into the 2886 bp pTZ57R/T vector (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, USA) and subjected to RFLP analysis with AclI restriction enzyme.</p>

        <title>Isolation of fungi</title>
        <p>Non-haemolytic, non-pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>has grown up from liver, spleen, kidney, heart and lung. After 6 days, these plates were still negative for <italic>Brucella </italic>spp. growth. Colonies with typical morphological features of fungi grew up on Sabouraud agar after 24 hours of aerobic incubation from fetal skin and placenta. Colonies were fast growing, white at first becoming pale grey with age, and up to 1.5 cm high (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), woolly to cottony in aspect. The reverse side was uncoloured and without pigment production. On the colonies a direct microscopic examination with Cotton Blue staining showed a large number of nonseptate hyphae, with a diameter of 6 to 15 &#x3BC;m. Specialised hyphae sporangiophores, hyaline or faintly pigmented in colour and simple or branched, arised in groups of three at the internodes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Sporangiophores showed relatively small sporangia (20-120 &#x3BC;m of diameter), typically pyriform in shape with characteristic conical-shaped columella and pronounced apophysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), often with a short projection at the top, morphologically consistent with <italic>Lichtheimia corymbifera </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Sporangiospores were ellipsoid, light grey coloured and smooth-walled (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). They were detected in the sporangium and released to the surrounding area. The presence of rhizoids was not observed. Moreover, the isolate was not capable to utilize melezitose as sole carbon source.</p>

AclI digestion generated 2 restriction fragments of 518 and 306 bp for the 824 bp PCR amplicon and 3 fragments of 1846, 1481 and 373 bp for the subcloned 824 bp amplicon. In both cases the restriction pattern corresponds to <italic>Lichtheimia corymbifera </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Sequencing of the 824 bp cloned fragment further confirmed the specificity of the amplicon and the absence of hypothetical polymorphisms or mutations.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the area where the abortions occurred, the nutrition of dairy cattle is regulated by strict rules and the administration of silage is forbidden. Consequently, dairy cows are fed with a major amount of hay. In our case, heifers were usually fed with grass and hay, while during the pregnancy the ration was supplemented with hay stored the year before in a moist place, exposed to bad weather conditions. The risk factors associated to the administration of mouldy hay were present. Moreover, the macroscopic lesions on the fetus and placenta were consistent with mycotic abortion, confirmed by cultural and histological findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The morphological aspect of the colonies on Sabouraud agar, the microscopic aspect of the hyphae, sporangia and sporangiospores and the execution of the PCR and RFLP directed the diagnosis to <italic>Lichtheimia corymbifera </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The isolation of non-pathogenic <italic>E. coli </italic>from fetal tissues, associated to the absence of gross lesions in the fetal organs, and the BVDV seropositivity at low titre of the dam have to be considered not meaningful to demonstrate the involvement of these pathogens in the abortive event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition, necrotizing placentitis is rarely associated to BVDV, and in our case BVD virus was not detected by direct diagnostic procedures on fetal spleen and lungs.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Our findings support the conclusion that <italic>Lichtheimia corymbifera </italic>is the causative agent of the abortion. The present case is particularly relevant because represents the first isolation in Italy of <italic>Lichtheimia corymbifera </italic>in a bovine aborted fetus. It is useful to stress that in case of abortion the routine diagnostic procedures should include the mycotic component and assess the fungal species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In accordance to the assumption that mycotic abortion is characterised by the presence of mycotic elements associated with placentitis and fetal dermatitis, and that morphologic characteristics of hyphae in tissues have to be compatible with cultured isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], confirmation lies in the isolation and identification of the specific mycotic agent. In our case, identification has been confirmed by PCR, and the characterization of the isolate has been made by RFLP. This diagnostic procedure allowed to establish without doubt the etiology of abortion.</p>
