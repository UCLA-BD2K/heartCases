      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Scrub typhus is caused by <italic>Orientia tsutsugamushi</italic>. Scrub typhus is endemic in many Asian countries, including China, India, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and others regions in East and South East Asia.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> A delay in the diagnosis and treatment can result in severe complications, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
      <p>HLH is a rare but potentially fatal disease, characterized by a malfunction of natural killer T-cell function, activation and proliferation of lymphocytes or histiocytes with uncontrolled hemophagocytosis and cytokine overproduction.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> HLH phenotypically presents as 2 different conditions: primary (PHLH) and secondary (SHLH). SHLH has been associated with a variety of stimuli, such as infections, malignant neoplasia, and conditions characterized by immunosuprresion.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The SHLH associated with scrub typhus has been reported only in 4 cases (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Here, we report 3 additional cases from the Southern part of China.</p>

        <p>A 6-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital in the context of fever of unknown origin for 7 days (August, 2009). Before admission, the boy was treated for 5 days with ceftriaxone for the presumptive diagnosis of sepsis. This boy lived in Cang-nan County, which is a rural area in South of China where scrub typhus is considered endemic. On examination, a temperature of 39.7&#xB0;C was measured and a 1 &#xD7; 0.5&#x200A;cm necrotic cutaneous lesion was observed on the left shoulder (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). Ultrasound examination revealed splenomegaly extending 4.0&#x200A;cm below the left costal margin at the lowest point.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Scrub typhus is a common cause of acute febrile illness. As pathognomonic feature, the finding of a cutaneous lesion is essential for the diagnosis of this disease. However, it is sometimes difficult to be noticed at early stages because the lesion could appear at any (hidden) location (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This is also the most important reason for a delayed diagnosis.</p>
      <fig id="F2" position="float">

        <graphic xlink:href="medi-95-e2928-g004"/>
      </fig>
      <p>All our patients presented with fever and a pathognomonic lesion. A high anti-Proteus OX-K titer as observed by the Weil&#x2013;Felix slide agglutination test was noticed.</p>
      <p>All 3 cases presented with 5 out of 8 diagnostic HLH-2004 criteria (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In our patients, a clear association was found between scrub typhus and HLH as demonstrated by the diagnosis of scrub typhus and the complete resolution of the hemophagocytic condition after successful treatment with chloramphenicol.</p>
      <p>Only a minimal amount of evidence based on epidemiologic data can be found related to SHLH cases with 20% of the cases initiated in relation to an infection.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Scrub typhus-associated HLH is even more rare, Cascio et al reviewed 153 papers on SHLH in zoonoses between 1950 and 2012, and only 4 papers were associated with <italic>tsutsugamushi</italic>.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The mortality rate of HLH as presented in the literature, ranged from 22% to 60%.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Early diagnosis and treatment could improve the outcomes of HLH in children.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The HLH-2004 guidelines are suitable for all patients with HLH, with or without evidence of genetic or familial disease, regardless of documented or suspected viral infections.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Dexamethasone, etoposide, and cyclosporin A are recommended as the initial therapy in this protocol. Kleynberg and Schiller et al emphasized the importance of etoposide for the treatment of EBV infection associated with HLH.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> According to the reported papers,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> 2 cases (age 5 years, 2 months, respectively) were treated with doxycycline<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and 1 case (age 9 years) was treated with doxycycline plus chloramphenicol with chemotherapy including etoposide, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, and methotrexate.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> All these patients survived. It seems effective to treat the scrub typhus-associated HLH in children by doxycycline with or without chemotherapy. However, 1 member of the tetracycline family, doxycycline, is banned for use in children under the age of 8 years in China (negative impact on bone growth and discoloration of permanent teeth). In addition, another case (age 8 months) treated by clarithromycin in association with etoposide resulted incomplete remission.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> However, in case 2, 3-day azithromycin was administered before hospital admission and another case was treated with empiric roxithromycin for 7 days before doxycycline plus chloramphenicol was given.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The 2 patients continued to have daily fevers. The effective use of macrolides for scrub typhus-associated HLH in children is questionable.</p>
      <p>Our 3 cases were treated with chloramphenicol without chemotherapy, resulting in complete resolution of the disease. Another 2 cases were found to be treated with doxycycline without chemotherapy also resulting in complete resolution.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Considering the severe toxic and side effect to children, the use of chemotherapy (e.g., etoposide) in the treatment of scrub typhus-associated HLH in children may be unnecessary. The main side effects of chloramphenicol treatment are aplastic anaemia and bone marrow suppression. The former is very rare<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and the latter is fully reversible once the drug is stopped. All our patients had blood counts checked twice weekly during treatment and once monthly after discharge until 1 year. No aplastic anaemia or bone marrow suppression was noticed. In the children under the age of 8 years, chloramphenicol may be the most desirable drug in the treatment of scrub typhus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome.</p>
      <p>Six of the 7 known cases with confirmed diagnosis in &lt;10 days achieved complete resolution. Only 1 case resulted in permanent neurological sequelae but this patient had its diagnosis confirmed only on the 19th day after onset.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Early diagnosis and treatment (e.g. within 10 days of onset) seem to be essential for preventing sequelae to appear based on this data.</p>

      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>In summary, these case reports present the therapy for scrub typhus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome in children. With early diagnosis and treatment within a 10 days period after onset, sequelae seem not to appear. Chloramphenicol without the addition of chemotherapy as the treatment of scrub typhus-associated HLH in children under the age of 8 years may be an appropriate choice. However, large, prospective randomized controlled trials are needed.</p>
