      <abstract>
        <p>Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) usually occurs in patients with severe immunosuppression, hematological malignancies, chronic inflammatory conditions or receiving organ transplant. Recently, PML has also been observed in patients treated with monoclonal antibodies. By taking advantage of the availability of samples from a multiple sclerosis (MS) patient treated with natalizumab, the antibody anti-&#x3B1;4 integrin, who developed PML and was monitored starting before therapy initiation, we investigated the fate of T and B lymphocytes in the onset of PML. Real-time PCR was used to measure new T- and B-cell production by means of T-cell receptor excision circle (TREC) and K-deleting recombination excision circle (KREC) analysis and to quantify transcripts for CD34, terminal-deoxynucleotidyltransferase, and V pre-B lymphocyte gene 1. T- and B-cell subsets and T-cell heterogeneity were measured by flow cytometry and spectratyping. The data were compared to those of untreated and natalizumab-treated MS patients and healthy donors. Before therapy, a patient who developed PML had a low TREC and KREC number; TRECs remained low, while KRECs and pre-B lymphocyte gene 1 transcripts peaked at 6 months of therapy and then decreased at PML diagnosis. Flow cytometry confirmed the deficient number of newly produced T lymphocytes, counterbalanced by an increase in TEMRA cells. The percentage of naive B cells increased by approximately 70% after 6 months of therapy, but B lymphocyte number remained low for the entire treatment period. T-cell heterogeneity and immunoglobulins were reduced.</p>
        <p>Although performed in a single patient, all results showed that an immune deficit, together with an increase in newly produced B cells a few months after therapy initiation, may predispose the patient to PML. These findings indicate the TREC/KREC assay is a potential tool to identify patients at risk of developing PML and may provide insights into the immunological involvement of monoclonal antibody-associated therapies.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare, but often fatal, demyelinating brain disease caused by the JC virus (JCV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Koralnik1">[1]</xref> that usually occurs in patients with severe immunosuppression. Prior to the era of the HIV epidemic, PML arose preferentially in a few immunosuppressed patients, including organ transplant recipients and those with hematological malignancies and chronic inflammatory conditions. Recently, PML has also been observed in patients treated with monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Tan1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Major1">[3]</xref>. MoAb-associated PML is likely the result of a complex combination of several pathogenic mechanisms, including mobilization of JCV-carrying CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cells and pre-B cells, neurotropic JCV transformation, changes in the blood-brain barrier/central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-delPilarMartin1">[4]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Sabath1">[9]</xref>, and alterations in peripheral cell-mediated immunity, with failure of CD4 and CD8 cells and specific anti-JCV antibodies to control JCV-induced PML <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Koralnik2">[10]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Kalams1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The estimated overall risk of PML in natalizumab-treated multiple sclerosis (MS) patients is 1.51 per 1000 patients and this risk might increase beyond 24 months of treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Clifford1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Kappos1">[15]</xref>. The mechanisms leading to natalizumab-induced PML are still incompletely understood; however, because the blocking of the &#x3B1;4 chain of VLA-4 (&#x3B1;4&#x3B2;1) and &#x3B1;4&#x3B2;7 integrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Rice1">[16]</xref> prevents adhesion and diapedesis of activated lymphocytes through the blood-brain barrier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Coisne1">[17]</xref>, this drug might also block the entry of JCV-specific T cells, resulting in decreased nervous system immune surveillance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Stuve1">[18]</xref>. Furthermore, circulating B cells, and especially pre-B cells, are elevated in natalizumab-treated patients, raising the possibility that the therapeutic effects, as well as the side effects, of natalizumab can be mediated, at least in part, by the action of B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Krumbholz1">[19]</xref>. However, a recent study demonstrated that CD34<sup>+</sup> cells are not a relevant reservoir for JCV DNA in patients treated with natalizumab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Warnke1">[20]</xref> and, therefore, alternative sites or mechanisms of brain infection should be considered. Concerning the immune response against JCV, the results are conflicting because there are studies that do not find alterations in the immune response to JCV, whereas others demonstrate a reduced T-cell activity during natalizumab treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Chen1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Jilek1">[22]</xref>. Therefore, the understanding of the biological basis of natalizumab-induced PML development is presently undefined, mostly due to the lack of long-term follow-up studies aimed at analyzing laboratory parameters that may help to recapitulate the onset of the disease and, possibly, to prevent it. We performed the present study with the goal of monitoring the humoral and cellular response before and after natalizumab therapy in a MS patient who developed PML at the 34<sup>th</sup> month of natalizumab therapy (pmlMS). MS patients treated with natalizumab but without PML (nMS), untreated patients (uMS), and healthy donors (HD) were used as controls.</p>

        <title>Patients and sample collection</title>
        <p>We investigated the immune status of six patients with relapsing-remitting MS, who were treated with natalizumab because of frequent relapses during treatments with other immunomodulatory agents (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0034493-t001">Table 1</xref>). After 34 months of therapy, a 42-year-old woman developed PML, which was diagnosed on the basis of clinical presentation, magnetic resonance images, and the presence of 24 copies/mL of JCV (measured at LMMN/NINDS/NIH) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). She did not show clinical signs of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome after drug suspension and plasmapheresis.</p>

        <p>Because only one patient with PML was available, measures of her immune parameters were considered statistically different from those of nMS and uMS patients or HD samples (used as controls) when the values were outside the confidence interval of their respective means. To account for the multiple comparisons involving the same datasets, Bonferroni corrected P-values were employed. In particular, for TRECs and KRECs, the corrected P was 0.01, thus the 99% confidence intervals were calculated (after log transformation of data), while, for flow cytometry data, to account for 15 multiple comparisons, the corrected P-value was 0.0033, and the 99.6% confidence intervals were obtained.

In the other nMS patients, the pre-therapy levels of TRECs were similar to those in the uMS patients and HD, but the levels increased at 6 months of therapy and remained constantly higher than in the uMS patients for the treatment period. KRECs in the pmlMS patient peaked after 6 months of therapy and reached the values observed in the other nMS patients (in whom KRECs were significantly higher than in uMS patients and HD for the period of treatment), but the number of KRECs decreased to significantly lower values when PML developed.</p>

Some anomalies were observed before therapy initiation and others during therapy or after PML diagnosis. Indeed, whereas in nMS patients the percentage of all T- and B-cell subsets analyzed at all time points was not different from that in HD, a lower percentage of recent T emigrants (RTE) and naive B cells as well as a higher percentage of CD8<sup>+</sup>CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>&#x2212;</sup> effector memory T (TEMRA) lymphocytes, and of immature and unswitched memory B cells were found in the pmlMS patient before therapy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034493.s004">Table S1</xref>). The totality of B-lymphocyte percentage increased in this patient at 6 months of therapy (T1), with naive B cells increasing from 0 to 71.9%. In contrast, the significantly lower percentage of RTE and the high frequency of TEMRA observed in the pre-treatment sample remained for the entire period of treatment and were particularly evident when PML occurred. The defects involving these two T-cell subsets were evident also when the results were expressed as cell/&#xB5;L and, despite the increase of B-cell percentage, the number of all B-cell subsets remained very low for the entire study period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034493-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

        <title>T-cell repertoire heterogeneity analysis and Ig production</title>

As previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Gran1">[29]</xref>, the TCRBV9 chain is one of the preferentially expressed TCRBV segments, at least at one time point of the follow up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034493-g004">Figure 4</xref>). All nMS patients, including the pmlMS patient, showed a more or less perturbed TCRBV repertoire (from 5 to 10 TCRBV CDR3 were skewed in comparison to CDR3 distribution observed in HD) before therapy beginning, but natalizumab induced a further strong restriction of the TCR repertoire only in the pmlMS patient. Similarly, to investigate whether anomalies of the B-cell compartment affected humoral immunity, we measured the concentrations of IgA, IgG, and IgM. In all samples of the pmlMS patient, IgG were under the lowest levels observed in HD. They were also significantly lower than those in nMS patients, with the only exception being the sample obtained at T1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034493-g005">Figure 5</xref>). IgM were under the cut-off level only at the moment of PML and were significantly lower than in the other nMS patients in the pre-therapy sample. Moreover, oligoclonal bands were found in the CSF both before natalizumab treatment and after PML diagnosis. Quantification of free Ig light chains was found to be normal and without alteration of the kappa/lambda ratio in serum and CSF.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Currently, there are no specific ways to predict which natalizumab-treated patients are at risk for PML, except for the length of the therapy, the presence of anti-JCV antibodies, and a previous therapy with immunosuppressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Sandrock1">[30]</xref>. Tests for JCV detection in blood or urine do not provide predictive information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Rudick1">[31]</xref>, and there are no defined immune abnormalities that can be used predictively. Furthermore, concerning the pathogenesis of PML, there are only a few certainties; the relative contributions of risk factors, including the role of a biological agent used to treat a disorder in PML development, are still unknown and, similarly, it is still incompletely understood how the virus infects the CNS. Indeed, after primary infection, JCV persists in the kidneys of healthy individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Chesters1">[32]</xref>; there might be reactivations of the latent forms present in the kidneys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Yogo1">[33]</xref>, tonsils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Monaco1">[34]</xref>, and lymphoid progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Sabath1">[9]</xref>, but the virus probably infects the CNS only in the case of alteration of the immune response, as in the case of HIV infection and/or treatment with immune system-modulating compounds. Alternatively, the virus primarily infects the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-PerezLiz1">[35]</xref> and persists there for many years. These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive. Once JCV is in the CNS, it may be controlled by T cells that migrate into the CNS; in the case of an altered immune response, this control might be reduced and full blown viral infection can emerge. Thus far, the results concerning the immune response during natalizumab therapy are conflicting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Chen1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Jilek1">[22]</xref>, and a case of PML has also been described in an apparently immunocompetent patient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Naess1">[36]</xref>. Here, we demonstrate that in the patient who developed PML, some immune cell alterations were already present before therapy initiation, some were induced by the therapy and others developed at the time of PML diagnosis. In particular, in this patient, TRECs and KRECs were detected at very low levels before natalizumab treatment. This patient's age was similar to that of three other natalizumab-treated patients who, however, showed much higher number of TRECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034493.s003">Figure S3</xref>); this suggests that the TREC dependency on age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Serana2">[37]</xref>, which is even more prominent in MS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Thewissen1">[38]</xref>, does not explain the low TRECs observed in pmlMS patient. Our results should not be biased by any residual effects of previous immunosuppressants because, while it has been reported that mitoxantrone apparently persists in the body for as long as 272 days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Fox1">[39]</xref>, the patient that developed PML stopped receiving this drug 4.5 years before starting natalizumab therapy. Furthermore, the deficit of TRECs and KRECs was not observed either in nMS3 and nMS4 patients, who had stopped mitoxantrone respectively 6 and 4 years before natalizumab initiation, or in other MS patients that had received mitoxantrone in the past (data not shown). Finally, we have not found a relationship between the mitoxantrone doses and TREC or KREC levels.</p>
      <p>The anomalies of TRECs and KRECs were respectively confirmed by the low percentage and number of RTE, which represent the T-cell subpopulation recently released from the thymus, and by the low or absent naive and mature B cells found in the peripheral blood. Defects of T-cell production persisted in the pmlMS patient for all the treatment period but did not result in a decrease in the total CD4 and CD8 cell number, probably because of the peripheral T-cell expansion. This expansion could be sustained by CD4 T<sub>EM</sub> cells, which peaked at 15 months after natalizumab treatment beginning; by CD8 lymphocytes, which were particularly high at 12 months of therapy; and by TEMRA lymphocytes, which were very high for the entire period of observation. In particular, TEMRA, which were shown to be generated upon homeostatic proliferation in the absence of antigen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Geginat1">[40]</xref> and described to be the mediators of inflammation and cytotoxicity, were also found to be up-modulated during the treatment of MS patients with fingolimod, a drug that reduces the recirculation of proinflammatory T cells to the periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Mehling1">[41]</xref>. The presence of a peripheral expansion of T cells was confirmed by the skewed T-cell repertoire observed in the pmlMS patient and by the further reduction in TCRBV diversity at the moment of PML diagnosis.</p>
      <p>The release of KREC<sup>+</sup> cells from the bone marrow increased dramatically at 6 months of therapy, when KRECs reached the values observed in the other nMS patients, but after PML, it suddenly decreased to levels lower than those of HD. KREC increase is sustained by the induction of transcripts present in lymphocyte precursors, especially of Vpre&#x3B2;1, which is selectively expressed at the early stages of B-cell development, namely, in pro-B and early pre-B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Bauer1">[42]</xref>. Indeed, among the marker transcripts expressed during lymphocyte development, Vpre&#x3B2;1 was the most increased in pmlMS patient in comparison to pre-therapy level, while, as already reported by Krumbholz et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Krumbholz1">[19]</xref>, DNTT transcripts were predominantly increased in nMS patients that did not develop the PML. DNTT gene encodes a DNA polymerase that catalyzes the addition of deoxynucleotides to the 3&#x2032;-hydroxyl terminus of the rearranged B-cell receptor and TCR gene segments. In vivo, the encoded protein is expressed in a restricted population of pre-B and pre-T lymphocytes during early differentiation, where it generates antigen receptor diversity by synthesizing non-germ line elements at the junctions of rearranged Ig heavy chain and TCR gene segments.</p>
      <p>The use of frozen cells is a limitation of the study because freezing might affect the flow cytometry analysis. Accordingly, while we have adapted and validated the assay for the use of cryopreserved PBMC and we have monitored the quality of the frozen cells to ensure reliable results in phenotypic assay, we have found that CD10 cell surface expression on CD19<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes is decreased and more variable when thawed PBMC are analyzed (personal observation). Therefore we could not quantify the number of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD10<sup>+</sup> pre-B cells, but it is already known that this B-cell subpopulation is highly increased in natalizumab-treated patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Krumbholz1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The increased KREC production resulted in a higher percentage of naive B-cells, whose number, however, remained very low for the entire period of the study. Accordingly, IgG were lower than in nMS patients and HD, with the only exception of the moment in which KRECs peaked. However, the lack of a significant difference in IgG levels between pmlMS and nMS patients at T1 appeared to be more related to the decreased IgG observed in nMS patients than to a hypothetical rise following the sharp increase in KREC production. Indeed, the fact that natalizumab treatment impairs the homing to the tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Saure1">[43]</xref> may interfere with the maturation of B cells and the subsequent production of Ig. Even if the ability of JCV to replicate in B lymphocytes is controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Chapagain1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Houff1">[45]</xref>, the virus has been found in B cells from lymphoid tissues of PML patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Houff2">[46]</xref>, and seems capable to reside in cells of this lineage presumably long enough to employ them as a potential vehicle to cross the blood-brain barrier and transmit the infection to the oligodendrocytes in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Chapagain1">[44]</xref>. The frequent association of PML with B-cell malignancies, or with disorders in which a widespread B-cell activation is routinely observed, may support the hypothesis that B-cell activation can lead to JCV activation in B cells productively infected by JCV. In fact, it has been demonstrated that natalizumab leads to an upregulation of cell nuclear transcription factors involved in B-cell activation and differentiation and, perhaps, in JCV expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Lindberg1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Berger3">[48]</xref>. Thus, it could also potentially lead to JCV expression, replication and even genetic mutation to a neurotropic strain. Indeed, although it has been well recognized that re-arrangements in the noncoding control region are important for enabling JCV to replicate effectively in glial cells, point mutations such those of the VP1 protein have been suggested as contributors of PML development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0034493-Sunyaev1">[49]</xref>. While the specific site of the JC viral genome alteration remains uncertain, the intracellular presence of the virus in cells of the B-cell lineage, which are uniquely engineered to modify the genome, strongly implicates their importance.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our data indicate that the profound impairment of cellular and humoral immunity in the pmlMS patient both before and during the therapy may have predisposed our patient to PML development. Furthermore, our data suggest that the assay for TRECs/KRECs may help identify MS patients at risk of developing PML. The validation of these risk candidates needs further studies in larger cohorts of prospectively followed patients undergoing long-term natalizumab therapy.</p>
