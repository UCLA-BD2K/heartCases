        <p>A 7-year-old female boxer dog died suddenly without any clinical signs. It was suspected
that the dog had arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) due to ventricular
premature complexes and ventricular tachycardia at 3 years of age. The final diagnosis of
ARVC was confirmed by histological characteristics, such as loss of cardiocytes and
fibrofatty replacement, occurring in the right and left ventricular walls. In the
cardiocytes, non-lipid vacuoles were observed. Cardiac fibrosis and intimal thickening of
the small arteries occurred without fatty replacement in the inner muscle layer including
the papillary muscles of the left ventricular wall. This paper describes the
pathomorphological details of an ARVC case with coincidental cardiac fibrosis in the inner
muscle layer of the left ventricular wall.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a type of cardiomyopathy. ARVC has
been reported in boxer dogs and resembles human ARVC [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. ARVC in
dogs has been reported in some breeds [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and among
them, the condition in boxer dogs is particularly known to be familial [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The symptomatic features of ARVC in
boxer dogs are ventricular arrhythmias originating from the right ventricle, syncope and
sudden death. In order for boxer dogs to be diagnosed with ARVC, it is necessary to carry out
various examinations including electrocardiogram, a cardiac echo, observation of clinical
signs and histopathology [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A histopathological examination is helpful for postmortem diagnosis of
this disease [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. ARVC in boxer dogs is characterized by
loss of cardiocytes (cardiac myocytes) and fatty or fibrofatty replacement in the right and
sometimes left ventricular walls [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The mutations of some desmosomal proteins or
non-desmosomal proteins in humans [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and some non-desmosomal proteins in boxer dogs [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] have been reported as the cause of ARVC. Here, we
report an interesting case of boxer ARVC with the features of non-lipid vacuoles in the
cardiocytes and cardiac fibrosis accompanied by the intimal thickening of small arteries in
the inner muscle layer including papillary muscles of the left ventricular wall.</p>
    <p>A 7-year-old female boxer dog died suddenly without any clinical signs. In the screening
examination at 3 years of age, the electrocardiogram showed ventricular premature complexes,
which were of a left bundle branch block morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.
1A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Electrocardiogram; a boxer dog with ARVC. (A) The electrocardiogram showed ventricular
premature complexes (VPC), which were left bundle branch block morphology, at 3 years
old. Lead II, 50 mm/s, 0.5 cm/mV. (B) Ventricular tachycardia is observed by the Holter
monitoring (arrowheads).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-1299-g001"/></fig>). Additionally, the Holter monitoring showed ventricular premature complexes of more
than 1,000 times a day and occasional ventricular tachycardia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1B</xref>). These findings suggested that the dog was afflicated with
ARVC. However, no clinical signs (syncope, exercise intolerance, etc.) were detected until
sudden death at 7 years of age. The heart was removed and fixed in 10% formalin for postmortem
diagnosis. On the transversal cross section after fixation, slight thinning of the right
ventricular wall and yellowish change around the outer layer of the ventricular wall were
found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Gross features on the transversal cross section of the heart after fixation in 10%
formalin. Thinning of right ventricular wall and yellowish change at outer layer of the
ventricular wall are noted.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-1299-g002"/></fig>). For the histopathological examination, the heart was trimmed, embedded in paraffin,
sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE), Masson&#x2019;s trichrome and modified
elastica van Gieson (using Sirius red substitute for fuchsin acid). Oil red O stain was also
performed with formalin-fixed frozen sections. For transmission electron microscopy, the
specimens were cut from four different parts: the outer and middle muscle layers of the right
ventricular wall and the inner muscle layer and papillary muscles of the left ventricular
wall. They were cut into small blocks and washed in distilled water for 30 min. They were
post-fixed in 1% osmium tetra-oxide and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultra-thin sections were
mounted on copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with an
H-7600 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi High-Tech Fielding Co., Tokyo, Japan).</p>
    <p>Histopathologically, loss of cardiocytes and fibrofatty replacement occurred in the outer and
middle muscle layers of the right ventricular wall, extending from the epicardium toward the
endocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Heart, right ventricular wall; a boxer dog with ARVC. (A) Loss of cardiocytes and
fibrofatty replacement are observed in the outer and middle muscle layers. RV, right

of the various-sized surviving cardiocytes, from hypertrophied large to atrophied small ones
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3B</xref>). These cardiocytes occasionally had
vacuoles, which were negative for oil red O staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig.
3C</xref>). Some cardiocytes had lipofuscins, which stained greenish blue by the Schmorl
method. Mononuclear cells infiltrated multifocally, but necrotic cardiocyte features, such as
karyopyknosis and hypereosinophilic sarcoplasm with loss of cross-striations, were not
visible. In the outer muscle layer of the left ventricular wall, loss of cardiocytes and
fibrofatty replacement occurred mainly in the confined area near the epicardium. As compared
to the right ventricular wall, the area of fibrofatty replacement was limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_004" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Heart; left ventricular wall; a boxer dog with ARVC. (A) Loss and fibrofatty

is limited. HE stain. Bar=1 mm. (B) Fibrosis is remarkable in the papillary muscle

The cardiocytes of all layers in the left ventricular wall were hypertrophied and had
lipofuscins. These findings were similar to the ones previously reported in boxer dogs with
ARVC [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
    <p>In the inner muscle layer including the papillary muscles of the left ventricular wall,
fibrofatty replacement was not observed, but multifocal fibrosis was remarkable. The fibrosis
occurred apart from tendinous cords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4B</xref>). The
cardiocytes with vacuoles were also distributed near the fibrotic area in the inner muscle
layer including the papillary muscles of the left ventricular wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4C</xref>). The intimal thickening of the small arteries was clearly
shown by the modified elastica van Gieson stain near the fibrotic area of the inner muscle
layer including the papillary muscles of the left ventricular wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4D</xref>). In the left ventricular side of the interventricular septum,
hypertrophic cardiocytes, slight fibrosis and intimal thickening of small arteries were
observed as in the left ventricular free wall. The vascular lesions were present only in these
mural arteries in the inner muscle layer of the left ventricular wall and in the
interventricular septum. Other mural arteries and coronary arteries remained intact.</p>
    <p>Cardiac conduction systems, such as the sinoatrial node, atrioventricular node and the bundle
of His, showed no particular lesions in the HE and Masson&#x2019;s trichrome stainings.</p>
    <p>Ultrastructurally, the cardiocytes of the outer or middle muscle layers of the right
ventricular wall had some vacuoles, which were surrounded by a single layer membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_005">Fig. 5A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_005" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>Heart; right ventricular wall; a boxer dog with ARVC.

<italic>&#xB5;</italic>m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-1299-g005"/></fig>). Many highly electron dense materials corresponding to lipofuscins upon light
microscopy were found in the cardiocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_005">Fig. 5B</xref>).
The intercalated disks were of a high electron density, and the myofibrils were loosely
associated around the intercalated disks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_005">Fig. 5C</xref>).
In the inner muscle layer and papillary muscles of the left ventricular wall, the cardiocytes
also had many vacuoles and high electron dense materials corresponding to lipofuscins. The
intercalated disks also had a high electron density, and the myofibrils were loosely
associated around the intercalated disks. There were no morphological differences in the
abnormalities of the cardiocytes between the outer or middle muscle layers of the right
ventricular wall and the inner muscle layer including the papillary muscles of the left
ventricular wall. There were no lipid-like structures in the cardiocytes.</p>
    <p>We diagnosed this case as ARVC according to information gathered from this study including an
abnormal electrocardiogram, findings from the Holter monitoring, sudden death without clinical
signs, distinctive histopathological findings and abnormal ultrastructural features [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The loss of
cardiocytes and fibrofatty replacement in the right ventricular wall, were particularly
characteristic of ARVC and have been occasionally observed in both the atria and left
ventricular walls in boxer dogs [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In our case, these histopathological findings were also
detected in both the left and right ventricular walls. In human ARVC, d&#x2019;Amati <italic>et
al</italic>. reported a unique morphological pattern suggesting a progressive
transdifferentiation from myocytes to adipocytes to help explain the pathogenetic mechanism of
adipose replacement [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As an evidence of
transdifferentiation, they found myocytes adjacent to the adipose tissue showing multiple
sarcoplasmic vacuoles and found these cells to have both myocytic and adipocytic
characteristics according to the immunohistochemical and ultrastructural examinations [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In boxer dogs with ARVC, vacuoles in cardiocytes were
reported, but not proved to be lipid vacuoles [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In
our case, no lipid droplets stained with oil red O in the cardiocytes showing vacuolation, and
no lipid-like structures were observed upon ultrastructural examination. We presume the
non-lipid vacuoles in the cardiocytes were dilated endoplasmic reticula, because they were
encircled with a single layer membrane. Therefore, we surmise that the fat cells in the
fibrofatty replacement area were derived from the coronary or intramural connective tissue to
fill up the vacancy, created by the gentle cardiocyte loss in this case.</p>
    <p>The left ventricular wall in our case showed not only fibrofatty replacement of cardiocytes
in the outer muscle layer but also cardiac fibrosis without fatty infiltration in the inner
muscle layer including the papillary muscle. Basso <italic>et al</italic>. reported that 48%
of boxer dogs with ARVC had fatty or fibrofatty replacement in the left ventricular wall
[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, left
ventricular cardiac fibrosis without fatty replacement at the inner muscle layer has not been
previously reported in boxer dogs with ARVC. In our case, there was no histopathological
relationship between fibrofatty replacement and cardiac fibrosis, because the distribution was
different. The relationship between ARVC and cardiac fibrosis remains unclear, and the
pathogenetical relationship between cardiac fibrosis and intimal thickening of the small
arteries of the left ventricular wall and septa is not sufficiently explained. However, with
regard to these relationships, we hypothesize the following: it is known that one of the
causes of cardiac fibrosis is long-standing myocardial damage [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In our case, intimal thickening of the small arteries was detected near the
cardiac fibrotic region. Therefore, the small arteries with intimal thickening may have
induced the regional ischemia [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The regional ischemia
results in oxygen deficiency damaging the cardiocytes, which require high oxygen. The cause of
the intimal thickening may be a reaction to vascular endothelial injury. One of the possible
causes of endothelial injury is an abnormality of the local arterial blood flow [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Arrhythmia due to ARVC may cause the abnormality of the
local arterial blood flow. Therefore, we have speculated that the cardiac fibrosis in this
case was secondary to ARVC over a long-term progression.</p>
