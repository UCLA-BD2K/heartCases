      <abstract>
        <p>Photodynamic therapy has been described as an effective therapeutic option in
selected cases of anogenital lichen sclerosus that are refractory to first-line
treatments. However, procedure-related pain is a limiting factor in patient
adherence to treatment. The authors report the case of a 75-year-old woman with
highly symptomatic vulvar lichen sclerosus, successfully treated with
photodynamic therapy. An inhaled 50% nitrous oxide/oxygen premix was
administered during sessions, producing a pain-relieving, anxiolytic, and
sedative effect without loss of consciousness. This ready-to-use gas mixture may
be a well-tolerated and accepted alternative to classical anesthetics in
Photodynamic therapy, facilitating patients' adherence to illumination of
pain-prone areas.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic, autoimmune, inflammatory skin disease of
uncertain aetiology. Vulvar LS is associated with severe discomfort and morbidity.
Several treatment modalities have been proposed, with the most available evidence
for potent topical corticosteroids. When unresponsive to medical therapies,
photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been described as a potential alternative,
demonstrating symptomatic benefit in small series studies and case
reports.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, pain is
still a major limitation to this technique and an important cause of treatment
discontinuation.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 75-year-old woman presented with a 15-year history of vulvar lichen sclerosus. She
was highly symptomatic, reporting a persistent burning sensation, pain, and pruritus
worsened during micturition. Physical examination showed a shiny, ivory,
smooth-surfaced plaque surrounding the vulva, with important atrophy causing labial
and clitoral resorption, in addition to narrowing of the introitus. Histopathology
confirmed the diagnosis of LS. Treatment with clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment
and amitriptylin 10 mg/day for 7 months produced little symptomatic relief.
Photodynamic therapy using methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) was then instituted. MAL
cream was applied to the entire labia, with an occlusive dressing for three hours,
followed by illumination with red light, 630nm wavelength at a light dose of 37
J/cm<sup>2</sup> for 8 minutes and 20 seconds, at a distance of 8cm between the
device and the lesion surface. An inhaled 50% nitrous oxide/oxygen premix was
administered using a face mask, yielding conscious sedation and pain relief during
the entire treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). Gas flow was
controlled by a sensitive demand-valve activated by the patient&#x2019;s inspired breath.
Three minutes after the beginning of gas inhalation, PDT was initiated, subject to
preliminary moderate sedation (in accordance with the Winsconsin Sedation Scale).
Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen peripheral saturation and sedation score were
monitored throughout the procedure. Sedation was reversed using oxygen therapy at a
flow rate of 5 litres per minute for 5 minutes. A total of four PDT sessions were
performed. Treatment between sessions included daily amitriptylin and emollient. A
visual analogue scale was used to evaluate response to treatment, through a daily
record of the intensity of symptoms (from 0 to 10), including dysuria, pain and
pruritus.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Patient compliance during PDT treatments under conscious sedation was total, with
tolerance to pain, no need for local anaesthesia, and no side effects to report.
Symptomatic relief was reported as early as one week after the first treatment.
Complete and persistent remission of dysuria has been observed ever since. Pain and
pruritus diminished by up to 80% from baseline after the first two treatments,
recurring 10 and 9 weeks later, respectively. However, a long-lasting response was
experienced after the third session, with absent to mild pain or pruritus during
nine months, before recurrence and the need for a fourth treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>). Overall, while clinically unchanged,
symptomatic response has been observed following each PDT treatment, with longer
intervals between sessions, and great improvement in the patient&#x2019;s quality of
life.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Procedure-related pain is a limiting factor in patient adherence to PDT. This adverse
event exhibits great interpersonal variation, but is also related to predisposition
factors such as location, extent and type of lesion, photosensitizer, fluence,
irradiance, and light source. Pain control strategies during PDT have been studied,
but none has proved completely effective. For instance, topical anesthetics have
proved ineffective in controlling pain during PDT. In addition, injectable
anesthetics, though useful, are associated with considerable pain when infiltrated
in extensive and pain-prone areas, and lack anxiolytic effect.<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
      <p>When inhaled, a ready-to-use medical gas mixture consisting of 50% nitrous oxide and
50% oxygen produces a pain-relieving, anxiolytic and sedative effect without loss of
consciousness. It is fast-acting, as the first effects are felt shortly after 4-5
inhalations. It is also self-regulated and rapidly eliminated from the body through
pulmonary excretion once inhalation stops, allowing for a quick recovery. This gas
premix has proved safe with minimal, reversible side effects that include
drowsiness, euphoria and nausea.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>
It has been widely used over the past decades in short-term procedures where
analgesia and sedation with rapid onset and offset, have been sought. While commonly
employed in areas such as dentistry, obstetrics, or pediatrics, its use in
dermatology appears to be marginal in the literature.<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> No use in
PDT has been reported so far.</p>
      <p>To the authors&#x2019; knowledge, this is the first case reporting the use of inhaled
nitrous oxide/oxygen gas mixture during PDT performed in the genital area. In the
case described, the extension and localization of LS would hardly enable a
non-traumatic perineum illumination, as this is a well-recognized pain-prone area.
Pain control through the use of this gas mixture facilitated patient adherence to
PDT, with no need for treatment interruptions, and acceptance of subsequent
sessions.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the use of a 50% nitrous oxide/oxygen gas premix may be an economic,
safe, well-tolerated and accepted alternative to classical anesthetics in PDT.
Easily administered by a trained doctor or nurse, either in inpatient or outpatient
settings, it is an attractive, potential adjuvant for numerous, painful
dermatological procedures.</p>
