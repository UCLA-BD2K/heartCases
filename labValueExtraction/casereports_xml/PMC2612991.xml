      <abstract>
        <p>A middle-aged Asian gentleman presented with four weeks&#x2032;
history of recurrent redness, pain and deterioration of vision
in his right eye. He was diagnosed with chronic, unilateral,
granulomatous hypertensive uveitis. During one of the serial
examinations a single, off-white, extremely motile, thread-like
worm about 15 mm long was noted in the anterior chamber.
Surgical retrieval of the worm was unsuccessful. The worm
disappeared in the eye and was never seen again. Patient suffered
from chronic waxing and waning granulomatous inflammation
with uncontrolled high intraocular pressure despite treatment.
The vision dropped down to no perception of light. Therapeutic
success in such patients depends upon early and complete
surgical removal of the worm, which could be a real challenge as
worms are highly motile and only visible sporadically, as in this
case. Ocular parasitosis should be kept in mind as a differential
diagnosis in treating non-responsive chronic hypertensive
granulomatous inflammation, especially if the patient is of
Southeast Asian origin or has recently visited the region.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Ocular parasitosis is a rare and sight-threatening condition
faced by clinicians mainly in developing nations. The presence
of a live worm poses unique challenges. Physical presence
of the worm or toxins released by the dead worm could
lead to chronic granulomatous hypertensive uveitis. Ocular
parasitosis, as a cause of hypertensive uveitis has not been
reported in the past.</p>

      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>A middle-aged Asian gentleman living in Nepal presented with
four weeks&#x2032; history of recurrent redness, pain and deterioration
of vision in his right eye. There were no significant ocular
problems in the past. Medical history and systemic examination
was unremarkable.</p>
      <p>On ocular examination, visual acuity in the right eye was
20/80 and in the left eye was 20/20. Slit-lamp examination
showed ciliary congestion, corneal haze and mutton fat keratic
precipitates on the corneal endothelium. There was moderate
anterior chamber activity. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 35
mm Hg in the affected eye. Posterior segment examination was
normal. Examination of the fellow eye was normal. He was
treated with oral Diamox 250 mg thrice daily, topical Predforte
1% every hour, Timolol 0.5% twice daily and Alphagan twice
daily in the affected eye. During serial examinations, initially,
mutton fat keratic precipitates fainted quickly on intensive
steroid therapy but, later on, inflammation and raised IOP
seemed non-responsive to the treatment. During one of the
examinations a single, off-white, extremely motile, thread-like
worm about 15 mm long was noted in the anterior chamber
[<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The IOP was still 32 mm Hg. A complete blood
count revealed mild eosinophilia. Thick and thin peripheral
blood smears were normal and standard three consecutive stool
examinations did not show any parasitic ova or cyst.</p>
      <p>The appearance of the worm resembled Angiostrongylus sp.
(most likely <italic>A. cantonensis</italic>), which is a nematode (roundworm)
prevalent in Southeast Asian countries.</p>
      <p>Surgical retrieval of the worm was tried but was unsuccessful.
The worm disappeared in the eye and was never seen again
during serial repeated examinations. Patient suffered from
chronic waxing and waning granulomatous inflammation
with uncontrolled high IOP despite treatment. He denied any
further surgical interventions. The vision dropped down to no
perception of light. The eye eventually, went into phthisis over a
period of 24 months. Patient was counselled for enucleating the
phthysical globe for histopathological diagnosis, prevention of
late complication and better cosmetic appearance. He declined
enucleation as the eye was stable and comfortable.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Parasitic infestation is a major health problem in tropical
countries. Common ocular parasites are Toxocara,
Onchocerca, Wuchereria, Ankylostoma, Loa, Dirofilaria and
Angiostrongylus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Ocular angiostrongyliasis has been reported
from Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Japan, Thailand, Indonesia and
Papua New Guinea.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> It has never been reported as a cause of
hypertensive uveitis.</p>
      <p>Rat is the definitive host of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic>. The intermediate
host is the snail or slug. Humans acquire the infection by eating
raw or undercooked snails or slugs infected with the parasite.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
It is thought to enter the eye by the hematogenous route and
possibly favours the anterior chamber owing to the presence
of free fluid or the cooler temperature or both.</p>
      <p>Chronic inflammation and raised IOP in the eye could
be either due to the physical presence of a motile worm or
immune reaction to the toxins released from the dead worm
or both. Therapeutic success depends upon early and complete
surgical removal of the worm, which could be a real challenge
as worms are highly motile and only visible sporadically. A
slight change in the microenvironment during corneal section
leads to increased motility and sometimes disappearance of
the worm in the eye.</p>
      <p>Ocular parasitosis should be kept in mind as a differential
diagnosis in treating non-responsive chronic hypertensive
granulomatous inflammation, especially if the patient is of
Southeast Asian origin or has recently visited the region.</p>
