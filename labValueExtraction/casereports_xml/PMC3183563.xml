          <p>As cesarean sections become a more common mode of delivery, they have become
the most likely cause of vesicouterine fistula formation. The associated

surgery, offers a 3-dimensional view of the operative field and allows for
intricate movements necessary for complex suturing and dissection. These
qualities are advantageous in vesicouterine fistula repair.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Vesicouterine fistulas are an uncommon phenomenon. Since the first case reported by
Knipe in 1908, these fistulas have been estimated to account for 1% to
4% of all genitourinary fistulas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup> During the first
half of the century, prolonged labor and vaginal obstetric procedures contributed to
the formation of vesicouterine fistulas. In 1957, Youssef reported on the syndrome
which now bears his name: bladder injury during cesarean delivery that causes
vesicouterine fistula formation. The classic symptoms of Youssef's syndrome are
amenorrhea and cyclic hematuria coinciding with time of expected menstruation, or
menouria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup> As lower uterine
segment cesarean deliveries have increased in popularity, they have become the more
common cause of vesicouterine fistula formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Treatment options include conservative management, such as bladder decompression with
indwelling Foley catheter or medical management to induce amenorrhea to aid in
fistula healing. Surgical removal of the fistulous tract, historically via
laparotomy, is also an option. As minimally invasive surgery becomes utilized more
frequently in both gynecologic and urologic procedures, laparoscopic and even
robotic-assisted laparoscopic repair of vesicouterine fistulas are viable treatment
options.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></sup></p>
      <p>We present the case of a robotic-assisted laparoscopic repair of a vesicouterine
fistula occurring after a patient's fourth cesarean delivery.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 34-year-old, G4P4, Caucasian female with a past medical history significant for
obesity with BMI 31.2, dyslipidemia, and 3 prior cesarean deliveries, underwent a
presumptively uncomplicated cesarean delivery where the low-transverse hysterotomy
was reapproximated in one layer. Upon expressing retained clots from the uterus
after the procedure, it was noted that she had transient hematuria that resolved the
next day. Four weeks after her delivery, the patient reported watery vaginal
discharge. A tampon test was performed, which showed vaginal extravasation of urine.
The patient was referred to a urologist, who performed an office cystoscopy, noting
the presence of a posterior fistula. The fistula was cauterized, and the patient
underwent bladder decompression with a Foley catheter for 4 weeks. She then
underwent repeat cystoscopy, which showed resolution of her fistula. Two weeks
later, she again reported urinary leakage from her vagina. Cystoscopy was again
performed, while the patient was menstruating, and the well-epithelialized fistula
was visualized with bloody efflux through the tract. This confirmed the presence of
a recurrent vesicouterine fistula. She underwent a second fulguration of the fistula
with subsequent bladder decompression and was placed on continuous oral
contraceptives to induce amenorrhea. She continued to have urinary leakage for 10
months after her cesarean delivery, despite these conservative measures. She was
referred by her obstetrician for evaluation of laparoscopic repair of her persistent
vesicouterine fistula.</p>
      <p>Pelvic examination with the speculum revealed urine present in the vaginal vault.
Urine was also visibly expressed during valsalva and cough. Bimanual pelvic
examination showed a 6-week size uterus that was anteverted, mobile, and mildly
tender to palpation. Transvaginal sonogram demonstrated a lower uterine segment
vesicouterine fistula measuring 0.56cm.</p>
      <p>The patient chose to undergo another repair of her vesicouterine fistula, along with
an abdominoplasty by her plastic surgeon. She underwent a hysteroscopy, cystoscopy,
robotic-assisted laparoscopic vesicouterine fistula repair, lysis of pelvic
adhesions, and abdominoplasty.</p>
      <p>During hysteroscopy and cystoscopy, a 0.5-cm fistulous tract was visualized
connecting the anterior lower uterine segment to the bladder. This tract was
confirmed after injecting indigo carmine through the HUMI (Coopersurgical, Trumbull,
CT) into the uterus and visualizing extrusion of dye into the bladder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Laparoscopically, there were dense
adhesions from the anterior cul-de-sac to the bladder and lower uterine segment.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The procedure was performed with the da Vinci Standard Surgical System (Intuitive
Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA). Robotic electrosurgical scissors, bipolar forceps, and
needle holders were the instruments utilized to perform the procedure. One 12-mm
cannula was placed through the umbilicus for the laparoscope. One 8-mm, steel
accessory port was placed 5cm superior and 1cm medial to each anterior superior
iliac spine. A 10-mm assistant port was placed 2cm above the umbilicus between the
camera port and right accessory port.</p>
      <p>Initially, the vesicouterine peritoneal reflection was dissected to the level of the
fistula, and the bladder mucosa was visualized. After venous infusion of indigo
carmine, the ureteral outflow jets were seen bilaterally, distal to the fistulous
tract. The epithelialized tissue surrounding the fistula was carefully excised until
healthy tissue remained. The same procedure was performed on the uterine portion of
the fistula. Minimal electrocautery was used to avoid subsequent damage to healthy
tissue. Number 0 polyglactin suture was used in a running fashion to repair the
bladder in 2 layers. Prior to placing the first stitch, the ureteral ridge was noted
to be far from the area of repair. The small hysterotomy remaining after excision of
the fistulous tract was reapproximated with 2 number 0 polyglactin figure of eight
stitches. Bladder and uterine distention was performed with sterile water, and the
closures were noted to be water tight. The patient was returned to the supine
position after the robot was undocked and the omentum was brought down over the
bladder. The operative time for the robotic-assisted laparoscopic vesicouterine
fistula repair with hysteroscopy and cystoscopy was 190 minutes. Estimated blood
loss was 100cc.</p>
      <p>The plastic surgeon then completed the patient's abdominoplasty. The patient did
well postoperatively and was discharged on the second postoperative day with an
indwelling Foley catheter. Two weeks after the procedure, a CT cystogram revealed no
evidence of bladder extravasation of contrast or a fistulous tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The Foley catheter was discontinued.
Three months after her surgery, the patient reported continence and resolution of
menouria.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Vesicouterine fistulas are an uncommon occurrence, although with the rising numbers
of cesarean deliveries being performed, the frequency of these genitourinary
fistulas may increase. Bladder injury during cesarean delivery has been frequently
reported as a cause of vesicouterine fistulas. This may involve inadequate downward
mobilization of the bladder, direct injury to the portion directly adherent to the
lower uterine segment or anterior vaginal wall, aberrant suture placement or
excessive devascularization or infection from cauterization, clamping, or hematoma
formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref></sup> Prior uterine
scars may also play a role in the formation of vesicouterine fistulas. During labor,
the thinning of the lower uterine segment may cause uterine scar dehiscence. This
shearing force during uterine rupture may be transmitted to the bladder, causing
subsequent development of a fistula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup> Other less common causes of vesicouterine fistula include
uterine rupture, manual removal of the placenta, placenta percreta, local tumor
invasion or radiation injury, and contraceptive intrauterine device causing uterine
injury. Rarely, congenital anomalies, pelvic infections, such as tuberculosis or
actinomycosis, and uterine artery embolization have been implicated as causes of
these fistulas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Diagnosis of vesicouterine fistulas is often accomplished with a combination of
patient symptoms and clinical examination. A tampon test may be performed after the
patient ingests medication containing a dye excreted in the urine, such as
phenazopyridine or Prosed (Ferring Pharmaceutical, Parsippany, NJ). The clinician
may also instill saline combined with methylene blue or indigo carmine into the
bladder and monitor extravasation through the cervical os. Simple radiological
methods, such as an intravenous urogram or cystometrogram can confirm and identify
the exact location of the fistula. Sonohysterography, transvaginal ultrasound,
computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging have also been utilized to
diagnose vesicouterine fistulas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Management of vesicouterine fistulas can either be approached conservatively or
through surgery. If the fistula occurs soon after delivery, bladder decompression
with a Foley catheter for at least 3 weeks has been shown to be effective in aiding
spontaneous closure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref></sup> Others have
advocated hormonal suppression of menstruation with bladder decompression to allow
the tract to close without the continuous flow of menstrual blood. Oral
contraceptives, progestational agents, and gonadotropin releasing hormone analogs
have been used to induce amenorrhea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref></sup> J&#xF3;zwik and J&#xF3;zwik<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref></sup> discovered that when hormonal suppression was
utilized, the likelihood of spontaneous resolution of the fistula was 89% as
opposed to &lt;5% without suppression. Cystoscopic fulguration of the
vesicular portion of the fistula has also been proven to be effective in specific
cases of vesicouterine fistula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref></sup></p>
      <p>When conservative management fails, surgical treatment has been the mainstay of
therapy. The basic surgical principles for repair of a genitourinary fistula are
wide exposure with liberal excision of scar tissue around the fistula; tension-free
closure of the wound in multiple layers with absorbable suture; and possible
transposition of an omental or myouterine flap to obliterate dead space and prevent
hematoma formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref></sup> The method of
performing the repair has traditionally been approached through a laparotomy
incision, but recently, laparoscopic and robotic repair have been
accomplished.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></sup></p>
      <p>To date, there has only been one published report of 3 robotic-assisted laparoscopic
vesicouterine fistula repairs by Hemal et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></sup> This procedure differed from the previously published
report, because only one accessory port was necessary to perform the procedure, as
opposed to the 2 to 3 accessory ports reported by Hemal et al. The estimated blood
loss was similar at an average of 120mL, as was the hospital stay where the patients
were discharged on postoperative days 2 and 3. Although the operative times reported
by Hemal et al ranged from 60 minutes to 115 minutes, the operative time of this
procedure was longer at 190 minutes. Attributing factors to the increased operative
time could be the addition of hysteroscopy and cystoscopy to the procedure and the
patient's obesity. They also reported discontinuing the Foley catheter at 10
days, and their 3 patients were asymptomatic and continent at 3 months, which was
consistent with this patient's outcome. Laparoscopic repair of vesicouterine
fistulas has also been reported, but the data are limited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Robotic-assisted laparoscopy offers the advantages of fine tissue manipulation and
dissection and improved visualization of the operative field. The advantages of
laparoscopic surgery also apply to robotic surgery, such as faster postoperative
recuperation, shorter hospitalization course, cosmetic benefits, and decreased blood
loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref></sup> Fistula prevention
by sound surgical technique and early identification of risk factors for fistula
formation is of paramount importance. However, in the presence of a fistula
refractory to conservative management, surgical intervention may be accomplished by
robotic-assisted laparoscopy.</p>
