      <abstract>
        <p><bold>Purpose:</bold> To describe a precannulated fenestrated endograft system utilizing externalized guidewires to facilitate aortic arch endovascular repair and to report its use in 2 patients with challenging anatomy. <bold>Technique:</bold> For distal arch repair, a fenestration for the left subclavian artery (LSA) is made onsite in a standard thoracic endograft tailored to the patient anatomy; it is precannulated with a nitinol guidewire (NGw), which is passed from the femoral artery and externalized from the left brachial artery prior to endograft delivery system introduction over a parallel stiff guidewire. Steps are then taken to remove guidewire intertwining, prevent NGw wrapping around the delivery system, and orient the LSA fenestration superiorly when the delivery system moves into the arch. Gentle traction on the ends of the NGw during endograft deployment facilitates proper fenestration alignment. A covered stent is deployed in the LSA fenestration. The technique is illustrated in a patient with congenital coarctation of the aorta and descending aortic aneurysm. For total arch repair, endograft fenestrations are made for all 3 arch branches; the left common carotid artery (LCCA) and LSA fenestrations are each cannulated with NGws, which travel together from the femoral artery, pass through a LSA snare loop, and are exteriorized from the LCCA. After endograft deployment, the innominate artery fenestration is separately cannulated using right brachial access. Placement of a parallel externalized hydrophilic guidewire passing through the LCCA fenestration (but not the LSA snare loop) and removal of the LCCA fenestration NGw allows exteriorization of the LSA fenestration NGw from the left brachial artery by pulling the LSA snare. Covered stents are deployed in all 3 fenestrations. The technique is presented in a patient with type B aortic dissection. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Use of the precannulated fenestrated endograft system described is feasible and has the potential to make aortic arch endovascular repair simpler, more reliable, and safer.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Endovascular repair is an effective way of treating aortic arch pathology,<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and fenestrations in the endografts can help preserve flow into supra-aortic branches destined to be covered by the device.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="bibr3-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr4-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x2013;<xref rid="bibr5-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Precise deployment of these fenestrated arch endografts is important to correctly orient the fenestrations toward the branches for which they are intended. The fenestrations must then be cannulated if covered stents are to be deployed through them into the side branches to achieve a seal at each location. This process requires manipulation of wires, catheters, and even partially deployed endografts in the aortic arch, all of which can cause embolization of atherothrombotic material. It is therefore desirable to have a system that allows full deployment of a fenestrated arch endograft immediately after introduction, facilitates correct orientation of the fenestrations, and minimizes subsequent manipulations to cannulate these openings. Here, we describe a system that achieves these objectives by externalizing guidewires that traverse fenestrations made onsite in standard thoracic endografts prior to their insertion. The use of the system is illustrated in 2 patients with pathology in the aortic arch and beyond in whom the use of fenestrated endografts would have otherwise been difficult.</p>

        <title>Aortic Arch Endograft With a Single Fenestration</title>
        <p>Aortic arch endografts with a single fenestration are useful for treating distal arch pathology where the proximal landing zone commences at the distal margin of the left common carotid artery (LCCA) origin and blood flow into the left subclavian artery (LSA) needs to be preserved; however, such endografts could also be used to preserve flow into the LCCA or the innominate artery (IA) if the more distal arch branches are revascularized by other means, such as bypass surgery.</p>

          <title>Step 1. Endograft Modification</title>
          <p>A Valiant Captivia thoracic endograft (Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, CA, USA), selected based on careful study of the patient&#x2019;s computed tomography angiography (CTA) images, is fully deployed on a sterile table without releasing the tip-capture mechanism. A single fenestration for the LSA of appropriate size and location is made in between the endograft stent struts, in line with the radiopaque figure-8 mid-marker, using a thermal cautery instrument.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Thereafter, a radiopaque nitinol wire is sewn onto the edge of the fenestration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1526602815614557">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

          <p>A needle hole is made in the introducer sheath (graft cover) just distal to the section bearing the endograft, and a 300-cm, 0.018-inch nitinol guidewire (NGw; RoadRunner, Cook Medical Inc, Bloomington, IN, USA) is passed cephalad into the sheath through the needle hole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1526602815614557">Figure 1B</xref>); another needle hole is made in the cup-shaped stent-stop, and the same NGw is passed through it to travel through the endograft, traverse the fenestration, and continue cephalad external to the endograft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1526602815614557">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1526602815614557">B</xref>). The endograft is resheathed using umbilical tape, which must pass under the NGw in the section of endograft cephalad to the fenestration so that the wire is not embedded within the folds of the constrained endograft. The NGw will now emerge from under the tip of the introducer sheath, in line with the LSA fenestration and figure-8 mid-marker; it can be moved through the constrained endograft without much friction, allowing easy adjustment of its length on either side.</p>

          <title>Step 2. Preliminary Catheter-Guidewire Manipulation</title>
          <p>A 0.035-inch, angled hydrophilic guidewire (HGw; Terumo Medical, Somerset, NJ, USA) introduced from the right femoral artery (RFA) is exteriorized from the left brachial artery (LBA) using a snare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1526602815614557">Figure 2A</xref>). The femoral end of the HGw is passed through a hole made in the outer aspect of the primary curve of a 7-F Judkins right guiding catheter, which is then tracked over it into the aortic arch to allow parallel delivery of a Lunderquist guidewire (LGw; Cook Medical) into the ascending aorta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1526602815614557">Figure 2B</xref>). The catheter is then removed without rotation (to prevent guidewire intertwining), leaving the 2 guidewires in place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1526602815614557">Figure 2C</xref>). Finally, a 125-cm, 5-F multipurpose catheter is passed over the HGw from the LBA so that its tip emerges from the RFA access, after which the HGw is removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1526602815614557">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>

          <title>Step 3. Exteriorization of the Fenestration-Cannulating Guidewire</title>
          <p>The sheath in the RFA is removed, and the endograft delivery system is loaded onto the LGw. However, prior to introducing it into the RFA, the cephalic end of the NGw that traverses the endograft fenestration is passed from the RFA access and exteriorized from the LBA through the multipurpose catheter, which is then removed. The NGw remains externally located at both ends throughout the procedure and can be removed at any stage by simply pulling either end. When the endograft delivery system is passed up the aorta over the LGw, the NGw is allowed to move along with it, and the resulting slack in the part of the NGw cephalic to the delivery system is eliminated by exteriorizing more of it from the LBA. The part of the NGw in the LSA is kept within a catheter or long sheath to prevent wire-induced vessel wall injury.</p>

        <sec id="section7-1526602815614557">
          <title>Step 4. Undoing Guidewire Intertwining</title>
          <p>The NGw may twist around the LGw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1526602815614557">Figure 2E</xref>) despite step 2; these spiral twists will come closer together and become more obvious as the endograft delivery system is advanced into the thoracic aorta and will prevent successful completion of the procedure. Guidewire intertwining, if evident on left anterior oblique view fluoroscopy, is eliminated by rotating the endograft delivery system when its tip is in the mid-descending thoracic aorta. The direction of rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise) is determined by trial and error; rotation in the appropriate direction will lead to progressive reduction in guidewire intertwining seen on fluoroscopy. Once intertwining is completely removed, the 2 guidewires will cross each other only once, in the aortic arch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1526602815614557">Figure 2F</xref>). The NGw will now emerge from the medial aspect of the delivery system (toward the inner curve of the aortic arch), in line with the fenestration and figure-8 mid-marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1526602815614557">Figure 2F</xref>). This position of the delivery system can be considered the &#x201C;neutral&#x201D; position, which is of relevance in subsequent steps of the procedure.</p>

        <sec id="section8-1526602815614557">
          <title>Step 5. Ensuring Superior Orientation of the Endograft Fenestration in the Aortic Arch</title>
          <p>As the branch artery takes off from the arch&#x2019;s superior aspect, it is necessary to position the delivery system such that the endograft fenestration is oriented superiorly when it enters the arch. This is achieved by the following maneuver. First, the plane of the aortic arch is determined by selecting the precise right anterior oblique angulation of the image intensifier in which the curve of the LGw in the thoracic aorta appears on edge (ie, the parts of the LGw in the ascending and descending aorta are superimposed). Next, the aortic arch is viewed en face by fluoroscopy in the left anterior oblique angulation perpendicular to the previous view. In this view, the delivery system is rotated by about 180&#xB0; from the &#x201C;neutral&#x201D; position described above, such that the endograft fenestration and the figure-8 mid-marker are positioned laterally (toward the outer curve of the thoracic aorta, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1526602815614557">Figure 3A</xref>). Advancement of the delivery system from this position into the aortic arch without further rotation will result in the endograft fenestration being oriented superiorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1526602815614557">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>

          <title>Step 6. Avoiding Wire Wrap Around the Tapered Tip of the Delivery system</title>
          <p>The 180&#xB0; rotation of the delivery system away from the &#x201C;neutral&#x201D; position causes the NGw to cross the tapered tip of the delivery system in the descending aorta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1526602815614557">Figure 3A</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1526602815614557">D</xref>); this could potentially result in wire wrap around the tapered tip when the delivery system is advanced into the aortic arch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1526602815614557">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1526602815614557">G</xref>), precluding successful completion of the procedure. Wire wrap can be avoided by the following maneuver. If the NGw crosses anterior to the LGw in the aortic arch, the 180&#xB0; rotation of the delivery system should be clockwise so that the NGw crosses anterior to the tapered tip of the delivery system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1526602815614557">Figure 3A</xref>). Conversely, if the NGw crosses posterior to the LGw in the aortic arch, the 180&#xB0; rotation should be counterclockwise so that the NGw crosses posterior to the tapered tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1526602815614557">Figure 3B</xref>); this will prevent wire wrap when the delivery system is moved into the aortic arch.

          <title>Step 7. Avoiding Snagging of the Guidewire Around the Endograft Tip</title>
          <p>Once the introducer sheath is advanced past the LSA origin, the NGw will bend backward sharply (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1526602815614557">Figure 4D</xref>) and may snag a stent strut at the tip of the endograft when the latter is deployed. NGw snagging can be avoided by unsheathing the FreeFlo (uncovered stent) and a bit of the first covered stent segment of the endograft when the tip of the introducer sheath is located under the LSA origin, while applying gentle traction on both ends of the NGw. This allows the NGw to peel off the proximal edge of the aortic endograft. The unsheathed part of the endograft remains unexpanded at this stage, and the delivery system can be moved further ahead if required while maintaining gentle traction on both ends of the NGw.</p>

      <title>Case 1</title>
      <p>The above technique is illustrated in a 31-year-old obese (body mass index 36.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) male smoker with hypertension and diabetes who was incidentally found to have congenital coarctation of the aorta (peak systolic pressure gradient 38 mm Hg) and a post-stenotic fusiform descending thoracic aortic aneurysm (maximum transverse diameter 6.8 cm) that extended downward to 8 cm above the celiac artery origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1526602815614557">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1526602815614557">B</xref>). Endovascular treatment was planned despite the young age of the patient as he had medical comorbidities and was keen to avoid open repair. Preservation of flow into the LSA was desirable as extensive endograft coverage of the descending aorta was required. However, the complex anatomy and sharply angulated takeoff of the LSA precluded use of a chimney graft and made correct orientation of a fenestrated endograft difficult; use of an externalized guidewire to facilitate the latter was therefore considered.</p>
      <p>The procedure was performed under general anesthesia after obtaining written informed consent that included the use of a physician-modified endograft. An 8-mm circular fenestration was made with its center 35 mm from the proximal edge of a 26&#xD7;164-mm Valiant Captivia thoracic endograft as described earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1526602815614557">Figure 1A</xref>). RFA, LBA, and right radial artery accesses were obtained percutaneously. Three Proglide sutures (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were deployed in the RFA and tied at the end of the procedure. After baseline angiography and pressure measurements, the aortic coarctation was dilated using a 20-mm-diameter Maxi LD balloon (Cordis Corporation, Bridgewater, NJ, USA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1526602815614557">Figure 4C</xref>). The delivery system was advanced into the aortic arch without wire wrap as described earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1526602815614557">Figure 4D</xref>). A 6-F diagnostic catheter introduced from the right radial artery was used to delineate the LCCA angiographically during endograft deployment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1526602815614557">Figure 4E</xref>). A 7&#xD7;38-mm V12 covered stent (Atrium Medical/Maquet Cardiovascular, Hudson, NH, USA) was deployed within the LSA fenestration. Simultaneous balloon dilation was performed using a 22-mm Maxi LD balloon in the coarctation segment and a 7-mm balloon in the LSA stent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1526602815614557">Figure 4F</xref>). An overlapping 34&#xD7;150-mm Valiant endograft without proximal FreeFlo was deployed in the lower descending aorta. A good angiographic result was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1526602815614557">Figure 4G</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1526602815614557">H</xref>) with no endoleak and preserved flow into all the aortic arch branches; the peak systolic pressure gradient across the coarctation segment fell to 15 mm Hg. The procedure took 137 minutes, including 54 minutes of fluoroscopy. The postoperative period was uneventful except for LBA access site thrombosis, which was successfully resolved by aspiration using a 6-F guiding catheter introduced from the left radial artery. There were no neurological deficits or other complications. A spinal drain was not used during or required after the procedure.</p>
      <p>The patient remained well and asymptomatic, though a type II endoleak through coarctation-related collateral channels was noted. Eight months after the procedure, the patient presented acutely with left lower limb pain and numbness, with absent distal pulses in this limb. CTA revealed separation of the 2 descending aortic endografts with type III endoleak, suggesting inadequate overlap between the 2 aortic endografts when deployed. Thrombus from the repressurized aneurysm sac had probably embolized downstream, causing left lower limb ischemia. Using percutaneous RFA access as before, a 34&#xD7;202-mm Zenith thoracic endograft (Cook Medical) was deployed bridging the 2 existing endografts and successfully abolishing the endoleak. The LSA stent was noted to be patent and undistorted, with normal flow through it. The left lower limb ischemia resolved completely with anticoagulant therapy. The patient has been asymptomatic since then; CTA at 6 months after the second procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1526602815614557">Figure 4I</xref>) revealed structural integrity of the endografts, a patent LSA stent, and reduction in aneurysm size.

        <title>Aortic Arch Endograft With Multiple Fenestrations</title>
        <p>In cases where an endograft has to be deployed starting from zone 0, fenestrations are required for all 3 arch branches unless other techniques of preserving side branch flow are utilized. Correctly deploying and cannulating a triple fenestrated endograft can be challenging, especially if the aortic anatomy is unfavorable; therefore, it would be helpful if the technique described earlier for an endograft with a single fenestration could be extended to an endograft with 2 or 3 fenestrations. However, this would involve the use of additional guidewires (one for each fenestration), which could wrap or intertwine in myriad ways. This problem can be solved by 2 measures:</p>

The true lumen was slit-like, and all the abdominal aortic visceral branches arose from it. There was extensive left hemothorax with partial lung collapse. Endovascular treatment was planned as he was high risk for surgery. In view of the proximity of the large proximal entry tear to the LSA origin and closeness of the arch branch origins to each other, it was decided to use a triple-fenestrated endograft, landing its proximal edge in the distal ascending aorta. The risk of cerebral embolization was considered fairly high as there was wide true-false communication very close to the arch vessels and large thrombus burden in the adjacent false lumen. The treatment plan therefore included use of externalized guidewires for 2 fenestrations to facilitate rapid endograft deployment with minimal manipulation and transient balloon occlusion of the cerebral vessels during endograft delivery and deployment in the aortic arch.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Compared with the abdominal aorta, where custom-made and onsite fenestrated endografts have been used fairly extensively, the aortic arch has so far witnessed a much more limited use of fenestrated endografts. The reasons for this discrepancy are mainly the technical difficulty of correctly deploying a fenestrated arch endograft and cannulating its fenestrations on one hand and the higher risks involved, mainly that of stroke, on the other. The 2 reasons are partly related, as incorrect endograft deployment increases subsequent manipulations, which in turn increases the risk of embolization from the aortic arch. A system that increases the margin of safety available in the deployment of fenestrated arch endografts, facilitates correct orientation of the fenestrations, and minimizes subsequent manipulations may therefore be expected to increase successful outcomes and reduce complications.</p>
      <p>In the arch endograft system described above, the fenestrations are circular, do not have stent struts going across them, and are of comparable size to the target vessel; these features allow sealing by deployment of covered stents within the fenestrations. The fenestration-covered stent combination serves to anchor the fenestration to its target branch and preserve blood flow in it (obviating the need for surgical bypass) and prevents both type III endoleak from the fenestration and type II endoleak from the branch. Also, since sealing starts at the proximal edge of the aortic endograft, proximal arch and distal ascending aortic lesions can potentially be treated if endograft deployment begins sufficiently proximally. A small margin of safety in endograft deployment is available because even if the fenestrations are slightly off target, the precannulating NGws will enable deployment of covered stents within them. During deployment of single-fenestrated endografts, traction on the exteriorized ends of the NGw traversing the fenestration may help orient the latter toward its target vessel; in endografts having 2 NGws that traverse separate fenestrations but otherwise travel together, traction forces will act on both fenestrations and may help orient them superiorly.</p>
      <p>Successful use of the described precannulated fenestrations requires an understanding of how guidewire intertwining and wire wrap can be avoided. The preventive steps are performed with the delivery system in the mid descending aorta, where risk of cerebral embolization due to device manipulation is low. If these steps are properly executed, the delivery system needs to move into the aortic arch just once, and after minor adjustments in position, the endograft can be fully deployed, lining the arch and trapping debris underneath it. Quick endograft delivery and deployment in the aortic arch enabled by our system makes it possible to transiently occlude the cerebral vessels during this step, which has the highest potential for cerebral embolization; however, setting up and taking down the triple-balloon occlusion system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1526602815614557">Figure 8A</xref>) added significantly to the procedure and fluoroscopy times in case 2. Without the assistance of the above-described system of precannulated fenestrations, it may be necessary to manipulate a semiconstrained or partially deployed arch endograft to orient fenestrations correctly, which could increase the risk of cerebral embolization.</p>
      <p>Onsite modification of standard endografts has the advantages of making a device appropriate for the patient&#x2019;s anatomy available rapidly and at significantly lower cost than a custom-made endograft; the disadvantages are the necessity for the physician to spend time modifying the endograft, lack of industrial quality control after device modification, and lack of a sizeable body of evidence supporting its use. Modification of commercially available devices by physicians may void any guarantee of safety by the manufacturer, and systematic evaluation of such devices is best done within a protocol approved at the institutional and/or regulatory level.</p>
      <p>The technical complexity of the precannulated fenestrated endograft system described in this report is a limitation that may curtail its widespread acceptance. Certain anatomic variations, such as an anomalous origin of the right subclavian artery from the distal arch or direct aortic origin of a large left vertebral artery, may be a contraindication to the technique. In the presence of a bovine aortic arch, total endovascular repair using 3 endograft fenestrations as described may still be feasible; here, a sufficiently long covered stent in the LCCA fenestration would have to travel through the IA, parallel to the covered stent in the IA fenestration, before entering the LCCA. Extreme arch angulation or severe aortic tortuosity may make endograft delivery and proper orientation of fenestrations challenging, if not impossible.</p>
      <p>The idea of exteriorization of a precannulating guidewire in arch endovascular repair is not new. Murphy et al<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> created on-table a single-branched thoracic endograft preloaded with a HGw and used the device in a post&#x2013;open repair case of type A aortic dissection after bypassing the LCCA and LSA from the IA. The HGw was snared out from the right CCA after the endograft delivery system reached the aortic arch; tension on the HGw helped in orienting the branch toward the IA. A bridging covered stent was deployed for a successful outcome.</p>
      <p>The commercially manufactured Valiant Mona LSA single-branch thoracic endograft system (Medtronic Vascular), which is designed to preserve LSA flow and is currently undergoing clinical evaluation, has an additional guidewire lumen that allows precannulation of a flexible cuff in the endograft. A guidewire advanced through this lumen is snared along the outer curve of the arch and exteriorized from the LBA to allow deployment of a mating branch stent-graft into the LSA from a femoral approach.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In both these techniques,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> the precannulating guidewire is snared and exteriorized only after the endograft delivery system is close to the target arch branch; this reduces the problem of wire wrap but does not eliminate it. In our system, the snaring and exteriorization process is completed before insertion of the endograft delivery system into the patient and is performed using equipment better suited for the purpose (the initial guidewire exteriorized is not the one traversing the fenestration). There is less technical difficulty, hardware clutter, and operator anxiety involved. Precannulation of 2 fenestrations is possible (as against one branch in the other systems); however, guidewire intertwining and wire wrap are likely to occur unless prevented by the maneuvers described above.</p>
      <p>Our onsite fabricated fenestrated endograft system provides an alternative to the fairly limited range of options available for partial or total arch endovascular repair. Apart from the single-branch thoracic endografts described above, another option now available is the Cook inner-branched arch endograft.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> This endograft has 2 internal side branches, each with an enlarged external orifice to assist cannulation. A curved introducer facilitates superior orientation of the endograft branches. The side branch&#x2013;bearing midsection of the endograft is narrower than the ends and separates the side branch external orifices from the aortic wall. This facilitates branch cannulation and preserves perigraft flow. However, the midsection of the endograft does not contribute to debris entrapment or to proximal sealing (which is confined to the ascending aorta). Endograft deployment always has to start from zone 0, even if the patient&#x2019;s anatomy would allow a zone 1 or 2 start with a standard endograft. Another limitation is the need to revascularize the LSA surgically before endograft deployment in all cases. The early global experience with this device in 38 patients was published recently.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The technical success rate was 84.2%, 30-day mortality 13.2%, and cerebrovascular complications 15.8%; there were no aneurysm-related deaths.</p>
      <p>Multiple centers in Japan have reported extensive experience with the use of custom-made arch endografts having large fenestrations that increase the margin of safety during deployment.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Precurved stainless steel endograft frames and J-shaped delivery sheaths ensure that the fenestrations are oriented superiorly when the endograft is deployed; the main advantage of this system is its relative simplicity. As the fenestrations are rectangular, larger than their target vessels, and may have stent struts going across them, they cannot be sealed by deploying covered stents within them; consequently, a &gt;15- to 20-mm proximal sealing zone is required distal to the LCCA, and only pathology in the distal aortic arch and beyond can be treated. The LSA is usually simply occluded. Deployment of these endografts from zone 0 or 1 of the aorta increases their stability (which may compensate for their relatively low radial strength) and provides better sealing along the inner curve of the arch. In a recent study,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> this technique was used in patients with a short sealing zone distal to the LCCA (mean length 11 mm, range 5&#x2013;15); this resulted in a 32.4% type Ia endoleak rate at discharge and 16.2% aneurysm enlargement at follow-up.</p>
      <p>In situ fenestration is another method of preserving blood flow into aortic arch branches covered by an endograft and is done in a retrograde manner using a laser, a long needle, or radiofrequency ablation.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="bibr10-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x2013;<xref rid="bibr11-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> If the IA or LCCA is covered by the endograft, maintenance of antegrade cerebral perfusion using temporary bypass is necessary during the fenestration process.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> A recent study reported 60% technical success in 10 patients using radiofrequency ablation for in situ fenestration.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The chimney graft is yet another competing endovascular technique that preserves flow into endograft-covered aortic arch branches. In a recent review<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> of 182 patients who underwent chimney graft deployment during arch endovascular repair, primary technical success was achieved in 98%, with a 5.3% stroke rate and a 13.6% type Ia endoleak rate. Chimney grafts are a good option for high-risk patients and in bailout situations. Though the short- and midterm results have been good, questions remain regarding durability and material interaction in the long term. The Multilayer Flow Modulator (Cardiatis, Isnes, Belgium), a bare, self-expanding, braided wire tube that induces gradual aneurysm thrombosis while preserving flow in the main vessel and side branches, is an off-the-shelf device that is easy to use. Experience with this device in the treatment of aortic arch aneurysms has been extremely limited.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The performance of each of these endovascular techniques needs to be viewed against the backdrop of the well-established open surgical and hybrid techniques of aortic arch repair, which even today carry considerable mortality and stroke risk.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-1526602815614557" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Aortic arch endovascular repair using the precannulated fenestrated endograft system described in this report is feasible. The system has the potential to make arch repair simpler, more reliable, and safer. It enables utilization of longer and more proximal sealing zones and makes possible percutaneous total arch repair using unconstrained fenestrated endografts. Systematic clinical evaluation of the system is required before its status in comparison to alternative techniques can be ascertained.</p>
