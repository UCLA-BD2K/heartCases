      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Radiation retinopathy is a well-established, dose-dependent complication after radiation therapy. The most characteristic signs result from vascular decompensation caused by radiation damage. The rapid onset of unilateral macular atrophy without peripheral retinopathy after radiation has rarely been reported in the literature. In this report, we describe an unusual case of radiation maculopathy in a stage 4 lung cancer patient receiving targeted therapy that was initially thought to be caused by ocular toxicities. We present the clinical ocular findings and describe the manifestation of ischemic radiation maculopathy, which may be of value to ophthalmologists and radiation oncologists.</p>

      <title>Case report</title>
      <p>A 55-year-old female presented to our eye clinic because of blurred vision in the right eye for 1 month. She had a medical history of stage 4 nonsmall cell lung cancer which was treated using targeted therapy with Gefitinib and had finished whole-brain radiation therapy 2 months earlier (40Gray [Gy] in 16 fractions) for brain metastasis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A and B). There was no history of diabetes, hypertension, or systemic vascular disease. There was no other ocular history of note. At the initial assessment, she had best-corrected visual acuity of finger counting at a distance of 30 cm in the right eye and 6/6 in the left eye. The intraocular pressure, anterior segment, optic disc, and retinal vessels were unremarkable bilaterally. No relative afferent pupillary defect was noted in either eye. Fundus examination showed loss of foveal light reflex of the right eye (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) showed macula atrophy with diminished photoreceptor IS/OS junction of the right eye with a central retinal thickness of 229&#x200A;&#x3BC;m and several intraretinal cystic spaces, compared with 278&#x200A;&#x3BC;m in the left eye (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A and B). She scored 0/15 on color plates for the right eye. The standard automated perimetry showed paracentral scotoma visual field defect of the right eye in contrast to the left eye (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A and B). Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) of the right eye revealed an enlarged diamond-shaped clear-cut foveal avascular zone in the macula that was disc-sized with peripheral surrounding microaneurysms and telangiectatic vessels in the zone margin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). The FFA of the left eye presented with normal foveal avascular zone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). Indocyanine green chorioangiography (ICG) showed normal choroidal vessels. No latency or reduced amplitude of the P100 component of the visual-evoked cortical potential (VEP) was observed. The full-field electroretinogram (ERG) response of the right eye showed no markedly reduced amplitude or significant abnormality. A review of the patient's medical history did not reveal anything of concern with respect to diabetic retinopathy. Taken together, the severe ischemic macular change and the findings of clinical examinations suggested a diagnosis of radiation maculopathy. The high dose of radiation delivered further supports the diagnosis. She was regularly followed up in our clinic. No cotton wool spots or blot hemorrhages, retinal neovascularization, or vitreous hemorrhage were noted, and visual acuity of both eyes remained the same after 6 months. Antiplatelet medication (low-dose aspirin, 100&#x200A;mg per day) was considered appropriate at this stage.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This case report describes the development of unilateral fulminant maculopathy after whole-brain radiation therapy without underlying medical or drug history. The area of the eye that appears to be most sensitive to radiation damage is the posterior pole. Radiation maculopathy typically develops when radiation exposure extends beyond tissue tolerance. The earliest and most common clinical feature of radiation maculopathy is macular edema,<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> which can lead to ischemic maculopathy. Initially, the capillary endothelial damage from ionizing radiation results in patches of capillary nonperfusion. Subsequent ophthalmoscopic and angiographic changes reflect features of vascular occlusion in the retina layers and choroid, including microaneurysms, retinal hemorrhages, intraretinal exudation, nerve fiber layer infarcts, perivascular sheathing, and retinal or optic disc neovascularization.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> The primary event is probably endothelial cell damage with secondary loss of pericytes. This histologic picture is similar to that seen in diabetic retinopathy. The macular edema after radiation generally precedes ischemic change. Once ischemic maculopathy has evolved, visual improvement is unlikely. In contrast to typical evolved vascular change patterns in radiation maculopathy, the OCT of this patient revealed attenuation of central macular thickness with loss of photoreceptor IS/OS junction rather than macular edema. The FFA in our case further showed unilateral ischemic maculopathy without other extramacular abnormality as the only manifestation in the unilateral eye.</p>
      <p>It has been reported that the total cumulative dose of radiation, the fraction size, concomitant chemotherapy, the presence of diabetes mellitus, collagen vascular disease, or pregnancy are important in the development of retinopathy.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> A reported safe dose is 3000&#x200A;rads/30 Gy, 1000&#x200A;rads/10 Gy per week in 5 fractions (200&#x200A;rads/2 Gy per session).<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Absence of radiation retinopathy was observed in eyes receiving &lt;40 Gy, whereas the incidence of retinopathy was 10% and 50% in eyes receiving doses of 40 to 60 and &gt;60 Gy, respectively.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Parsons and colleagues<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> recommend that individual dose fractions should not exceed 1.8 to 1.9 Gy. In the recent Cochrane database review of radiotherapy for macular degeneration, no retinopathy or optic nerve damage was reported in 1154 patients treated with doses up to 24 Gy.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> The latent period before the onset of clinically significant retinopathy is typically 6 months to 3 years, but has been known to occur &gt;15 years after radiotherapy.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> The latent period is shorter after higher dose radiotherapy.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup></p>
      <p>A higher than recommended radiation dose was prescribed in our case (2.5 Gy per session) due to multiple brain metastases. The retinal photoreceptors are radio-resistant and retinal atrophy usually develops after long-standing retinal detachment or macular edema. However, in this case, the macular ischemia and atrophy of the IS/OS junction developed rapidly without peripheral retinopathy. There were no other underlying vascular diseases that have a potentiating effect in the pathogenesis of vascular impairment of retina. Morever, the rapid onset of unilateral maculopathy developing 1 month after completing treatment with whole-brain radiation therapy has rarely been reported.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup></p>
      <p>Gefitinib is an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). It is administered daily during radiation therapy and continued daily after the completion of radiation therapy as the target therapy for metastatic lung cancers. Reported ocular and periocular adverse reactions of EGFR inhibitors include trichomegaly, periorbital rash with associated ectropion, and persistent corneal epithelial defect formation. Posterior ocular segment toxicities have not been reported.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the radiation-sensitizing effects of gefitinib in brain tumors. However, there is poor drug penetration to brain tumors owing to the existence of the blood&#x2013;brain barrier (BBB).<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Hence, the concentration of gefitinib in retina vessels was likely not responsible for the development of maculopathy.</p>
      <p>Different treatment regimens have been advocated in the management of radiation maculopathy. Focal laser photocoagulation, intravitreal anti-VEGF injections, and intravitreal dexamethasone implant have been used for radiation-induced macular edema and retinal or choroidal neovascularization.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> However, improvement in visual acuity after injection appears to be short term and is seen only in a few patients. Oral pentoxyphylline has been reported to increase visual acuity and decrease the number of hemorrhage dots and cotton wool spots of the macular nonperfusion area. A possible explanation is the unique rheologic properties of pentoxifylline, which cause an increase in blood flow and oxygenation to the damaged retina.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Current therapeutic interventions for radiation maculopathy place greater emphasis on macular edema. In our case, severe macular nonperfusion with impaired photoreceptor cells caused rapid visual loss, and thus, the treatment modality for macular edema was not appropriate. Low-dose aspirin was prescribed to increase retinal circulation. During the following 6 months, however, the visual acuity showed no improvement.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>This case serves to remind both ophthalmologists and radiation oncologists that radiation maculopathy may increase the risk of rapid progression of vision loss. Counseling and fundus examination should be offered in all cases at risk of visual loss before receiving whole-brain radiotherapy. The use of antiplatelet medication that was prescribed in our case may need to be reviewed during long-term follow-up. Further studies are required to determine whether the use of early aggressive therapy for the prevention of radiation retinopathy is beneficial.</p>
