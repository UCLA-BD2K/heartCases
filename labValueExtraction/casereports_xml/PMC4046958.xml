      <abstract>
        <p>Identifying the genetic basis for mitochondrial diseases is technically challenging given the size of the mitochondrial proteome and the heterogeneity of disease presentations. Using next-generation exome sequencing, we identified in a patient with severe combined mitochondrial respiratory chain defects and corresponding perturbation in mitochondrial protein synthesis, a homozygous p.Arg323Gln mutation in <italic>TRIT1</italic>. This gene encodes human tRNA isopentenyltransferase, which is responsible for i<sup>6</sup>A37 modification of the anticodon loops of a small subset of cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs. Deficiency of i<sup>6</sup>A37 was previously shown in yeast to decrease translational efficiency and fidelity in a codon-specific manner. Modelling of the p.Arg323Gln mutation on the co-crystal structure of the homologous yeast isopentenyltransferase bound to a substrate tRNA, indicates that it is one of a series of adjacent basic side chains that interact with the tRNA backbone of the anticodon stem, somewhat removed from the catalytic center. We show that patient cells bearing the p.Arg323Gln <italic>TRIT1</italic> mutation are severely deficient in i<sup>6</sup>A37 in both cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs. Complete complementation of the i<sup>6</sup>A37 deficiency of both cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs was achieved by transduction of patient fibroblasts with wild-type TRIT1. Moreover, we show that a previously-reported pathogenic m.7480A&gt;G mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> mutation in the anticodon loop sequence A36A37<underline>A38</underline> recognised by TRIT1 causes a loss of i<sup>6</sup>A37 modification. These data demonstrate that deficiencies of i<sup>6</sup>A37 tRNA modification should be considered a potential mechanism of human disease caused by both nuclear gene and mitochondrial DNA mutations while providing insight into the structure and function of TRIT1 in the modification of cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Mitochondrial disorders are clinically diverse, and identifying the underlying genetic mutations is technically challenging due to the large number of mitochondrial proteins. Using high-throughput sequencing technology, we identified a disease-causing mutation in the <italic>TRIT1</italic> gene. This gene encodes an enzyme, tRNA isopentenyltransferase, that adds an <italic>N<sup>6</sup></italic>
<sup>-</sup>isopentenyl modification to adenosine-37 (i<sup>6</sup>A37) in a small number of tRNAs, enabling them to function correctly during the synthesis of essential mitochondrial proteins. We show that this mutation leads to severe deficiency of tRNA-i<sup>6</sup>A37 in the patient's cells that can be rescued by introduction of the wild-type TRIT1 protein. A deficiency in oxidative phosphorylation, the process by which energy (ATP) is generated in the mitochondria, leads to a mitochondrial disease presentation. Introducing the mutant protein into model yeast species and measuring the resulting impairment provided further evidence of the pathogenic effect of the mutation. Additional studies investigating a previously reported pathogenic mutation in a mitochondrial tRNA gene demonstrated that a mutation in a substrate of TRIT1 can also cause a loss of the modification, providing evidence of a new mechanism causing mitochondrial disease in humans.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mitochondrial diseases are characterised by biochemical defects in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) enzyme activity and arise as a consequence of nuclear- or mitochondrial-encoded gene mutations <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Vafai1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Generalised disorders of mitochondrial protein synthesis resulting in OXPHOS defects are increasingly reported as causing a clinically heterogeneous group of neonatal and infantile mitochondrial disease presentations associated with isolated or multi-organ involvement <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Calvo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The advent of whole exome capture and sequencing technologies has revolutionised the molecular diagnosis of this patient group <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Pagliarini1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>; the molecular disease mechanism can implicate nuclear gene products involved in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication, synthesis and repair <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Kornblum1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, mitochondrial aminoacyl tRNA synthetases <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Konovalova1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, mitochondrial translation elongation and release factors <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Antonicka1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, structural ribosomal proteins and assembly factors, and enzymes involved in mt-RNA modification <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Nicholls1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Post-transcriptional modification of tRNAs is crucial for folding, stability and function in deciphering the genetic code during translation. Modifications of cytosolic-tRNAs (cy-tRNA) and mt-tRNAs occur notably at nucleotide positions 34 and 37 in the anticodon loop (ACL), serving to promote translational fidelity and efficiency by optimising codon-anticodon fit within the ribosome <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The homologous tRNA isopentenyltransferases (IPTases) are conserved from bacteria to humans and introduce an evolutionarily ancient modification, an isopentenyl group onto <italic>N<sup>6</sup></italic> of adenine at position 37 (i<sup>6</sup>A37). In bacteria, i<sup>6</sup>A37 is further modified by methylthiolation to ms<sup>2</sup>i<sup>6</sup>A37 which uses its methyl-sulphur group to stabilise the intrinsically weak A&#x2013;U pairing between anticodon A36 and the first base of UNN codons <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Jenner1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, the methylthiolation enzymes are not present in eukaryotes, leaving i<sup>6</sup>A37 without further modification.</p>
      <p>To date, functional analysis in eukaryotes comes from studies in yeast which have shown that i<sup>6</sup>A37 promotes translational efficiency and fidelity in a codon-specific manner cognate with the i<sup>6</sup>A37-tRNAs <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Lamichhane1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The presence of i<sup>6</sup>A37 increases the specific activity of a tRNA for its codon about four-fold in <italic>S. pombe</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1004424-Lamichhane1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Prior work on orthologues including MiaA (<italic>E. coli</italic>), Tit1 (<italic>S. pombe</italic>), Mod5 (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), and TRIT1 (human) has revealed specificity for subsets of cy- and mt-tRNAs that bear the single-stranded anticodon loop recognition sequence, &#x2018;A36-A37-A38&#x2019;, although this motif alone is not always sufficient (<xref rid="pgen.1004424-Lamichhane2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and refs therein). However, it has also become clear that due to sequence variability in the tRNAs and the specificities of the transferases, different species contain different subsets of i<sup>6</sup>A37-modified tRNAs <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Lamichhane1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Lamichhane3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Determining the subsets of specific mRNAs that are sensitive to i<sup>6</sup>A37 deficiency and how this contributes to phenotype is a contemporary challenge <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Lamichhane1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We used whole exome sequencing to identify a homozygous p.Arg323Gln mutation in the <italic>TRIT1</italic> gene that segregates within a consanguineous UK-Pakistani family in which affected children present with encephalopathy and myoclonic epilepsy due to multiple OXPHOS deficiencies in skeletal muscle. We confirm that this mutation is responsible for a severe deficiency in the i<sup>6</sup>A37 content of cy- and mt-tRNAs, as it can be reversed by rescue with wild type TRIT1 in the patient's fibroblasts. We show that TRIT1 is targeted to mitochondria and provide evidence in both humans and yeast that this gene is required for efficient mitochondrial function. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that a previously-reported pathogenic A38G mutation of mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup>, causes i<sup>6</sup>A37 deficiency, strengthening the conclusion that TRIT1-related human disease can arise from mutation of either the enzyme or its tRNA substrate.</p>

TRIT1 localized with eIF4E in the cytosol (lane 2) and showed the same profile as GDH (lanes 3&#x2013;6), but was undetectable in the inner mitochondrial membrane fraction (lane 7). A total of 40 &#xB5;g protein was loaded for each sample, and all mitochondrial subfractions were prepared from the same mitochondrial lysate. <bold>D</bold>) Clustal Omega alignment of the TRIT1 protein and known orthologs revealed that the affected amino acid (p.Arg323) is conserved in each species excluding <italic>S. pombe, S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>, where the equivalent amino acid is lysine, which has similar electrochemical properties (:).

        <p>The p.Arg323Gln mutation occurs in exon 8 of the <italic>TRIT1</italic> gene, which also has a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence in exon 1 and a matrin-type zinc finger domain contributed by exons 10 and 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Mitochondrial targeting of TRIT1 is supported by prediction using the freely available online tool, MitoProt II (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ihg.gsf.de/ihg/mitoprot.html">http://ihg.gsf.de/ihg/mitoprot.html</ext-link>) <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Claros1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, with a confidence of 94%. Both cytosolic and mitochondrial localization is predicted by other available databases, as is also the case for its homologs Mod5, Tit1, and GRO-1. Indeed, immunoblotting of whole cell extracts and isolated mitochondrial subfractions confirmed that TRIT1 was present in the cytosolic fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, lane 2) and also detectable in proteinase K-treated mitoplasts (lane 6), consistent with the enzyme being present in the mitochondrial matrix, where tRNA molecules and the translation apparatus are active during protein synthesis. However, at this stage we cannot exclude the possibility that a significant fraction of the cytosolic portion of TRIT1 may be associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane.</p>
        <p>The corresponding position of the affected amino acid, p.Arg323, is occupied by a basic side chain in all homologues from a range of species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), whereas glutamine at this position in the proband is polar but uncharged. Based on the available Mod5-tRNA co-crystal structure <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g002">Figure 2E&#x2013;G</xref>), the position and chemical nature of the mutation was not expected to affect mitochondrial localization, general solubility or gross structural alterations of the enzyme. In Mod5 this position is occupied by p.Lys294 whose basic side chain extends from an &#x3B1;-helix that lies adjacent to, but pointing away from, the catalytic site containing A37 <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Both this and adjacent conserved basic side chains comprise part of a series of residues on the same side of the &#x3B1;-helix, including Arg298 (also arginine in TRIT1) which are involved in binding the phosphate groups of nucleotides 27&#x2013;29 of the AC stem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g002">Figure 2E&#x2013;G</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Based on this we suspected that the mutation would not impair catalytic activity <italic>per se</italic> but might impair proper binding of the enzyme to its tRNA substrates. However, since this mutation would appear to affect only one of a series of contacts with the surface of the tRNA backbone, it was not necessarily expected to cause a severe deficiency of isopentenyltransferase activity.</p>

The cy-tRNA<sup>Ser(UGA)</sup> appears to be fully modified in control fibroblasts (undetectable with ACL probe) consistent with prior results using HeLa cells <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Lamichhane3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> but largely unmodified in patient fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> shows a significant, albeit decreased difference in the ACL signal between control and patient compare to cy-tRNA<sup>Ser(UGA)</sup>. This is due in part to a significant fraction of unmodified mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> in the control cells, again consistent with prior results using HeLa cells <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Lamichhane3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This suggests that wild-type TRIT1 is only partially active on mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> in control fibroblasts. The more similar mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> ACL signals in control and patient fibroblasts is also due in part to a significantly lower amount of the overall level of mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> in the patient, as revealed by the mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> BP. We note that whilst cy-tRNA<sup>Ser(UGA)</sup> showed similar steady-state levels in control and patient cells, the mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> showed a 40% decrease in steady-state level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, quantification not shown but see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g005">Figure 5E</xref>), calculated using the BPs of mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> and mt-tRNA<sup>Cys</sup> as internal calibration standards <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Lamichhane1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Wild-type TRIT1 rescues the i<sup>6</sup>A modification in patient fibroblasts</title>
        <p>Attempts to rescue the i<sup>6</sup>A37 hypomodification observed in patient fibroblasts were met with significant technical challenges that produced variable levels of transient transfection efficiency and ectopic TRIT1 and therefore only partial rescue of the i6A37 hypomodification (data not shown). We therefore used a retrovirus vector-based transduction approach to optimize the percentage of cells expressing ectopic TRIT1. Transduction of control and patient fibroblasts resulted in very high levels of overexpression as compared to the empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), allowing us to examine the i<sup>6</sup>A37 content of tRNAs from patient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Importantly, wild-type <italic>TRIT1</italic> completely reversed the cy-tRNA<sup>Ser(UGA)</sup> hypomodification defect in the patient cells, whereas the empty vector did not, providing strong evidence that the native endogenous mutant TRIT1 protein is responsible for the hypomodification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, compare lanes 7 &amp; 8 with 9 &amp; 10). Given the very high overexpression of TRIT1 in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), it was not surprising based on our mutation structure analysis, <italic>in vitro</italic> modification results and partial rescue of slow growth in glycerol by the mutant TRIT1 protein, that mutant TRIT1 was no less efficacious than wild-type TRIT1 in rescuing the i<sup>6</sup>A37 hypomodification of cy-tRNA<sup>Ser(UGA)</sup> in patient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
        <p>In notable contrast to the rescue of cy-tRNA<sup>Ser(UGA)</sup> hypomodification, the hypomodification of mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> was rescued more efficiently by wild-type TRIT1 than mutant TRIT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Moreover, restoration of i<sup>6</sup>A37 to mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> was specifically associated with an overall increase in the steady state levels of this tRNA as reflected by the mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g005">Figure 5B</xref>; compare lanes 7 and 8 with 9 and 10). Quantification of independent triplicate sample sets revealed that whilst wild-type TRIT1 could effectively recover the i<sup>6</sup>A37 modification level of mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> to that observed in the control fibroblasts, &#x223C;60% (P&#x200A;=&#x200A;0.6286), mutant TRIT1 was significantly less efficient, at &#x223C;20% (P&#x200A;=&#x200A;0.0146) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

        <p>Using U5 snRNA as a loading control and mt-tRNA<sup>Cys</sup> and mt-tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup> as non-substrate mitochondrial controls, the steady-state levels of both cy-tRNA<sup>Ser(UGA)</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) and mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g005">Figure 5E</xref>) (calculated using BPs) in transduced fibroblasts were determined.

However, mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> levels, which were relatively lower in patient fibroblasts, were more efficiently rescued by wild-type TRIT1 (elevated relative to U5: P&#x200A;=&#x200A;0.0162) than by mutant TRIT1 (unchanged relative to U5: P&#x200A;=&#x200A;0.2038) or the empty vector (decreased relative to U5: P&#x200A;=&#x200A;0.0055) when compared to control fibroblasts transduced with empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g005">Figure 5E</xref>, black bars).

        <p>We tried various approaches to rescue the biochemical, respiratory and molecular phenotypes in the patient fibroblasts. However due to limitations associated with the manipulation and transfection of patient and control fibroblasts, we were unable to do so with either wild-type or mutant TRIT1 despite multiple attempts (not shown). It appears that the cells had become less dependent on and/or less expressive of respiratory function with passage and handling.</p>

        <title>The m.7480A&gt;G mutation at position 38 in mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> impairs i<sup>6</sup>A37 modification</title>
        <p>As noted in the Introduction, the tRNA substrates of all characterized isopentenyltransferases have an enzyme recognition sequence of A36A37A38 in their anticodon loops <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Lamichhane2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Thus we decided to further investigate a previously reported patient with mitochondrial myopathy <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Bidooki1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> due to a pathogenic (m.7480A&gt;G) mutation at position 38 in mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup>, a substrate of TRIT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The PHA6 assay using a double ACL probe that matches both the wild type and mutant mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) performed on total RNA extracted from homogenised patient skeletal muscle showed reduced i<sup>6</sup>A37 modification of mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup>, to &#x223C;14% of control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, quantification not shown). Furthermore, the steady-state level of mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> was also decreased by &#x223C;30% in patient skeletal muscle compared to control (quantification not shown). Interestingly, when comparing control skeletal muscle to the previously described control fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), it appears that skeletal muscle harbours relatively more mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> lacking the i<sup>6</sup>A modification. The <italic>in vitro</italic> modification assay was also performed on several synthetic tRNA ASLs, substantiating our finding of a deficiency in modification activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Isopentenyl modification of wild-type mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> (lane 3) <italic>in vitro</italic> is comparable to that observed for the positive controls, cy-tRNA<sup>Sec(UCA)</sup> (Lane 1) and cy-tRNA<sup>Ser(UGA)</sup> (Lane 2). However, the m.7480A&gt;G mutation significantly abolishes <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of TRIT1 on mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> (lane 4) to the level observed in the non-substrates, mt-tRNA<sup>Cys</sup> (Lane 5) and mt-tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup> (Lane 6). Hybridization of ASL probes to synthetic substrates modified <italic>in vitro</italic> by DMAPP was observed by the PHA6 assay to be substantially decreased compared to hybridization of the same probes to unmodified synthetic substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Hybridization of ASL probes to the non-DMAPP substrate mt-tRNA<sup>Cys</sup> was unaffected by treatment with TRIT1. Notably, hybridisation of ASL probes to mutant mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> (m.7480A&gt;G) was unchanged by the DMAPP modification reaction, confirming the loss of i<sup>6</sup>A37 modification in the mutant tRNA. These data validate the PHA6 assay for detection of changes in the i<sup>6</sup>A modification status of substrate mitochondrial and cytosolic tRNAs.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we describe the investigation of a consanguineous kindred in which affected children presented with encephalopathy and myoclonic epilepsy associated with a disorder of mitochondrial translation. Analysis of whole exome sequencing data indicated that this was due to a recessively-inherited p.Arg323Gln mutation in <italic>TRIT1</italic>, the gene encoding the tRNA isopentenyltransferase (IPTase) responsible for i<sup>6</sup>A modification at position 37 in the anticodon loop of a subset of tRNAs <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Golovko1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, including mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup>, consistent with a previous report on i<sup>6</sup>A in bovine mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup>
<xref rid="pgen.1004424-Yokogawa1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to the TRIT1 mutation-associated disorder of mitochondrial dysfunction reported here, we also demonstrated that a m.7480A&gt;G point mutation of mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup>, previously reported as a cause of progressive mitochondrial myopathy <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Bidooki1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, results in i<sup>6</sup>A37 hypomodification. In this case, the point mutation was in the TRIT1 sequence-specific recognition site, A36A37<underline>A38</underline>, of mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup>. The convergence of two different mechanisms, one due to a mutation in the TRIT1 enzyme and the other to a mutation in its substrate mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup>, that both cause i<sup>6</sup>A37 hypomodification of mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> and mitochondrial myopathy, provide strong genetic evidence of the critical importance of i<sup>6</sup>A37 in mitochondrial translation. TRIT1 should therefore be added to the increasing list of genes encoding mitochondrial tRNA-modifying enzymes, including <italic>MTU1</italic>

It is also worth noting that TRIT1 has been reported as a tumor suppressor and certain rare variant alleles are associated with poor survival from lung cancer in some ethnic groups <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Spinola1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Spinola2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>; other mitochondrial-disease associated genes such as GRIM19 have also been implicated as a tumor suppressor <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Kalakonda1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. However, it is not clear whether this is due to a relationship between cellular respiration and the mitochondrial function of TRIT1 in the lungs and/or the enzyme's cytosolic role. In addition, recent work has demonstrated an effect of Mod5 in tRNA-gene mediated gene silencing of RNA polymerase II promoters, suggesting a role for eukaryotic IPTases beyond their tRNA modification activity <xref rid="pgen.1004424-PrattHyatt1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>IPTases are conserved in sequence, structure and catalytic mechanism from bacteria to humans, particularly in the sequence surrounding the TRIT1 p.Arg323Gln mutation site. Indeed, in all of the IPTase sequences examined including <italic>E. coli</italic> MiaA, the targeted residue is either Arg or Lys. The mod5-i<sup>6</sup>A37-tRNA crystal structure shows that this residue comprises one of several basic side chains that contact the acidic backbone of the tRNA anticodon stem suggesting that the semi-conservative Arg to Gln mutation might compromise but not ablate enzyme activity. We therefore expected that any effect of the p.Arg323Gln mutation on TRIT1 activity would not be extreme and that the phenotype would be associated with a moderate decrease in tRNA i<sup>6</sup>A37 modification. However, to our surprise the mutation severely impaired the activity of the enzyme <italic>in vitro</italic> and caused a dramatic loss of i<sup>6</sup>A37 from both cy-tRNA<sup>Ser(UGA)</sup> and mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> in patient fibroblasts. It is important to note that our observation of i<sup>6</sup>A37 modification of cy-tRNA<sup>Ser(UGA)</sup> contrasts with a previous study that could not detect this modification in human cy-tRNA<sup>Ser(UGA)</sup> expressed in monkey-derived CV-1 cells <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Capone1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In all eukaryotes examined, the IPTases modify both cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs and mitochondrial localization is a significant part of the biology. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> employs an intricate system for maintaining proper distribution of Mod5 to the mitochondria, nucleus and cytoplasm <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Gillman1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pgen.1004424-Benko1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. A prominent phenotype of <italic>S. pombe tit1-&#x394;</italic> mutants is slow growth on glycerol, a manifestation of mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Lamichhane1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the extended life span phenotype as well as deregulated development and other phenotypes of <italic>gro-1</italic> mutants can be rescued by the mitochondrial isoform of the GRO-1 IPTase but not the nuclear and cytoplasmic isoform <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Lemieux1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. It is therefore noteworthy that while both cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs are lacking i<sup>6</sup>A37 in patient cells, the manifestations of disease clearly localize to a mitochondrial cause. Therefore, it may be important that in addition to hypomodification of mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup>, the overall levels of the mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> were significantly lower in patient fibroblasts. This suggests that in addition to the &#x223C;4-fold loss of tRNA specific activity due to lack of i<sup>6</sup>A37 <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Lamichhane1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, mitochondrial translation would be even further compromised by a decrease in the absolute level of mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup>. This may contribute to a molecular basis for the apparent sensitization of the mitochondrial-associated phenotype in the patients described here.</p>
      <p>Another informative finding was that the TRIT1-mutant could modify its substrate tRNAs with i<sup>6</sup>A37 when greatly over-expressed in the transduced patient fibroblasts. This was not completely unexpected on the basis of two experimental observations. As noted above, structure modelling suggested that the mutation would affect substrate binding but not i<sup>6</sup>A37 catalytic activity. Indeed, we observed increased transferase activity with increased substrate concentration, at least within the technical limits of the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g003">Figures 3B and 3C</xref>). Second, the TRIT1 p.Arg323Gln mutant manifested partial activity to complement the slow growth in glycerol phenotype in the <italic>S. pombe tit1-&#x394;</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Furthermore, previous studies have shown that this phenotype remains uncomplemented by a prior characterized <italic>tit1-T12A</italic> catalytic mutant that is inactive for i<sup>6</sup>A37 modification of tRNA <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Lamichhane1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Lamichhane2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Thus, the partial complementation of this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004424-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) suggests that the TRIT1 mutant retains some i<sup>6</sup>A37 activity, consistent with high activity of the <italic>nmt1</italic>
<bold><italic><sup>+</sup></italic></bold> promoter in the multi-copy expression vector.</p>
      <p>Recent studies have concluded that although some tRNAs in human cells contain the A36A37A38 TRIT1 recognition motif they accumulate in the i<sup>6</sup>A37-unmodified form <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Lamichhane3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Somewhat similarly, the A36A37A38-containing tRNA<sup>Trp(CCA)</sup> in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> remains unmodified <xref rid="pgen.1004424-Lamichhane2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. This further suggests that the subset of i<sup>6</sup>A37-containing tRNAs may change under different conditions, due to varying concentrations of the enzyme or substrate, a situation that may occur during development and/or other physiological conditions.</p>

Lists of on-target variants were filtered against data from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI, NIH, Bethesda, MD) Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) 6500 exomes, the 1000 Genomes project, and the exome sequences of 315 unrelated in-house control exomes to identify rare homozygous variants with a Minor allele frequency (MAF) &lt;0.01.</p>
        <p>Variant filtering led to a final list of 40 rare, homozygous, protein-altering variants of which 4 were mitochondrial according to the Gene-Ontology database. These genes included <italic>TRIT1, CCDC19, ARSB and SYNJ2</italic> of which <italic>TRIT1</italic> segregated with disease in the family. Targeted resequencing and familial segregation studies were performed by cycle sequencing using an ABI 3130xl (Applied Biosystems) system and BigDye Terminator v3.1 technology.

Fibroblasts were seeded at a density of 30,000 cells/well. Mitochondrial function was assayed through the sequential addition of oligomycin (to 1.3 &#xB5;M) to block the ATP synthase, 2 additions of carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (FCCP), a respiratory uncoupler which drives maximal respiration (to 2 &#xB5;M and then to 3 &#xB5;M), and antimycin (to 2.5 &#xB5;M) to inhibit Complex III.</p>
        <p>Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and proton production rate (PPR) measurements for each well were normalized by cell number. Non-mitochondrial respiration was subtracted from all OCR values prior to analysis; spare respiratory capacity (SRC) equals maximal OCR - basal OCR, ATP coupling efficiency equals (basal OCR - oligomycin-inhibited OCR)/(basal OCR*100). Seven separate control cell lines underwent multiple testing and the means were combined to calculate control data (mean &#xB1; SD; n&#x200A;=&#x200A;7). Patient fibroblasts were tested multiple times (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;21).

In this assay, the isopentenyl group of DMAPP is transferred to A37 in substrate tRNAs by the IPTase TRIT1. The following RNA oligos were designed with an additional G-C base pair added to each ASL to stabilize the stem, and purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT): rGrUrGrCrArGrGrCrUrUrCrArArArCrCrUrGrUrArC (cy-tRNA<sup>Sec(UCA)</sup>), rGrArUrGrGrArCrUrUrGrArArArUrCrCrArUrC (cy-tRNA<sup>Ser(UGA)</sup>), rGrGrGrUrUrGrGrCrUrUrGrArArArCrCrArGrCrUrC (mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup>), rGrGrGrUrUrGrGrCrUrUrGrArArGrCrCrArGrCrUrC (mt-tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup>-A7480G), rGrUrUrGrArArUrUrGrCrArArArUrUrCrGrArC (mt-tRNA<sup>Cys</sup>) and rGrUrArArArArCrUrUrArArArArCrUrUrUrArC (mt-tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup>).</p>
