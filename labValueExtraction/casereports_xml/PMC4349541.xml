      <abstract>
        <p>We investigated the
concentration of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the blood, ovarian
follicular fluid and uterine fluid of a clinical case of bovine metritis. A 2-year-old
lactating Holstein cow exhibited continuous fever &gt;39.5&#xB0;C for more than 2 weeks after
normal calving. The cow produced a fetid, watery, red-brown uterine discharge from the
vagina and was diagnosed with metritis. The LPS concentrations in plasma and uterine fluid
were 0.94 and 6.34 endotoxin units (EU)/m<italic>l</italic>, respectively. One of seven
follicles showed an extremely high level of LPS (12.40 EU/m<italic>l</italic>) compared to
the other follicles (0.62&#x2013;0.97 EU/m<italic>l</italic>). These results might suggest the
presence of high concentration of LPS in follicles in cows with postpartum metritis.</p>

  <body>
    <p>In postpartum dairy cows, uterine bacterial infection commonly occurs and causes infertility
by disrupting uterine and ovarian function. Uterine inflammatory diseases, such as metritis
and endometritis, cause enormous economic losses related to compromised reproductive
performance; conception rates are approximately 20% lower in cows with endometritis, the
median calving to conception interval is 30 days longer, and 3% more animals are culled owing
to failure to conceive [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) is among
the main types of bacteria causing uterine inflammation, and the tissue pathology is largely
associated with the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. LPS has been detected in plasma, uterine fluid [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and follicular fluid [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] of cows
with endometritis, suggesting that LPS derived from uterine inflammation translocates to the
ovary and affects follicular function. However, the occurrence of LPS absorption from the
uterus into the bloodstream or its translocation into the follicle remains controversial
[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. There has been no report comparing the LPS concentration
in different organs of the same animal, which makes it difficult to evaluate the possible
translocation of uterine LPS to the bloodstream or follicles. In the present study, we
evaluated the LPS concentration of blood, follicular fluid and uterine fluid of a clinical
case of bovine metritis.</p>
    <p>A 2-year-old lactating Holstein cow exhibited anorexia and continuous fever &gt;39.5&#xB0;C for
more than 2 weeks after normal calving. Both intrauterine and intravenous administrations of
tetracycline were performed every day during the first week postpartum, and then,
intramuscular injection of ceftiofur sodium was used during the second week postpartum. The
cow showed a fetid, watery, red-brown uterine discharge from the vagina. Transrectal
ultrasonography of the uterus using an ultrasonic scanner (HS-101V; Honda Electronics Co.,
Ltd., Toyohashi, Japan) equipped with a 5-MHz linear-array transducer (HLV-155; Honda
Electronics Co., Ltd.) revealed an enlarged uterus and accumulation of echogenic fluid in the
uterine horns and the uterine body. The cow did not show any clinical signs of mastitis, such
as udder swelling or increased somatic cell count. Based on these findings, the cow was
diagnosed as metritis. On day 23 postpartum, the cow was euthanized according to ethical and
animal welfare requirements under the guidelines of the Care and Use of Agriculture Animals of
Obihiro University (No. 25&#x2013;25), and a post-mortem examination was carried out.</p>
    <p>At necropsy, the right uterine horn was enlarged compared to the left uterine horn (right
uterine horn; length of 24.6 cm and width of 6.0 cm, left uterine horn; length of 18.0 cm and
width of 2.4 cm), and the mucosa of both uterine horns was congested. For histopathological
examination, uterine tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin wax.
Four-<italic>&#xB5;</italic>m-thick sections were deparaffinized and stained using hematoxylin
and eosin. Histologically, all layers of the uterine wall of both uterine horns showed
prominent infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>(a) The right uterine horn was enlarged compared to the left uterine horn (right

endometria of both uterine horns. Infiltration of neutrophils and fibrosis were more prominent
in the right uterine horn compared to the left uterine horn. A uterine swab was obtained from
each uterine horn using a sterile swab (Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., Obihiro, Japan), and the
swab was cultured aerobically and anaerobically at a commercial laboratory (Daiichi Kishimoto
Clinical Laboratory, Inc., Obihiro, Japan). An aerobic gram-positive bacterium,
&#x3B2;-streptococcus group C, was detected from the right uterine horn.</p>
    <p>Intrauterine fluid was aseptically collected from the right uterine horn at the necropsy, and
aliquots of fluid were centrifuged at 600 &#xD7; <italic>g</italic> at 4&#xB0;C for 30 min. Before the
necropsy, blood sample was collected from the coccygeal vein into heparinized tubes and
centrifuged at 1,750 &#xD7; <italic>g</italic> at 4&#xB0;C for 15 min. Follicular fluid from medium to
large follicles (&gt;6 mm in diameter, n=7) was aspirated using a syringe with a 22-gauge
needle and centrifuged at 1,500 &#xD7; <italic>g</italic> at 4&#xB0;C for 1 min. Follicle diameter was
determined from the weight of follicular fluid, as previously described by Murasawa <italic>et
al.</italic> [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Obtained supernatants of uterine
fluid, blood and follicular fluid were stored frozen at &#x2212;30&#xB0;C in pyrogen-free siliconized
glass tubes until the LPS assay. The LPS concentrations in the uterine fluid, plasma and
follicular fluid were measured using the QCL-1000 Chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate
Endpoint Assay Kit (Lonza Walkersville, Inc., Walkersville, MD, U.S.A.) as previously
described [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A standard curve for the endotoxin assay
was prepared using endotoxin-free water with concentrations of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 endotoxin
units (EU)/m<italic>l </italic>(1 EU=0.1 <italic>n</italic>g LPS). The internal recovery rate,
as determined using positively spiked samples, was &gt;80%, and the limit of detection was
0.1

The LPS concentrations of plasma and uterine fluid were 0.94 EU/m<italic>l</italic> and 6.34
EU/m<italic>l</italic>, respectively. Follicular fluid LPS concentration ranged from 0.62
EU/m<italic>l</italic> to 12.40 EU/m<italic>l </italic>(<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
    <p>The concentrations of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) in follicular fluid were measured
by enzyme immunoassay as previously described [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].
Standard curve ranges were 2&#x2013;2,000 <italic>p</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic> for E2 and
50&#x2013;50,000 <italic>p</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic> for P4. Follicular fluid was diluted with
assay buffer when E2 and P4 concentrations were too high for the respective standard curve
ranges. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation averaged 7.7% and 4.9% for E2,
and 6.5% and 8.7% for P4, respectively. The ratio of E2 and P4 concentrations (E/P ratio) in
follicular fluid is shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>
    <p>This is the first report to document the comparison of LPS concentrations in plasma,
follicular fluid and uterine fluid of a clinical case of bovine metritis. The LPS
concentrations in ovarian follicular fluid was similar to that in plasma and was lower than
that in uterine fluid (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Compared to
previous studies [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the LPS concentrations in follicular
fluid and uterine fluid detected in the present case were much lower, although the plasma LPS
concentration was similar to that reported by Mateus <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and Williams <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This discrepancy among studies might be due to the
condition of the animals; the severity of uterine inflammation in the present case might be
rather mild compared to that of cows assessed in previous studies.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, one of seven follicles showed an extremely high level of LPS (12.40
EU/m<italic>l</italic>) compared to other follicles (0.62 to 0.97 EU/m<italic>l</italic>).
No distinctive feature in the follicular size, appearance, vascularization or location was
noted among the seven follicles. The mechanism by which LPS accumulates in the follicular
fluid is not known. Although we currently have no clear explanation for this specific
accumulation of LPS in a single follicle, these results suggest that some specific follicles
might accumulate LPS selectively, passively or by chance. One potential candidate molecule
that could be involved in the accumulation of LPS is LPS-binding protein (LBP). LBP is an
acute-phase protein produced in the liver, which circulates in the bloodstream where it
recognizes and forms a high-affinity complex with LPS [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In humans, LBP is constitutively present in serum and increases by 10- to
50-fold during acute-phase inflammation [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, it
might be possible that LBP produced by the acute uterine inflammation binds to LPS, which
would then contribute to accumulation of LPS in the follicular fluid.</p>
    <p>In general, the E/P ratio can be used to determine the follicular activity in cattle, and
follicles are classified as E2-active (E/P ratio &#x2265;1) or E2-inactive (E/P ratio &lt;1) [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. We recently reported that follicles with a follicular
fluid LPS concentration greater than 0.5 EU/m<italic>l</italic> were classified as
E2-inactive, with suppressed E2 production [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].
Similarly, in the present case, all follicles with a follicular fluid LPS concentration
greater than 0.5 EU/m<italic>l</italic> were classified as E2-inactive, although the E/P ratio
of individual follicles did not correlate with follicular LPS concentration (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Pearson&#x2019;s correlation coefficient= &#x2212;0.17,
<italic>P</italic>=0.73). These findings indicate that follicular steroid production was
suppressed in all follicles of the present case, which is consistent with previous
studies.</p>
    <p>LPS is derived from the cell membranes of gram-negative bacteria, such as <italic>E.
coli</italic>; however, gram-negative bacteria were not detected from the uterus of the
present case. In general, <italic>E. coli</italic> dominates the uterus in the first few days
after parturition, and <italic>E. coli</italic> numbers decrease within 2 weeks postpartum due
to the physiological involution process [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, it
is likely that the cow used in the present study was in a state of spontaneous recovery from
the early postpartum uterine inflammation, and any gram-negative bacteria that had initially
contaminated the uterine rumen had already been eliminated. Indeed, histopathological findings
of the endometrium indicated that the uterine condition was consistent with a transition
period to chronic inflammation. In our previous study, we observed that the follicular LPS
concentration was not associated with the severity of uterine inflammation (unpublished data).
Perhaps, this inconsistency between the uterine condition and follicular LPS concentration
indicates the possibility of long-term accumulation of LPS in follicular fluid after the
uterine inflammation has resolved.</p>
    <p>In summary, various concentrations of LPS were detected in the plasma, follicular fluid and
uterine fluid of a cow with postpartum metritis. Although the concentration of LPS in ovarian
follicular fluid was almost the same as that in plasma and was lower than that in uterine
fluid, one follicle showed an extremely high concentration of LPS. Further studies using more
clinical cases of uterine inflammation are required to examine the possible accumulation of
LPS in follicular fluid.</p>
