      <title>Context</title>
      <p>An unprecedented epidemic of Ebola virus disease has ravaged West Africa since December, 2013 [<xref rid="pntd.0004393.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
      <p>The French nongovernmental organization Alliance for International Medical Action opened the N&#x2019;z&#xE9;r&#xE9;kor&#xE9; Ebola treatment center (ETC) on December 2nd, 2014. This center includes a laboratory managed by the Belgian organization B-Fast/B-Life. Between December 2nd, 2014, and February 7th, 2015, 130 patients were admitted, of whom 76 were confirmed to have Ebola virus disease (EVD), which was fatal in 60.8%.</p>
      <p>Since December 26th, 2014, the N&#x2019;z&#xE9;r&#xE9;kor&#xE9; ETC has been a clinical trial site, participating in a multicenter study to evaluate the ability of a 10-day course of the oral antiviral agent favipiravir to reduce mortality in Ebola-infected adults and children aged over 1 year [<xref rid="pntd.0004393.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>

      <title>Case Presentation</title>
      <p>Our 6-year-old patient was likely infected by his mother, who was admitted to the center with EVD on December 19th, 2014. She died 2 days later. The patient&#x2019;s father was admitted to the center on December 31st and tested positive. He cleared Ebola virus (EBOV) as of January 5th but remained in the ward as long as his child was hospitalized. The patient&#x2019;s aunt has given consent to the publication of this case report.</p>

      <title>Clinical and Biological Status at Baseline, Initial Management</title>
      <p>The child was admitted to the ETC on December 26th, 2014, with isolated fever (38.8&#xB0;C) that lasted for less than 24 hours. Cardiorespiratory parameters were stable. EBOV reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was positive (cycle threshold: 28.4), and blood chemistry values were as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004393.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Oral ciprofloxacin and artemether/lumefantrine combination were administered, as per the center protocol. On day 2, the patient showed lethargy, with decreased oral intake. Intravenous treatment was commenced, and antibiotic and antimalarial medications were changed to ceftriaxone and artesunate. The investigational drug favipiravir was initiated 36 hours post-admission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004393.g001">Fig 1</xref>), with a good feasibility of use. Comprehensive symptomatic treatment was initiated and included paracetamol, ondansetron, and loperamide.</p>

      <title>Subsequent Clinical Course and Biological Features</title>
      <p>Clinical and biological parameters and treatments are detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004393.g001">Fig 1</xref>.</p>
      <p>The patient experienced profuse diarrhea and vomiting on days 5&#x2013;14, accompanied by hypotension, tachycardia, and drowsiness. He was treated for hypovolemia with intravenous fluid. Over these 10 days, 1 to 2 liters of 0.9% sodium chloride or Ringer&#x2019;s lactate solution were administered daily to restore cardiac output and correct renal function. Hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and metabolic acidosis were corrected by intravenous and oral treatments.</p>
      <p>The patient was severely hyponatremic on day 11 (sodium 115 mmol per liter), with an 18% decrease in weight since admission but preserved consciousness.</p>
      <p>Nutritional support included BP100 biscuits, providing potassium and contributing to oral electrolyte supplementation. Urine output measurement was not possible until day 17, when the patient&#x2019;s father assisted with monitoring.</p>
      <p>On day 8, the patient developed oral candidiasis with dysphagia, resolving after 10 days of oral amphotericin B.</p>
      <p>The patient became afebrile on day 7, but fever recurred on day 11, with onset of abdominal pain and diffuse guarding. Ceftriaxone treatment was resumed from day 12 to day 18. His condition deteriorated on day 16. He developed generalized edema and had two tonic-clonic seizures; his temperature was 39.7&#xB0;C. The seizures spontaneously resolved after 2 minutes, without use of benzodiazepines. He was tachypnoeic at 49 breaths per minute, without flaring of the nostrils, grunting, or intercostal muscle recession. Lying flat on his side did not aggravate his dyspnea. Oxygen saturation measurement was unavailable. Neurologic examination showed no focal abnormality or nuchal rigidity.</p>
      <p>A urine dipstick test was negative for protein. A rapid test for <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (SD-Bioline, Standard Diagnostics Inc., Republic of Korea) was negative. Blood tests showed hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and anemia. Intravenous rehydration was ceased, diuretics were not used, and oral potassium supplementation was prescribed as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004393.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Respiratory symptoms improved within hours and edema resolved over 7 days. No further seizures occurred.</p>
      <p>No significant bleeding occurred. The patient experienced slight rectal bleeding on days 7 and 8 and venipuncture site bleeding on day 11. Other symptoms were nonspecific, including prolonged listlessness, headache, cough, conjunctivitis, myalgia, and arthralgia.</p>

      <title>EBOV RT-PCR Assays and Favipiravir Use</title>
      <p>Ebola virus infection was confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Hence, according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions, results are expressed as the &#x201C;cycle threshold&#x201D; (Ct), corresponding to the number of cycles required to cross the threshold positivity value, which is thus inversely correlated with viral load. Between December 2nd, 2014, and January 16th, 2015, the lowest Ct among all patients was 15, with a Ct of 40 corresponding to the limit of viral detection.</p>
      <p>Initial Ct was 28.4, reaching a nadir of 17.7 on day 5. The subsequent increase in Ct, reflecting decrease in viral load, was slow. The threshold of detection was reached on day 17, and EBOV RT-PCR tests were negative from day 20 onwards. Although the favipiravir trial protocol stipulates a 10-day treatment course, it was decided, in agreement with the study investigators, to continue the drug until the Ct corresponded to the upper limit of virus detection (day 14 of treatment, which was day 17 of disease).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec006">
      <title>Cure and Discharge</title>
      <p>Cure was declared on day 22 after 3 afebrile days, and the patient was discharged. Neurologic and respiratory examinations were normal. Laboratory results normalized on day 30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004393.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

      <title>Case Discussion</title>
      <p>We report the survival of a 6-year old boy with complicated EVD. He survived despite his high viral load at admission [<xref rid="pntd.0004393.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, age as a poor prognostic factor is controversial [<xref rid="pntd.0004393.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004393.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The case fatality rate seems very high in children under 5 years of age, but school children and adolescents seem to survive more. Our patient may be at this &#x201C;age threshold.&#x201D;</p>
      <p>Our patient clearly illustrates the clinical course of severe EVD. Indeed, it seems difficult to refer the observed complications to electrolyte disturbances or direct pathogenesis of EBOV [<xref rid="pntd.0004393.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>Viral load was monitored throughout the course of illness. Viral decay kinetics were slower than reported in other patients with EVD [<xref rid="pntd.0004393.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Instead of administering favipiravir for 10 days, as stipulated by the trial protocol [<xref rid="pntd.0004393.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], it was decided to pursue this therapy until the cycle threshold corresponded to the upper limit of virus detection, assuming that this could favor survival. This limit was reached on day 14 of treatment.</p>
      <p>Restoring appropriate fluid and electrolyte balance is one of the keys to survival. We have shown that even in extreme conditions, individualized care with close laboratory monitoring can be provided in a West African ETC.</p>
