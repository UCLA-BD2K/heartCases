      <title>1. INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Mycetoma is a worldwide disease that frequently occurs in the tropics with the highest prevalence being in Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. <italic>Madurella mycetomatis</italic> is the main causative organism of human eumycetoma in Sudan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The site of involvement varies with the casual agent and the geographical distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The disease is characterized by extensive subcutaneous masses, usually with sinuses draining pus and fungal grains. The characteristic triad, of a subcutaneous mass, sinus, and the
presence of discharge containing grains are pathognomonic of
mycetoma. It usually involves the subcutaneous tissue after a
traumatic inoculation of the causative organism. Feet and legs
were usually the sites of the infections, but rare sites were reported too.
Hereby, we presented abdominal wall mycetoma presented as
obstructed incisional hernia of cesarean section in eastern Sudan.</p>

      <title>2. CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 22-year-old lady was presented with an abdominal
swelling&#x2014;around a previous caesarian section scar&#x2014;gradually
increasing in size for one year. In the last 2 days, it became
tense, increased in size, and very painful. There was no vomiting
or abdominal distention and she had normal bowl habits. She had
mild fever but no otherwise significant symptoms. There was no
past history of trauma or thorn prick injury to the site of the
swelling and no other body swellings. She was not known
diabetic or having any other chronic illness.</p>
      <p>On examination, she looked ill but not pale nor emaciated. Her
pulse rate was 100 per minute, her temperature was 38&#xB0;C.
Her abdomen was not distended; there was a subumblical midline
scar. There was a swelling involving the umbilical region and
encroaching the hypogastrium about 5 &#xD7; 8 cm, the swelling
was tense, and did not increase in size with coughing, skin over
it was normal. It was tense, tender, hot, firm in consistency, and
nonreducible. There was no organomegaly and bowl sounds were heard
normal.</p>
      <p>A provisional diagnosis of obstructed incisional hernia containing
an omentocele was put and the patient was prepared for surgery.
Her hemoglobin was 10.5 g/dl, her urine was clear, and her
renal and liver function tests were within normal range.</p>
      <p>There was no peritoneal sac identified intraoperatively; instead a
nodulated mass which involved the anterior and posterior walls of
the rectus sheath together with the rectus abdominis muscle. The
peritoneum was intact. On dissecting the mass, pus was found
trickling from cavities containing black grains. The mass was
excised with a margin of safety, the field was soaked with iodine
tincture 2%, and the rent was closed. The patient was put on
ketoconazole tablets 400 mg/d for 6 months to be followed in
the referred clinic.</p>
      <p>Histopathological examination revealed macroscopically 4 masses of
soft tissue measuring 1, 2, 4.5, and 4 cm. Microscopic
sections showed grains of <italic>Madurella mycetomatis</italic>,
surrounded by heavy neutrophilic inflammatory cells (type 1
reaction).</p>

      <title>3. DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Mycetoma has been a disease of major concern during the last few
decades, in areas where it is endemic. Its importance came from
being a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The disease
is supposed to originate from traumatic inoculation of plant
material or soil contaminated by these fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It has a male predominance, commonly affecting adults between 20&#x2013;40 years
of age and these are the earning members of the society especially
in developing countries. The commonest site for mycetoma is the
foot, the hand is the second commonest site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, rare sites such as the chest, abdominal walls, fascial bones,
mandible, paranasal sinuses, eyelid, vulva, orbit, scrotum, and
surgical incisions may be affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Primary actinomycosis of the anterior abdominal wall is rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this case, the course of transmission of the organism is
questionable and difficult to predict. It could be an iatrogenic
cause resulting from peroperative introduction of the organism
into the tissues. As it could be the result of pre- or
postoperative inoculation although the patient has no history
of any trauma to the region of the swelling. Yet, it remains to be
elucidated in view with other cases reported in likewise parts of the body.</p>
