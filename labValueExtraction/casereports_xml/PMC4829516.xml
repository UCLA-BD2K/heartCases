        <p>2.3-month-old (Case 1), one-month-old (Case 2) and 6-month-old (Case 3), Japanese Black
calves presented with mild to severe wheezing. All calves had histories of dystocia at
birth with breech presentation. Physical examination, thoracic radiography, endoscopy or
computed tomography indicated wheezing associated with tracheal collapse and stenosis
caused by perinatal rib fractures. Partial resection of the fractured first and second
ribs was performed on all calves. The respiration in Cases 1 and 2 immediately improved
after the surgery, while Case 3 required two weeks to improve. Cases 1 and 3 grew up
healthy and were sold at auction, but Case 2 had a recurrence of wheezing at three months
post-discharge and showed growth retarding. Partial costectomy may be an effective
solution for control of respiration, however, further cases are required to discuss the
criteria for surgical management and to obtain favorable postoperative prognosis in calves
with tracheal collapse and stenosis caused by perinatal rib fractures.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Rib fractures have been known to occur in calves during delivery, sometimes causing perinatal
death [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although pathogenesis has been unclear,
fractures are suspected to be related to dystocia at birth, especially with breech
presentation or excessive traction [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The most involved bones are cranial pairs [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], but
multiple rib fractures can be also produced [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As a
result of the fracture and following callus formation, the trachea at the thoracic inlet
becomes collapsed and stenotic [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Clinical signs in previous reports have included wheezing, cough,
dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, exercise intolerance and growth retarding [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
    <p>Supportive treatments and tracheotomy are not effective in this disorder [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although treatments are not necessary in some calves
with fractures, almost all calves with this respiratory problem require surgical intervention
to improve the condition [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Extra- or intra-luminal stent therapies for tracheal collapse have
been well known in canine patients [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In farm
animals with the condition, hand-made extra-luminal prosthesis, open-ended coil spring or made
from polypropylene syringe, has been also applied for surgical correction [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Calves with
the disease caused by rib fractures have also received the surgery [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], but prognosis has been relatively poor [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, the prosthesis requires removal
after a few months post-correction, because it becomes unsuitable to the trachea size due to
growth of the calf [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
    <p>The authors encountered three calves with mild to severe wheezing caused by rib fractures;
partial costectomy provided successful management of the respiration. This paper describes the
clinical findings of three Japanese Black calves with stridor caused by perinatal rib fracture
that were treated with partial costectomy.</p>
    <p><italic>Case 1</italic>: A 2.3-month-old, male, Japanese Black calf, weighing 85 kg,
presented with dyspnea after excitement and exercise. This calf had been delivered by forced
extraction, because of excessively fetus and breech presentation. The calf had no respiratory
signs at rest, but showed respiratory rate 60 breath / min at excite. Physical examination
revealed the left side of the chest wall depressed towards the thoracic cavity and a roll
sound at the cervical trachea, which was strongest in the thoracic inlet region. In this case,
radiographies showed tracheal collapse and stenosis at the posterior cervix (C6) to thoracic
inlet region (T1), approximately 10 cm in width forward of cranial edge of the first rib and
marks of cranial rib fractures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Radiophotograph of Case 1, showing tracheal collapse and stenosis at posterior cervix
to cranial thoracic inlet (arrowheads) and marks of fractures in a few ribs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-78-451-g001"/></fig>). There were no findings of pneumonia. Following xylazine (Bayer, Tokyo, Japan)
sedation (0.2 mg/kg, IV) and insertion of a tracheal tube, computed tomography (CT) (Toshiba
Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan) was performed under general anesthesia of isoflurane (DS
Pharma Animal Health, Osaka, Japan) with oxygen. The results demonstrated the marks of
fractures of the left first to third ribs and right first and second ribs, and the left
cranial two pairs encroached on the thoracic cavity. In addition, three-dimensional
reconstruction images of CT also recognized tracheal collapse and stenosis at the sixth
cervical to first thoracic vertebrae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig.
2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Three-dimensional reconstruction image of CT in Case 1, showing tracheal collapse and
stenosis at the sixth cervical to first thoracic vertebrae (left lateral view after
removal of left scapular, forelimb and ribs). Fractured marks are also recognized in the
right first (R1) and second (R2) ribs. C6: sixth cervical vertebra, C7: seventh cervical
vertebra, T1: first thoracic vertebra.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-78-451-g002"/></fig>). On the basis of these clinical findings, respiratory sign in this calf was diagnosed
as being caused by tracheal collapse and stenosis resulting from rib fractures. Resection of
the marked, deformed, left first and second ribs was performed in this case. The calf was
anesthetized, following the same procedures as for the CT examination. The calf was positioned
at the right lateral recumbency with lifting up the left forelimb, and the left first and
second ribs were approached through the axillary area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig.
3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Position at surgery in Case 1, showing right lateral recumbency with left forelimb
lifted for axillary approach to the left first and second ribs. A skin incision was made
along the white dotted line.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-78-451-g003"/></fig>). After skin incision, the superficial and deep pectoral muscles were cut. The first
and second deformed ribs were immediately palpable, and connective tissue was bluntly
dissected. Partial costectomy was performed in the deformed parts of the ribs by using an
electrical saw. Following the costectomy, the muscles were sutured to close the defect in the
thoracic wall, and the surgery was finished. The surgery time was approximately 3.5 hr. There
were no peri- and post-operative complications in this case. Respiratory sign did not develop
after excitement and exercise, postoperatively. Enrofloxacin (Bayer, 5 mg/kg, SC) and flunixin
meglumine (Intervet K.K., Tokyo, Japan, 2 mg/kg, IV) were administered for six days and for
three days, respectively. The calf was discharged six days post-operation. Radiography
confirmed no problems of the tracheal airway 41 days after the surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_004" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Radiophotograph of Case 1, showing no troubles in tracheal air way 41 days after
partial costectomy.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-78-451-g004"/></fig>). Thereafter, the calf grew up healthy and was sold at auction.</p>
    <p><italic>Case 2</italic>: A one-month-old, male, Japanese Black calf, weighing 65 kg,
presented with wheezing and dyspnea. This case also had a history of dystocia, as a result of
the caudal presentation and an adipose lump at the pelvic cranial part of the mother. Sixteen
days after birth, the calf developed a fever and decreased suckling. Antibiotics
administration resolved the fever, but wheezing and labored breathing persisted. At the first
presentation in our university, the calf showed prominent wheezing and abdominal breathing
indicating dyspnea at rest. Auscultation revealed no abnormalities in the heart and lungs.
Palpation detected decompression of the right chest wall. Radiographies of the cervix and
thorax demonstrated marks of multiple rib fractures and severe tracheal collapse and stenosis
at the caudal cervix (C7) to thoracic inlet region (T1), approximately 9 cm in width forward
of cranial edge of the first rib. In this case, the tracheal lesion was more severe than in
Case 1. There were also no findings of pneumonia. In this case, endoscopic observation
(OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan) of the trachea was performed with xylazine (Bayer) sedation (0.2
mg/kg, IV), and tracheal stenosis was observed in the lumen because of the perforated dorsal
wall of the trachea at the cervical area. In this calf, partial resection of the fractured
ribs was also performed in the right first and second ribs, similar to procedures with Case 1.
After removal, the stenosis lesion of the trachea was visibly dilated by the cuff of the tube.
A drain was placed in the thorax, and the chest wall was closed. The surgery time was
approximately 3 hr. There were no troubles observed from the anesthesia. The respiratory
distress in this calf was dramatically improved the next day, despite insufficient expansion
of the tracheal airway in radiographies. Although knuckling of the right forelimb indicating
radial nerve paralysis had developed, paralysis resolved one week later. Postoperative
medication including enrofloxacin (Bayer, 5 mg/kg, SC) for nine days and flunixin meglumine
(Intervet K.K., 2 mg/kg, IV) for four days was administered. Suckling and activity recovered,
and the calf discharged at day nine post-operation. Thereafter, the calf had a favored course
with good condition. However, the calf showed growth retarding compared to calves of similar
age at the farm, and wheezing recurred three months after discharge. Therefore, the calf went
to slaughter.</p>
    <p><italic>Case 3</italic>: A six-month-old, castrated male, Japanese Black calf, weighing 201
kg, presented with mild wheezing after excitement and feeding. This calf also had been
delivered by forced extraction because of dystocia caused by a posterior presentation, and the
animal immediately showed dyspnea at birth. Supportive treatments including fluid therapy and
steroid and antibiotics injections were performed, but wheezing did not completely diminish.
The suspected cause of wheezing was perinatal rib fracture, and the owner eagerly wanted us to
deaden or reduce it to allow the calf to be sold at auction. Respiratory sign was uncertain at
rest, but auscultation suggested that a roll sound was maximum at the thoracic inlet. Cervical
palpation induced coughing. The right thoracic wall in the axillary area was slightly
decompressed, and the severity was less than in Cases 1 and 2. There were no abnormal findings
in the lung and heart sound. On the basis of these findings, this case was also tentatively
diagnosed with tracheal collapse and stenosis due to cranial rib fractures. CT (Toshiba)
examination was performed under general anesthesia, the same as with Case 1. CT images
demonstrated that the right first and second ribs were deformed and slightly encroached upon
the thoracic cavity, and the trachea was collapsed and stenotic at sixth to seventh cervical
vertebrae. Partial costectomy of the right first and second ribs was performed with a
different approach from those in Cases 1 and 2. The calf was positioned in left lateral
recumbency, and the right forelimb was taken in tow backward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_005">Fig. 5</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_005" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>Position at surgery in Case 3, showing left lateral recumbency and caudal traction of
the right forelimb for approach to the right first and second ribs via the cranial part
of the scapula and shoulder joint. A skin incision was made along the white dotted
line.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-78-451-g005"/></fig>). A skin incision was made at the cranial line of the scapula and the scapular joint.
The ribs were approached and palpable after medial incision of the brachiocephalic muscle.
With careful manipulation of the brachial plexus, the scalenus dorsalis muscle and surrounding
connective tissues were separated to make the ribs visible. The axillary artery was injured
from this procedure, resulting in severe hemorrhage. Although extensive time was required for
hemostasis, it was successfully done. Fractured ribs with deformity were confirmed by
palpation, and the deformed parts were partially resected with an electrical saw. After rib
removal, the muscles were sutured to cover the defect, and surgery was finished. The surgery
time was approximately 4.5 hr. The next day, knuckling in both forelimbs indicating radial
nerve paralysis had developed, but paralysis of the left side improved one week
post-operation. However, the surgery side required approximately three weeks for improvement.
Antibiotics, benzyl-penicillin procaine/dihydrostreptomycin sulfate solution (Meiji Seika
Pharma Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, 10,000 U/kg, 12.5 mg/kg, IM) or enrofloxacin (Bayer, 5 mg/kg,
SC), were administered for twelve days post-surgery. Wheezing did not improve immediately, but
diminished gradually within two weeks. The calf discharged 22 days after surgery and had no
problems with gait or wheezing on the farm. Thereafter, the calf grew normally and went up for
auction.</p>
    <p>In this report, all three calves with stridor were improved by partial costectomy, and it
indicated the respiratory disorder was related to perinatal rib fractures leading to tracheal
airway abnormality. However, Case 2 had recurrent wheezing three months post-operation and
retarded growth for unknown reasons.</p>
    <p>Previous reports regard tracheal collapse and stenosis in calves as a congenital disease or
traumatic malformation [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the major etiology of the condition is associated with rib fractures
[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Diagnosis of this disease due to rib fracture requires
a history of dystocia at birth with breech position or forced extraction, verified through
physical examination, radiography and endoscopy [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This respiratory condition is similar to those
of other upper or lower airway diseases, and clinicians may misdiagnose affected calves with
bronchopneumonia and necrotic laryngitis if they do not know of the disease [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Palpation may detect imbalance of the right and left
thoracic walls at the axillary part and rib deformities by callus formation [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A thrill of
the stridor at the cervical trachea was also palpable in our calves. In addition, auscultation
would be useful in the diagnosis [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In Cases 1 and 3, an abnormal respiratory sound was
auscultated at the cervical trachea with maximum volume at the thoracic inlet, even when they
were asymptomatic at rest. Definitive diagnosis depends on radiographies in calves with marks
of rib fractures and tracheal collapse and stenosis [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In Cases 1 and 2, radiographical
examination was performed, and the results also showed evidence of several rib fractures and
tracheal collapse and stenosis. In Case 3, radiographical changes were estimated to be
uncertain, and examination was not performed. CT examinations were performed in Cases 1 and 3,
and the findings, especially three-dimensional reconstruction images, were suitable to
evaluate the severity of rib fractures and tracheal lesion and to schedule surgical
strategies. Although the use would be limited in bovine clinic, CT examination should be
included in the diagnostic option of the disease in calves. Endoscopy can also observe
tracheal collapse and stenosis from the inside. Upon examination, the perforated dorsal wall
of the cervical trachea could be observed in Case 2. However, endoscopy may not be always
useful for diagnosis [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
    <p>In calves with tracheal collapse and stenosis due to rib fracture, prostheses have been
utilized in surgical management [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the
present cases, partial resection of deformed ribs led to improvement of stridor. Our result
suggests that prostheses are not always necessary for treatments of tracheal collapse and
stenosis by perinatal rib fractures in calves. The improvement of wheezing required two weeks
in Case 3, but immediately recovered in Cases 1 and 2 after surgery. The improvement of
respiration after the surgery may depend on the duration of involvement, because Case 3
received surgery at six months of age.</p>
    <p>Two approach methods for the first and second ribs were tried in our calves. In Cases 1 and
2, the ribs were approached via the axillary area. On the other hand, in Case 3, the ribs were
explored via the cranial area of the scapula and the joint with posterior extraction of the
forelimb. Careful approach and resection of the ribs were required in both methods, because
the brachial plexus and axillary artery are present around the first rib [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In Cases 2 and 3, radial nerve paralysis developed as a
post-operative complication. Although there have been no reports describing the complication,
our experiences advise more careful approach and manipulation for resection of first and
second ribs. In addition, in Case 3, the axillary artery was injured when muscle and
connective tissue around the first rib was dissected. The axillary approach may be less risky
for arterial damage.</p>
    <p>The periosteum of ribs in healthy calves can be exfoliated from the bones, and partial
costectomy can be performed without incision of the pleura and exposing the thoracic cavity
[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the periosteum adheres with bones or
callus in calves with rib fractures, and the ribs must be resected with the pleura. Although
the calves fell into the condition of thoracotomy immediately following the costectomy, there
were no complications from routine anesthesia techniques.</p>
    <p>The prognosis in previous reports has been unfavorable in the involved calves with surgical
treatments, and the growth of the calves relatively retarded [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Cases 1 and 3 had no sign of trouble
from their conditions post-surgery through auction time at their farms. On the contrary, Case
2 returned to the preoperative condition three months post-surgery and showed growth
retarding. Preoperative conditions including the severity of rib fractures and respiratory
signs, and the durations of the disease, may influence postoperative performances of involved
calves treated with partial costectomy. In such case, re-evaluation of the tracheal condition
and rib fractures by radiography and CT and additional costectomy and/or tracheal expansion
with utilization of prosthesis should be considered. The prosthesis would be suitable to make
of flexible and substantial materials to adapt the tracheal size of growing calves, because
previous reports describe recurrence of respiratory distress caused by luminal narrowing of
trachea in calves treated with using extra-tracheal prosthesis of polypropylene plastic
syringe [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
    <p>At present, authors consider that partial costectomy may be an effective treatment for calves
with wheezing associated with tracheal collapse and stenosis due to perinatal rib fractures,
except for severe cases. Additional cases with various severities of the disorder would be
required to discuss the surgical criteria and determine how best to achieve a favorable
prognosis for the calves.</p>
