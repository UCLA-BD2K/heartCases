        <p>An 11-year-old cat with a 4-month history of lethargy, inappetence, dysphagia, partial
mandibular paralysis and weight loss, was euthanized due to the rapid deterioration of his
condition. Post-mortem radiographic examination revealed severe bone lysis of the left
zygomatic arch, temporal and parietal bones. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed
a large isointense mass of the left side of the skull associated with extensive lysis of
the parietal and temporal bones and destruction of the adjacent tympanic bulla. Gross and
histological examinations revealed a pulmonary adenosquamous carcinoma of the left lung,
with metastases to the spleen, liver, mesenteric lymph nodes, mesentery, diaphragm,
abdominal aorta, left orbit and calvaria. No limb or digit metastases were detected.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Primary lung tumors are rare in cats and occur as a sporadic disease in geriatric animals,
with the average age at diagnosis ranging from 12 to 13 years and no breed or sex
predilections [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. An accurate and early diagnosis is
often essential due to the poor prognosis in case of pulmonary neoplasm; however, cats
affected by pulmonary tumors often have nonspecific clinical signs, and diagnosis can be
difficult [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The present report describes an unusual
metastatic pattern of primary pulmonary adenosquamous carcinoma in a cat presented for
exophthalmos and swelling of the left side of the head, without premonitory respiratory
signs.</p>
    <p>An 11-year-old male, neutered, European shorthair cat was submitted for a full postmortem
examination. The cat had a 4-month history of lethargy, inappetence, dysphagia, partial
mandibular paralysis and weight loss. The referring veterinarians detected severe anorexia,
moderate splenomegaly, left monolateral exophthalmos and swelling of the left side of the
head. Due to the rapid deterioration of the cat&#x2019;s condition, the owner elected euthanasia, and
a postmortem examination was conducted.</p>
    <p>The body condition of the animal was extremely poor; external examination revealed massive
swelling of the left region of the skull associated with moderate exophthalmos of the left
globe and left deviation of the jaw associated to ankylosis of the temporomandibular
joints.</p>
    <p>Postmortem radiographic examination revealed severe permeative lysis characterized by
coalescing regions of ill-defined bone destruction involving the left zygomatic arch, temporal
and parietal bones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>T1- (A and C) and T2-weighted (B and D) transverse and dorsal images of the post-mortem
MRI of the head showing a large isointense mass of the left side of skull associated
with extensive lysis of the parietal and temporal bones and destruction of the adjacent
tympanic bulla. There appears to be a slight mass effect with a right midline brain
shift and diffuse hyperintensity of the tissue close to the outside of the mass.
Radiographic examinations (E and F) revealed severe bone lysis of the left zygomatic
arch, temporal and parietal bones.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-479-g001"/></fig>). Postmortem magnetic resonance examination (MRI) of the head showed the presence of a
large T1- and T2-weighted isointense mass on the left side of the skull, which was associated
with mild right brain shift, severe lysis of the calvarium and destruction of the ipsilateral
tympanic bulla and temporomandibular joint. On T2-weighted images, the tissue close to the
outside of the mass showed marked hyperintensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.
1</xref>).</p>
    <p>Gross examination of the thoracic cavity showed a severe deformation of the left lung that
was completely compressed and effaced by a large multilobulated, poorly demarcated,
whitish-tan, firm mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>(A) Note that on the left side, the left lung is completely effaced by a large
multilobulated whitish-tan mass. On the right side, the right lung is characterized by
severe edema, atelectasis and hyperemia. (B) The skull is characterized by massive
swelling of the left region of the calvaria, with a large mass involved the left
parietal and temporal bones and the left temporomandibular joint (C).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-479-g002"/></fig>). The right lung was affected by severe diffuse atelectasis, resulting from the massive
compression and severe congestion. Regional lymph nodes were severely enlarged. Moderate right
ventricle hypertrophy was also detected.</p>
    <p>In the abdominal cavity, multiple, small, whitish masses were detected in the spleen,
mesenteric lymph nodes and on the abdominal side of the diaphragm.</p>
    <p>Gross examination of the skull revealed that the left side of the brain was severely
compressed by a firm, expansile, multilobulated mass attached to the calvarium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The mass involved the left parietal and
temporal bones and the left temporomandibular joint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig.
2C</xref>). The mass was extremely firm, with gritty areas; the cut surface was white with
whitish areas of mineralization. The brain was characterized by a severe asymmetry of the
cerebral hemispheres due to compression by the mass. No abnormalities were noted in the limbs
or digits.</p>
    <p>Specimens from formalin-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin for histological examination.</p>
    <p>Histological examination revealed that the left pulmonary parenchyma was completely effaced
and substituted by a densely cellular, unencapsulated, poorly demarcated, infiltrative
neoplasm. The neoplasm was composed of polygonal cells often arranged in pluristratified
islands, with multifocal progressive central keratinization, or arranged in small tubules
supported by a moderate amount of fibrous stroma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig.
3A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Histological findings of the left lung (A, B), optic nerve (C, D) and calvarium (E, F).
A: Histological examination of the left lung compressed by an epithelial
neoplasm composed of polygonal cells arranged in pluristratified islands, with
multifocal keratinization, or arranged in small tubules. B: Details of the neoplastic
epithelium; tubules were lined with pseudostratified cuboidal to columnar, often
ciliated, cells (arrow). C: Histological examination of the left retrobulbar and orbital
soft tissues. The optic nerve is infiltrated by columnar epithelial cells arranged in
tubular structures (arrow). Other tubular structures are present at the periphery of the
optic nerve. D: Details of the neoplastic epithelium; a portion of the optic nerve is
visible in the upper-left corner. Tubules were lined with pseudostratified cuboidal to
columnar, often ciliated, cells. E: Histological examination of the calvarium; a
multifocal epithelial neoplasm composed of islands and tubules expanded and effaced the
normal bone architecture. F: Details of the neoplastic epithelium; irregular osteolytic
bone trabeculae (arrows) are surrounded by islands of neoplastic cells, often
characterized by progressive keratinization.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-479-g003"/></fig>). Neoplastic cells were cuboidal to columnar, often ciliated, with indistinct cell
borders, a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm, a round to oval central nucleus, a
marginated chromatin and one evident magenta nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Anisocytosis and anisokaryosis were severe, and mitoses ranged between 2
and 3 per HPF. Multifocal areas of necrosis and mineralization were present. The apical lobe
of the left lung was characterized by diffuse hemorrhages, necrosis and numerous macrophages
filled with brown pigment (hemosiderin). The right lung was characterized by diffuse and
severe edema, hyperemia and atelectasis, due to the compressive effect of the contralateral
mass.</p>
    <p>Other nodules, composed of the same neoplastic cells, were detected on the abdominal side of
the diaphragm and on the liver, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, mesentery and abdominal aorta.
The tumors in all these organs were histologically similar to the primary tumor, but showed a
more extensive scirrhous reaction and multifocal necrotic foci. Neoplastic emboli were also
detected on small vessels of the brain (mainly meningeal vessels). No metastases were present
in the limbs and digits.</p>
    <p>Metastases of the pulmonary adenosquamous carcinoma were also observed on the left
retrobulbar and orbital soft tissues (muscles and adipose tissues), surrounding and
infiltrating the optic nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3C and 3D</xref>). Most
of the choroidal vessels were filled with neoplastic emboli.</p>
    <p>The normal architecture of the calvarium was completely effaced by an infiltrative epithelial
neoplasm with aspects similar to a pulmonary mass. Bone was characterized by extensive
remodeling, bone lysis and new bone and cartilage formation. The epithelial neoplasm was
composed of islands, nests and tubules with direct contact to irregular bone trabeculae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3E and 3F</xref>) with scalloped borders and large
multinucleated osteoclasts in resorption pits on the bone surface (bone resorption). Abundant
fibrous reactions and areas of immature cartilage were present surrounding islands and tubules
(desmoplasia). Areas of necrosis and mineralization were also detected.</p>
    <p>A diagnosis of primary pulmonary adenosquamous carcinoma of the left lung, with metastases to
the spleen, liver, mesenteric lymph nodes, mesentery, diaphragm, abdominal aorta, left orbit
and calvaria, was made.</p>
    <p>Compared with the case in humans, primary pulmonary neoplasms are an infrequent finding in
domestic animals, and most lung tumors are metastatic [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The most commonly reported primary lung neoplasms are of epithelial origin, and
most of them are malignant [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The most common type
of pulmonary neoplasm in cats is adenocarcinoma, while squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous
cell carcinoma, sarcoma and benign tumors are less common [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Non-respiratory clinical signs, such
as weight loss, weakness, lethargy, vomiting and lameness, are, in many cases, the first
complaint of the owner and may precede dyspnea, tachypnea or cough [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This late appearance of
respiratory signs, in the course of the disease makes early diagnosis difficult, and the
diagnosis is often made at necropsy.</p>
    <p>The association between lameness and pulmonary carcinoma, or &#x201C;lung-digit syndrome&#x201D;, is well
known, and it may be related to the angioinvasive properties of pulmonary carcinomas and high
digital blood flow [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Occasionally, feline pulmonary carcinoma can metastasize to other sites, such as
the skin [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>],
eye [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], skeletal muscle [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and long bone [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], as well as more common
sites of metastases, such as the liver and spleen [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].
Few reports of bone metastasis in cats aside from that in the digits are described in the
literature [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Recent studies have reported cases of
pulmonary carcinoma with uncommon metastasis to the bone, such as metastatic spread to the
ulna [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and to the ribs [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
    <p>The present case showed an unusual metastatic pattern, with widespread metastases without
digit involvement. Often lung carcinomas are diagnosed after an animal has been presented for
lameness, and this is often the only complaint [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].
Single or multiple digits (especially the weight-bearing ones) of 1 or more limbs may be
affected, with classical osteolysis of the third phalanx, sometimes with invasion of the
intra-articular space [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the present case, no
lameness was reported in the cat history, and no metastases were observed in the limbs or
digits. Despite the frequency of metastases and widespread involvement in feline pulmonary
carcinoma, calvarium and orbital metastasis are uncommon. Intraocular metastasis has been
described in a cat with pulmonary carcinoma [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but in
the present case, in addition to numerous neoplastic emboli in the choroidal vessels,
metastases of the pulmonary adenosquamous carcinoma were also observed in the retrobulbar and
orbital soft tissues, surrounding and infiltrating the optic nerve, extremely uncommon
features in cats.</p>
    <p>Metastasis of primary pulmonary carcinoma should be included among differential diagnoses in
cases of swelling of the skull or exophthalmos in aged cats. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first report of primary pulmonary adenosquamous carcinoma with calvaria, orbital
and widespread metastasis in a cat. Moreover, in the present case, no metastasis was present
in the limbs and digits, although the association between lameness and pulmonary carcinoma is
the best known metastatic pattern in cats.</p>
