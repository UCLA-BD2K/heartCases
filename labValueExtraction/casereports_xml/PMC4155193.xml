        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>A 9-month-old intact female
Yorkshire terrier dog was presented with episodic partial seizure-like cramping of the
limbs. The patient&#x2019;s episodes began six months previously; the interval between episodes
became shorter, and the duration of the episodes increased. Various tests including
neurologic examination, blood examination, abdominal radiography, ultrasonographic
examination, angiographic computed tomography (CT) and brain magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) detected no remarkable changes. After these tests were conducted, the patient&#x2019;s
condition was suspected to be canine epileptoid cramping syndrome (CECS), which could be a
form of paroxysmal dyskinesia (PD), and as a trial therapy, Science Diet k/d (Hill&#x2019;s Pet
Nutrition, Topeka, KS, U.S.A.) was prescribed. The clinical signs were dramatically
reduced after diet therapy, and we diagnosed the patient with CECS. This is the first case
report of CECS in a Yorkshire terrier dog.</p>

    <p>Muscle cramps are briefly prolonged, involuntary, forceful and painful muscle contractions
lasting from seconds to mins [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] that could be accompanied by palpable knotting of muscle with abnormal
bending of the affected joint [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Cramps are
associated with high rates of repetitive firing of motor units in a muscle and produce action
potentials of nerve terminals; only a few muscle fibers are involved during cramping, while
many fiber bundles are involved in voluntary muscle contraction [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This electronic activity has
been referred to as &#x201C;cramp discharge&#x201D; [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Most cramps
occur in patients with hyperactivity of the peripheral nerve terminals or central nervous
system (CNS) rather than in patients with primary muscle disease in dogs [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Lower motor neuron disorders (peripheral neuropathies,
nerve root compression, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and polio), electrolyte and fluid
abnormalities (hepatic cirrhosis, hemodialysis and high ambient temperatures) and metabolic
disorders (pregnancy, hypothyroidism, hypoadrenocorticism and diabetes mellitus) are commonly
reported as causes of muscle cramping in human medicine [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In veterinary medicine, muscle cramping most likely occurs with the same
features and clinical signs as those described in human medicine, but the animal cannot
complain of painful muscle cramps; therefore, it has rarely been documented as a presenting
clinical sign [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
    <p>Hypertonicity syndromes characterized by clinically, sudden and reversible episodes of limb
hypertonicity, possible cramping, and, in some cases, muscle rippling have been observed
[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This hypertonicity syndrome was first observed
in young Scottish terriers and was called &#x201C;Scottie cramps&#x201D; [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Previous studies showed similar clinical signs in Cavalier King Charles
spaniels, springer spaniels and wheateon terriers [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The
term &#x201C;canine epileptoid cramping syndrome&#x201D; (CECS) was first used for Border terriers in 2012
and is characterized by a paroxysmal cramping or hypertonicity syndrome [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Still, few cases have been
reported in veterinary medicine, and CECS is currently being researched [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of a
Yorkshire terrier that showed the same spectrum of clinical signs described in CECS.</p>
    <p>A 9-month-old intact female Yorkshire terrier dog, weighing 2.5 kg, presented with episodic
partial seizure-like cramping of the limbs. The patient&#x2019;s history revealed that these episodes
began six months previously. The interval between episodes became shorter, and the duration of
the episodes decreased. The patient showed clinical signs four times a day, and the duration
of each episode was slightly over 30 min just before visiting the clinic. Partial seizure was
suspected based on the clinical signs at first presentation. However, all characteristics
including gait were normal between episodes, and the dog was conscious and responsive to the
owners during the episodes. The patient&#x2019;s muscle tone was hypertonic, and showed sustained and
painful involuntary contractions with bending of the affected joint. The general features of
the episodes were similar to those of cramping syndrome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Clinical appearance of episodes (A, B and C).

    <p>On physical examination, the patient&#x2019;s body condition score (BCS) was 5 out of 9. No
remarkable signs were observed. The results of a complete blood count (CBC), serum
biochemistry and electrolyte analysis were within normal ranges, and the patient&#x2019;s pre- and
postprandial bile acid concentrations were normal (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

were found in abdominal radiographic and ultrasonographic examinations. To rule out other
diseases, such as brain disease and portal vasculature abnormality, angiographic computed

portosystemic shunt or brain disease was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Figs.

as a trial therapy, Science Diet k/d (Hill&#x2019;s Pet Nutrition, Topeka, KS, U.S.A.) was
prescribed. The clinical signs were dramatically reduced after diet therapy, and no recurrence
has been observed until the present time (13 months). After the trial diet therapy, we
diagnosed the patient with CECS.</p>
    <p>A paroxysmal cramping or hypertonicity syndrome in Border terriers has recently been
recognized as a condition known as canine epileptoid cramping syndrome (CECS, also known as
Spike&#x2019;s disease) [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Paroxysmal dyskinesias are a group of
movement disorders in human medicine [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This group is
characterized by involuntary movement and sudden occurrence with normal motor function and no
neurologic deficits between episodes [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. CECS or
Spike&#x2019;s disease in Border terrier has been reported over the last 10 years and suspected to be
a breed-related paroxysmal dyskinesia [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Signs shown
by affected individuals are very diverse. Gait abnormalities ranging from ataxia to inability
to stand result from muscle hypertonicity that may be apparent in the mounding of muscles over
the back and limb rigidity [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Affected dogs may fall over and remain recumbent. In severe cases,
cramping of the intestinal muscles may occur and can be detected based on audible borborygmi
and abdominal pain [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. All characteristics, including
gait, are normal between episodes. Unlike during seizure, dogs are conscious and responsive to
owners [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].
The age of onset is usually 2 to 6 years, but is sometimes as early as 4 months of age [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In most
cases, an episode lasts from a few sec to several min and is self-limiting, but an episode
could last significantly longer [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Some dogs may experience only one or 2 episodes during
their lives, while others have episodes throughout their lives with the frequency of episodes
varying from daily to monthly [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This variety of
patterns of frequency suggest that CECS waxes and wanes [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Similar to hypertonicity disorders, CECS can be controlled with diazepam, but
diet therapy with a low-protein food, such as Science Diet k/d or a hypoallergenic diet, can
be an effective treatment option [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As a possible
cause of CECS, metabolic disease and hepatic microvascular dysplasia have been suspected, but
it is mainly thought to be hereditary [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore,
genetic research to identify a marker for CECS is underway [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In a previous study, a canine BCAN microdeletion was found as a genetic problem
related to episodic falling syndrome (EFS), which is a canine paroxysmal hypertonicity
disorder found in Cavalier King Charles spaniels [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In
the case of metabolic myopathies, electrically silent muscle cramps may occur with strenuous
or ischemic exercise due to a lack of glycolysis or glycogenolysis [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Physiological cramps are a common condition in normal individuals
after voluntary contractions or during sleep or rest and can be relieved by passive muscle
stretching and local massage [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In fact, some affected patients show elevated bile acid levels, which
indicates the possibility of hepatic microvascular dysplasia as an underlying disease [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although no specific findings were observed on
computed tomographic images of the portal vasculature in this case, liver biopsy or
scientigraphy will be needed to rule out microvascular dysplasia completely. However, in the
current case, the patient showed normal liver panels including bile acid levels, so a liver
biopsy was not performed. In this case, partial seizure was suspected based on the clinical
signs at the first physical examination. However, the features of seizure activity were not
typical. According to Black <italic>et al</italic>., paroxysmal dyskinesia is distinguished
from partial seizure by movement observation, duration of episode, absence of urination or
defecation and hypersalivation [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In this case, the
patient did not show urination, defecation or hypersalivation. In the case of seizure
activity, autonomic signs could be observed [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The
patient was conscious during episodes and did not show postictal behavior. In the case of
partial seizure, seizure activity could be recorded on ictal EEG, and this would aid in
distinguishing between seizure and cramping [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].
However, we could not perform an EEG examination in this case due to a lack of equipment. In
this case, we could not find any evidence of pre-ictal, ictal or post-ictal phase activity,
such as barking, hypersalivation and restless. The episodes started without any warning. After
the episodes, the patient was totally normal. During the episodes, the patient&#x2019;s muscle tone
was hypertonic with lumbar and limb muscle contractions and showed sustained and involuntary
contractions with bending of the left elbow and knee joint. The general features of the
episodes were similar to those of cramping syndrome. Because animals cannot complain of
painful muscle cramps, we cannot know whether the episodes were accompanied by pain, which
makes it difficult for veterinary medicine clinicians to recognize cramps. Accompanying
clinical signs, such as anorexia after episodes and increased abdominal borborygmi sounds, may
imply that intestinal muscle cramping occurred.</p>
    <p>Channelopathies are ion-channel abnormalities in human medicine, and periodic paralyses were
found on distal exercise muscles asymmetrically [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].
Hypokalemic periodic paralysis, which is one of the channelopathies, was brought on by a
period of exercise followed by rest or carbohydrate loading, and a carbohydrate meal on the
previous evening could make it worse in the early morning on the next day [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, a change in diet change can be helpful in
management of channelopathies [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The periodic
paralyses and change in diet are similar to those in our case, but channelopathies are
accompanied by muscle weakness. Our patient did not show muscle weakness, but instead showed
muscle rigidity. Regarding diet therapy, we changed the patient&#x2019;s diet to Science Diet k/d
(Hill&#x2019;s Pet Nutrition), which is a protein-restricted but not carbohydrate-restricted diet,
and there was no history of feeding the patient a carbohydrate enriched diet, such as one
containing sweet potato or rice. In the present case, the patient was referred with the chief
complaint of partial seizure-like cramping, and other diseases, including metabolic and brain
diseases, were ruled out by neurologic examination, blood panel, MRI and CT results. We
presumed the possibility of CECS, and Science Diet k/d was prescribed as a trial therapy. The
exact mechanism of diet therapy in CECS has not been found, but the clinical signs in the
present case dramatically disappeared after applying the diet therapy, so we diagnosed the
patient as having CECS. This is the first case report of CECS in a Yorkshire terrier.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, muscle hypertonicity syndromes, such as CECS, have a similar spectrum of
clinical signs to that of partial seizure, and it is difficult to determine whether they are
accompanied by pain. These difficulties prevent the clinician from recognizing cramping
syndrome in veterinary medicine. Therefore, clinicians must consider the possibility of
cramping syndrome in cases presenting with apparent partial seizure episodes, and a trial diet
therapy could be the initial treatment option before administration of antiepileptic drugs.
Furthermore, we found that CECS can occur in Yorkshire terriers. Therefore, further genetic
studies including other breeds are needed.</p>
