    <p><bold>Clinical Data</bold>: Progressive fatigue on exertion has been noted for two decades,
despite operative intervention 10 years ago for the closing of interatrial communication,
valvar and tricuspid annulus plastia, and plication of the right atrium. Currently, it is
presented with fatigue for small efforts, lower limbs edema and in use of furosemide,
hydrochlorothiazide, amiodarone and spironolactone.</p>
    <p><bold>Physical exam</bold>: Slightly dyspneic, cyanotic, diminished pulses. Clear jugular
turgence at 30&#xBA;. Weight: 61 kg. Height: 154 cm. Blood Pressure (BP): 100/65 mmHg. Heart
Rate (HR): 80 bpm. Oxygen Saturation = 95%. The aorta was not palpable at suprasternal
notch.</p>
    <p>In precordium, <italic>ictus cordis</italic> was palpable diffusely and it had discrete
systolic impulses in the left sternal border. The heart sounds were markedly hypophonetic
and no cardiac murmur was auscultated. The liver was palpable 3 cm from the right costal
margin, with discrete ascites. Lower limbs edema was moderate.</p>

      <p><bold>Electrocardiogram</bold> it showed junctional rhythm and signs of right bundle
branch block with QRS complex duration (QRS) of 0.16' and low voltage in all leads.
Electrical axis of the QRS complex (QRS): +120&#xBA;, electrical axis of the T wave (AT):
+180&#xBA;.</p>
      <p><bold>Chest Radiography</bold> showed an enlarged cardiac area in very marked degree
(cardiothoracic ratio of 0.78), with long and globular atrial and ventricular arches.
Pulmonary vascular markings were markedly decreased.</p>
      <p><bold>Echocardiogram</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>) showed
marked increase in right heart chambers, absent septal, anterior and posterior valves
mobility and important degree of insufficiency. The right ventricle was so dilated that
occupied the apex of the heart. The left cavities were very depressed and compressed by
the accentuated increase in the right cavities. Inferior vena cava with 31 mm and
suprahepatic veins very dilated and with spontaneous contrast. Left superior vena cava
drained in dilated coronary sinus. The tricuspid annulus measured 58 mm in relation to
the mitral annulus of 26 mm. The area of the right atrium was 90.1 cm<sup>2
</sup>(normal value &lt; 18 cm<sup>2</sup>) and with spontaneous contrast. The right
ventricle dilated so occupied the apex of the heart, showing pronounced systolic and
diastolic dysfunction with Myocardial Performance Index (MPI) = 0.92.</p>

          <p>Echocardiography in the apical 4-chamber view stands out the diagnostic elements
of Ebstein anomaly with tricuspid septal valve coupling with strong increase of
the right cavities responsible for the extreme rebound of the left cavities (A),
strong enlargement of right atrium and coronary sinus with tricuspid posterior
valve still in subcostal view (B), and the contrast of the right cavities very
enlarged and compressed left cavities in cross section view of the chest CT (C).

stress out the same aspect showed by the echocardiography, calculating that the final
diastolic volume of the right ventricle was of 508 mL/m<sup>2</sup> and left ventricle
was 48 mL/m<sup>2</sup>. Corresponding function of both ventricles, right and left, was
of 15 and of 68%, respectively.</p>
      <p><bold>Blood biochemical analysis:</bold> Hemoglobin: 11 g/dL, urea: 61 mg/dL,
creatinine: 2.07 mg/dL; Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP): 684 pg/mL.</p>
      <p><bold>Clinical Diagnosis:</bold> Ebstein Anomaly in severe heart failure, even after
operative correction, 10 years ago.</p>
      <p><bold>Clinical Rationale:</bold> Clinical findings were consistent with the diagnosis of
right heart failure due to Ebstein anomaly with severe dysfunction of the right
ventricle and tricuspid valve. The absence of heart murmur expressed that the right
cavities formed a single cavity with firm adherence of the tricuspid valve into the
right ventricular muscle. The great cardiomegaly seen on chest radiograph with decreased
pulmonary vascular markings guided to the diagnosis of this anomaly. Other imaging
tests, such as echocardiography and cardiac CT, consolidated the severity of the anomaly
by severe dilation and right ventricular dysfunction.</p>
      <p><bold>Differential Diagnosis:</bold> The clinical profile of right heart failure allied
with the severe increase in the cardiac area seen on chest radiography, could also be
present in pericardial processes, which are accompanied by severe pericardial effusion
or pericardial cysts and yet in cardiac tumors.</p>
      <p><bold>Conduct:</bold> Due to the strong repercussion of the Ebstein anomaly with heart
failure with functional class IV, extreme dilatation of the right cavities with clear
compression of the left cavities and with cardiac arrhythmia, that heart transplantation
was considered as the only viable therapeutic solution. The surgical repair of Ebstein
anomaly with necessary replacement of the tricuspid valve would not be enough to reverse
the long-standing ventricular dysfunction and under extreme operative risk.</p>
      <p><bold>Comments:</bold> Despite the Ebstein Anomaly being constituted in the greater
longevity among all congenital heart diseases, rarely, however, it reaches the sixth
decade of life. The unfavorable evolutionary problems, frequently in adulthood are
related to right heart failure, to supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias and
thromboembolic phenomena. Therefore, most of these defects must be operated in the first
decade of life, even without strong hemodynamic disturbances, particularly because it is
today considered that cardiac surgery is corrective and even curative, as it happens
with the cone technique introduced in our means by Da Silva<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p>
