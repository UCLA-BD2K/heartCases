        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>A three-and-a-half year-old female Rahmani ewe was presented suffering from
nervous symptoms. Grossly, a large cyst measuring 7 &#xD7; 4 cm and weighing 145 g occupied the
dilated left lateral ventricle. The overlying cerebral tissue was thin, atrophied and
congested. It tore easily, and the cyst was evacuated spontaneously. Microscopically,
liquefactive necrosis surrounded by aggregations of macrophages, eosinophils, lymphocytes,
fibroblasts and giant cells was predominantly observed. Hyperplasia and severe necrosis of
the ependymal cell lining of the lateral ventricle were observed. Extensive subependymal
inflammatory cell infiltrations, accompanied by neovascularization and fibroblastic
proliferation, were seen. Based on the gross and histopathological lesions and cyst
morphology and location, the cyst was diagnosed as <italic>Coenurus cerebralis</italic>.
This report describes a rare case of coenurus cyst in the left lateral cerebral ventricle
of a ewe and the associated lesion.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Coenurosis caused by <italic>Coenurus cerebralis</italic>, a bladder worm stage of
<italic>Taenia multiceps</italic>, is a common parasitic disease of sheep and goats in the
Afro-Asian region and constitutes a major health problem in sheep and goats worldwide [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
    <p><italic>Coenurus</italic> cysts are located in the cerebral hemispheres in 88&#x2013;96% (almost
equally distributed in the left and right hemispheres) and in the cerebellum in 4&#x2013;12% of
infected sheep [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Cysts may be present elsewhere in
the brain and spinal cord, protruding into the cerebral ventricles, but they are often found
near the surface of the parietal cerebral cortex [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].
The predilection sites of <italic>C. cerebralis</italic> cysts in the cerebral hemispheres of
sheep, especially the subarachnoid space, facilitate the nourishment of the cyst by
cerebrospinal fluid [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In contrast, bovine cerebral
<italic>Coenurosis</italic> is very rare, and the lateral ventricles seem to be the
preferred site for cysts localization [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Given that
there have been few reports to date describing localization of <italic>Coenurus</italic> cysts
in the cerebral ventricles of sheep; this study presents clinical and pathological findings in
a rare case of <italic>C. cerebralis</italic> in the left lateral ventricle.</p>
    <p>A three-and-a-half year-old female Rahmani ewe was admitted to the Clinic of Surgery; Faculty
of Veterinary Medicine, South Valley University in May 2011, suffering from nervous symptoms
that included loss of appetite, frequent bleating, dullness, torticollis, head inclination to
the right, ataxia, irregular gait, sometimes walking in a straight line, circling and pressing
the head against obstacles. Euthanasia of the affected ewe was carried out using an overdose
of barbiturate, and a routine necropsy was performed. Brain specimens were fixed in 10%
neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin by routine methods. Sections, 4
<italic>&#xB5;</italic>m in thickness, were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE).</p>
    <p>Grossly, a large cyst measuring 7 &#xD7; 4 cm and weighing 145 g occupied the dilated left lateral
ventricle. The cyst contained a translucent fluid and a large number of white clusters of
scolices budding from the internal layer of the cyst. The overlying cerebral tissue was thin,
atrophied and congested. It tore easily, and the cyst was evacuated spontaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1a</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Photographs from the dissected cranium of a ewe demonstrated (a) a large
<italic>Coenurus</italic> cyst evacuated from the left lateral ventricle through a
weak point of the cerebral hemisphere; the cyst contained many scolices and was almost
half the size of the brain; (b) dilatation of the left ventricle with pressure atrophy
of the surrounding cerebral tissue. A small cyst (yellow dotted line) measuring 2 &#xD7; 1.5
&#xD7; 1 cm in diameter was connected with the large cyst and left a cavity in the cerebral
tissue.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-75-1643-g001"/></fig>). The cyst was as large in size as half of the brain. A secondary smaller cyst
measuring 2 &#xD7; 1.5 cm in diameter may have been connected to the large one, leaving a cavity in
the cerebral tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1b</xref>). White clusters of
numerous rice-shaped scolices were attached to the germinal layer of the cyst. Interestingly,
<italic>Oestrus ovis</italic> larvae were observed in the frontal sinuses with congestion of
the nasal cavity.</p>
    <p>Histopathological findings revealed an extensive area of liquefactive necrosis in the
cerebrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2a</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Photomicrographs of cerebral tissues related to the <italic>Coenurus</italic> cyst

surrounded by macrophages, eosinophils, lymphocytes, fibroblasts and giant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2b</xref>). Numerous chronic abscesses with frequent
calcification were observed in the left hemisphere. The wall was formed of a thick layer of
fibrous tissue with numerous blood vessels surrounded by mononuclear lymphocytes and
eosinophils. The malacia revealed extensive infiltration of polymorph nuclear cells with
neuropil destruction, leaving blood vessels. Desquamation and degeneration of the ependymal
cells of the left ventricular wall were prominent. Moreover, hyperplasia of the ependymal cell
lining of the lateral ventricle was observed with microgliosis and neuronal degeneration of
the subependymal cerebral tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2c</xref>). Severe
ependymal necrosis with extensive inflammatory cell infiltration accompanied by
neovascularization and fibroblast cell proliferation in the neuropil was predominantly seen
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2d</xref>). The newly-formed blood vessels were
surrounded by an extensive collar of mononuclear cells. Focal areas of cerebral hemorrhages
were accompanied by neuronal degeneration. The meninges overlying the cerebral tissue revealed
hyperemia and perivascular lymphocytic infiltration.</p>
    <p>Fresh unstained samples of the internal fluid of the cyst revealed the rose thorn
protoscoleces typical of <italic>Taenia multiceps</italic>. The scolices had four suckers and
one rostellum armed with a double crown of around 25&#x2013;30 hooks with hooklets. The hooks and
hooklets were 175 and 119 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>m in length, respectively, and the suckers were
325 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>m each in diameter. Histologically, the cyst was composed of a single
capsule composed of a thick wall with a dense outer eosinophilic layer and an areolar,
disorganized inner layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3a</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Photomicrographs of the coenurus cyst revealed (a) a single capsule composed of a thick

prominent scolex with refractile hooklets and suckers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig.
3c</xref>).</p>
    <p><italic>Coenurus</italic> cysts are located mainly in the brain and spinal cord. In sheep,
the cysts were found in the cerebral hemisphere in 96% of the affected cases (43% in the left
hemisphere and 57% in the right) with the remaining 4% presented in the cerebellum [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. There have been a small number of reports of definitive
localization of coenuri in tissues of the brain in sheep and cattle. In cattle, cysts were
localized in the temporo-parietal lobe (28.5%), occipital lobe (23.3%), frontal lobe (19%),
cerebellum (14.3%), cerebrospinal lobe (9.5%) and spinal cord (4.9%) [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Similar localization was reported in goats [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The predilection sites of 299 <italic>Coenurus</italic> lesions in 120
symptomatic Sardinia sheep were as follows: cortex (241; 80.6%), cerebellum (22; 7.3%) and
thalamus (17; 5.7%). In the cortex, the lesions were mainly in the middle part (126, 52.3%),
followed by the frontal (63; 26.1%) and occipital parts (52; 21, 6%) [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The cysts were observed in other brain regions in sporadic cases (19;
6.4%), including the obex (2), medulla oblongata (4), mesencephalon (5), basal nucleus (6) and
spinal cord (2) [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Epstein <italic>et al.</italic>
[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] suggested that <italic>Coenurus</italic> cysts
develop through the pathway of the cerebrospinal fluid. In human coenurosis, the cerebrospinal
fluid pathway is often involved that incriminated in causing arachnoiditis and ependymitis
[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Most of the reported coenurus cysts in sheep are
related to the subarachnoid space and brain parenchyma [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To the authors&#x2019; knowledge, very few cases of localization of
<italic>Coenurus</italic> cysts in the lateral ventricles in sheep have been recorded. On
the other hand, although coenurosis is uncommon in cattle, there have been several reports of
cases involving ventricular cysts [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
    <p>In the present study, an extensive area of cerebral liquefactive necrosis correlating to the
evacuated <italic>Coenurus</italic> cyst was surrounded by macrophages, lymphocytes,
fibroblasts and giant cells. Hyperplasia and severe necrosis of the ependymal cell lining of
the lateral ventricle were observed. Moreover, extensive subependymal inflammatory cell
infiltration was seen, accompanied by neovascularization and fibroblastic proliferation in the
neuropil. Similar lesions that included neuronophagia, demyelination, satellitosis,
perivascular lymphocytic cuffing, liquefactive necrosis and gliosis were previously observed
[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The
changes in the ependymal cell lining are secondary to the occurrence of cysts inside the
ventricle. Cerebral echinococcosis has been reported in the cerebra of 43 Armenian sheep,
inducing symptoms similar to those of cerebral coenurosis [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The hydatid cyst exhibited rich vascularity in the wall with a thick and shiny
outer layer (cuticula) and an inner germinative membrane, and smaller vesicles and scolices
attached to the walls. Microscopically, the cyst fluid contained free scolices and typical
parts of the multilayer membrane [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The
<italic>Coenurus</italic> cysts were larger, separated easily from the surrounding tissues
and were superficially located. The surrounding tissues of the cysts had a smooth surface and
were dark pink in color. The cysts had no vascularity and possessed 20&#x2013;75 scolices attached to
the wall [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The characteristics of the cysts in the
present study are extremely similar to those of <italic>Coenurus cerebralis,</italic> except
for the intraventricular location. In the current investigation, ventricular coenurosis was
associated with the presence of <italic>Oestrus ovis</italic> larvae infection in the frontal
sinuses. An association between <italic>Oestrus ovis</italic> larvae and surgically treated
cases of sheep coenurosis has been reported [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the
present work, the association of the <italic>Coenurus</italic> cyst with <italic>Oestrus
ovis</italic> could possibly be attributed to the high incidence of the latter among sheep
and goats in Egypt [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
