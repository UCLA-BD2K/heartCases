    <p>Enteroviruses have been reported to be a potential trigger of the development of type 1 diabetes by inducing &#x3B2;-cell autoantibodies and by directly destroying &#x3B2;-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Although the precise underlying mechanisms for enterovirus-mediated development of diabetes remain unknown, the systematic review and meta-analysis of observational molecular studies demonstrates a clinically significant association between enteroviral infections detected by molecular methods and type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Here we report a case of juvenile-onset insulin-dependent diabetes resulting from various enteroviral infections.</p>
    <p>A 20-year-old man was referred and admitted to our hospital because of a penile inflammation, suffering from general fatigue, and body weight loss for 2 weeks in March 2011. He had a high fever (38&#x2013;39&#xB0;C) at 2 weeks before the admission. His plasma glucose (430 mg/dL) and HbA<sub>1c</sub> (10.3%) levels were significantly elevated. Serum ketone bodies were elevated (615 &#x3BC;mol/L; normal, &lt;130 &#x3BC;mol/L); however, blood pH was normal. The intensive insulin therapy promptly ameliorated his blood glucose, and his blood glucose levels were 100&#x2013;120 mg/dL by using 20 and 15 units of insulin glulisine before breakfast and dinner, respectively, and 11 units of insulin glargine at bedtime. His urinary C-peptide level was significantly reduced (19.4 &#x3BC;g/day; normal, 29.2&#x2013;167 &#x3BC;g/day). &#x3B2;-Cell autoantibodies, anti-GAD, and anti-IA2 autoantibodies were not detected. He has been consistently treated by insulin after the admission. Plasma glucose and HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels were 126 mg/dL and 5.8%, respectively, by using 18 and 12 units of insulin glulisine before breakfast and dinner, respectively, and 12 units of insulin glargine at bedtime.</p>
    <p>We studied neutralizing antibodies for enteroviruses at the time of admission and at 2 weeks after admission. On admission, serum levels of neutralizing antibodies for coxsackievirus A2 (8&#xD7;; normal, &lt;4&#xD7;), A4 (32&#xD7;; normal, &lt;4&#xD7;), A5 (64&#xD7;; normal, &lt;4&#xD7;), B1 (8&#xD7;; normal, &lt;4&#xD7;), B2 (8&#xD7;; normal, &lt;4&#xD7;), B4 (64&#xD7;; normal, &lt;4&#xD7;), B5 (32&#xD7;; normal, &lt;4&#xD7;) and enterovirus 71 (8&#xD7;; normal, &lt;4&#xD7;) were significantly elevated, suggesting a history of infections by various enteroviruses. The neutralizing antibody for coxsackievirus A7 was not detected on admission; however, it was significantly elevated (8&#xD7;; normal, &lt;4&#xD7;) at 2 weeks after the admission, indicating a recent infection by coxsackievirus A7.</p>
    <p>Coxsackievirus B2, B4, B5, and enterovirus 71 have been reported to be associated with the development of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). To our knowledge, the association between coxsackievirus A7 infection and diabetes has not been discussed in regard to humans. Coxsackievirus A7 has been reported to impair &#x3B2;-cells by inducing an increase of tumor necrosis factor-&#x3B1; in mice as well as coxsackievirus B4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Further, coxsackievirus A7-infected pancreatic islet cells have been proved to be a suitable model for studies of experimental infection of pancreatic islet cells with coxsackieviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). These findings suggest a significant association of coxsackievirus A7 infection for the development of diabetes in our patient.</p>
    <p>In summary, the past history of infections by various enterovuses, which have been reported to induce an impairment of &#x3B2;-cells, and a recent infection by coxsackievirus A7 may be associated with the development of &#x3B2;-cell autoantibody-negative insulin-dependent diabetes in our patient.</p>
