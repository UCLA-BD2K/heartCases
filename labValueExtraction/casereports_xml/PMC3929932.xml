      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Pyogenic granuloma is an exuberant proliferation of granulation tissue that typically develops after minor trauma or surgery. It occurs most often on the skin of the face and extremities. Ocular pyogenic granulomas are usually found on the external surface of the eyelid or the palpebral conjunctiva. Corneal pyogenic granuloma is rare-only few cases have been reported, and the probable reason could be corneas' avascularity (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). A constant clinical finding of these reported corneal lesions is either an epithelial defect in the presence of corneal neovascularization and ocular surface disease or mechanical irritation. It usually develops after trauma or following infections. It can rarely complicate corneal surgeries, and there is one report following penetrating Keratoplasty (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Because of its rarity, it could be misdiagnosed as ocular malignant lesion and could end up in destructive surgeries like enucleation (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p>
      <p>We report an unusual case of pyogenic granuloma of the cornea in a 4 year old male child presented to Jimma University Specialized Hospital Ophthalmology Department in September 2012.</p>

      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>A four years old boy was admitted to Jimma University Specialized Hospital Department of Ophthalmology on September 14, 2012 with a complaint of fleshy growth on the right eye. Eight days before presentation, the family noticed a small, fleshy, pinkish growth at the center of the right eye. The lump increased in size within a short period and caused irritation and difficulty closing the lids. The child had ocular pain, redness of the eye, photophobia and swelling of the lids for six weeks before the development of the lump. Subsequently, the symptoms worsened and the child lost vision after a few weeks of the onset of pain and redness. He had eye discharge and difficulty opening the eye since the onset of the illness. There was no known history of trauma to the eye. He was not given herbal medication.</p>
      <p>On examination, the eye was full of mucopurulent discharge; the cilia were matted; the lid was swollen, and the conjunctiva was injected. On the cornea, there was a pink, fleshy, vascularized, sessile mass (7mm &#xD7;5mm) at the center (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). There was a corneal ulcer with dense stromal infiltrate around the mass. Further detail was obscured by the opacity. Ultrasound examination of the right eye showed no mass arising from intraocular structures.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>With the impression of corneal pyogenic granuloma, we admitted the child. After admission, he was treated with topical ciprofloxacin every 1 hour for 2 days and then every 2 hours for three days. The eye was irrigated and cleaned daily with normal saline to wash off the discharge. Subsequently, the antibiotic was tapered till the infection was cleared (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>).</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="EJHS2401-0085Fig2"/>
      </fig>
      <p>After the infection was controlled, the mass was excised from the cornea and sent for pathologic examination (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>). The histopathological examination showed extensive ulceration of the corneal epithelium with underlying granulation tissue formation and regeneration of the remaining epithelium and no atypia was seen within the limit of the biopsy.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>After excision of the mass, central corneal stromal defect developed. The patient was followed up for more than a month with topical antibiotic and cycloplegic. Subsequently, the defect healed and leucoma corneal opacity (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>) developed with the final visual acuity of light perception.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Pyogenic granulomas were originally described by Poncet and Dor in 1897 (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The term is a misnomer since it contains neither the inflammatory (purulent) exudate nor the typical epitheloid giant cell reaction characteristic of granulomatous inflammation. They are lesions composed of granulation tissue similar to that seen in wound healing. Granulation tissue consists of proliferating connective tissue (fibroblasts and fibrocytes) and newly formed capillary channels. Acute and chronic inflammatory cells are often interspersed between the fibrovascular elements.</p>
      <p>The common sites of its occurrence are the skin of the face and extremities. It may also occur in the mucosal regions such as gingiva, hard palate, cheek, tongue, and the nasal fossa. In the eye, it has been reported to arise at many sites, including the eyelid skin, conjunctiva, limbs, lacrimal puncta, acquired ophthalmic orbits and veins of the ocular adnexa. The occurrence of pyogenic granuloma on the cornea is relatively rare (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Its occurrence on the cornea was first reported by Minckler (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) who reported a case which was misdiagnosed as conjunctival Squamous cell carcinoma and after enucleation confirmed to be pyogenic granuloma of the cornea.</p>
      <p>The commonest clinical presentation of the corneal pyogenic granuloma is a rapidly growing lump which, on slit lamp examination, appears as well circumscribed, smooth surfaced, pink, sessile, and highly vascularized mass (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Our patient had a similar clinical presentation. There is also a case report with the appearance of smooth hemorrhagic surface due to bleeding into the mass (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The size of the mass in our patient was within the range of the reported cases which is 3&#xD7;3mm to 8x9mm. Most of the patients with pyogenic granuloma of the cornea had a rapid course with presentation within one month of the onset of the growth (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) which was also the case in our patient.</p>
      <p>Cornea pyogenic granuloma commonly grows at the sites of pre-existing corneal trauma or corneal ulcer due to infectious keratitis which are the two commonly identified risk factors (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Our patient also had infectious keratitis as a risk factor. The commonest type of trauma associated with corneal pyogenic granuloma is mechanical injury, and there is also a case report of corneal pyogenic granuloma following &#x201C;snake oil&#x201D; drop in the eye (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The other risk factors are ocular surgeries like penetrating Keratoplasty (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and surgery for ocular surface neoplasia (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). There is also a case report of spontaneous development of corneal pyogenic granuloma (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
      <p>The histopathological finding of our case was consistent with the common histopathological findings of corneal pyogenic granuloma. The typical histopathological finding of pyogenic granuloma is an excessive proliferation of granulation tissue with mononuclear cell infiltration (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p>
      <p>Corneal pyogenic granuloma can be a challenging case to diagnose especially if it involves the limbus. There were cases misdiagnosed as conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma and ended with enucleation (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Other differential diagnoses include anterior segment choristoma, a vascular hamartoma or a viral papilloma (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The age of onset, history of prior trauma or infection, rapid growth and the clinical appearance will often point to the correct diagnosis. Histopathologic examination of the tumor will confirm the diagnosis. In our patient, we suspected that the lesion was a pyogenic granuloma because it was acquired with underlying keratitis, grew rapidly and it was confirmed by histopathological examination.</p>
      <p>The treatment of corneal pyogenic granuloma is mainly surgical, which is excision. There is one case report which showed recurrence of the problem after excision (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). There was also a case with spontaneous remission (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). After surgical excision of the mass, the cornea may heal with scarring, especially if there is an underlying inflammatory process like our case. In such a condition, patients may benefit from optical Keratoplasty. Our patient did not get such service due to lack of well established service in our center and because the other centers were inaccessible for the patient.</p>
      <p>Despite its rarity, pyogenic granuloma should be considered in any patient with a fleshy, vascularized, elevated, rapidly growing corneal mass, especially in the setting of corneal infection. An excisional biopsy should be performed to make a definite diagnosis.</p>
