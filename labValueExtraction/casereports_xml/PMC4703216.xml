      <abstract>
        <p>Familial renal glycosuria is an inherited disorder resulting in glucose excretion in the urine despite normal blood glucose concentrations. It is most commonly due to mutations in the <italic>SLC5A2</italic> gene coding for the glucose transporter SGLT2 in the proximal tubule. Several drugs have been introduced as means to lower glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes targeting SGLT2 resulting in renal glycosuria, but no studies have addressed the potential effects of decreased renal glucose reabsorption and chronic glycosuria on the prevention of glucose intolerance. Here we present data on a large pedigree with renal glycosuria due to two mutations (c.300-303+2del and p.A343V) in the <italic>SLC5A2</italic> gene. The mutations, which <italic>in vitro</italic> affected glucose transport in a cell line model, and the ensuing glycosuria were not associated with better glycemic control during a follow-up period of more than 10 years. One individual, who was compound heterozygous for mutations in the <italic>SLC5A2</italic> gene suffered from severe urogenital candida infections and postprandial hypoglycemia. In conclusion, in this family with familial glycosuria we did not find any evidence that chronic loss of glucose in the urine would protect from deterioration of the glucose tolerance over time.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Familial renal glycosuria (FRG) is a rare disorder that is characterized by decreased renal reabsorption of glucose. In most published cases this abnormality is due to mutations in the <italic>SLC5A2</italic> gene, which encodes for the sodium glucose co-transporter 2, SGLT2 [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. SGLT2 is the major glucose co-transporter in the proximal tubule responsible for 90% of the renal glucose reabsorption while 10% is absorbed by the more distally located sodium glucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT1). It is noteworthy that SGLT2 also is the target for antidiabetic therapy. FRG is usually inherited in a co-dominant fashion with incomplete penetrance [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although glucose loss in the urine can range from 1 to 150 g/1.73m<sup>2</sup> FRG is generally considered as a benign condition, apart from anecdotal reports of polyuria, increased frequency of urinary tract infections and activation of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. No studies have addressed the potential effects of decreased renal glucose reabsorption and chronic glycosuria on the prevention of glucose intolerance.</p>
      <p>Early studies in rats reported beneficial effects of inhibition of the renal glucose reabsorption by phlorizin on the glucose tolerance and prompted the introduction of SGLT2 inhibitors as means to lower glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes. This treatment strategy was further justified by findings of increased SGLT2 expression and increased glucose uptake in the proximal tubule in biopsies from type 2 diabetes patients [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] although it is not known whether the increased expression is a cause or consequence of hyperglycemia. Furthermore, it has been shown that inhibition of glucose reabsorption by SGLT2 inhibitors increases endogenous glucose production and plasma glucagon concentrations in diabetic subjects [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and nondiabetic mice [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Notably, SGLT2 is also expressed in the alpha cells alongside SGTL1 [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Both of these glucose transporters are down regulated in islets from donors with type 2 diabetes and in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice after the development of hyperglycemia together with an increased expression of glucagon mRNA [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
      <p>Several SGLT2 inhibitors have been introduced for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and are also being tested in patients with type 1 diabetes. The therapeutic window of this class of drugs has been considered good with beneficial effects on weight and blood pressure and few other side effects than a slightly increased frequency of genital mycotic infections that seldom leads to discontinuation of the drug [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, these new drugs could also be considered for the prevention of diabetes. However, studies on the potential effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on prevention of diabetes are lacking. One possibility to address this question without testing the drug in a non-diabetic population would be to study non-diabetic carriers with FRG for their propensity to develop diabetes or deterioration of glucose tolerance. We did this in a large pedigree with FRG followed by repeated oral glucose tolerance tests for more than 30 years, after first confirming that their FRG was due to mutations in the <italic>SLC5A2</italic> gene. In this family we found no evidence that chronic loss of glucose in the urine would protect from deterioration of the glucose tolerance over time.</p>

        <title>Subjects</title>
        <p>A family with renal glycosuria from the Botnia region on the west coast of Finland has been followed clinically for the last 30 years [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition to renal glycosuria, 8 individuals developed impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) (<xref rid="pone.0146114.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) and the family were therefore followed by repeated oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT, 75 g glucose) as part of the Botnia Study [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To evaluate whether glucose loss in the urine in individuals with glycosuria would affect glucose tolerance we calculated the changes in the area under the OGTT curve (&#x394;AUC<sub>OGTT</sub>) between the first and last visit (mean follow up time 10.5 years, range 3&#x2013;22 years). AUC<sub>OGTT</sub> was calculated with the trapezoidal method from the plasma glucose concentrations at 0, 30, 60 and 120 minutes during the OGTT. One female family member (No 45 in the pedigree, <xref rid="pone.0146114.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) presented with marked glycosuria associated with symptoms of postprandial hypoglycemia and severe chronic urinary tract infections (predominantly candida infections). Under controlled conditions with a daily intake of 160 grams of carbohydrates, she excreted 55.2 g glucose/24 hours. She died from a gastric cancer at the age of 49 years. A paraffin embedded gastric biopsy was used for extraction of her DNA. Thin sections of the tissue were carefully scraped off the block using a scalpel and put into xylene for paraffin removal and the DNA was extracted using the QIAmp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions.</p>

        <p>The DNA extracted from the paraffin embedded tissue was unfortunately not of sufficient quality for sequencing; therefore two potentially functional mutations (c.300-303+2del and p.A343V) were imputed from sequencing data from her husband, children and grandchildren and then genotyped in the index case, family member 45, using a Taqman assay and a PCR with genotype specific primers (<xref rid="pone.0146114.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).</p>
        <p>To investigate the prevalence of glycosuria in the general population we extracted data on urine glucose excretions during OGTT from 4999 individuals part of the Botnia Study [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This was related to diagnosis of IGT/T2D using the &#x3A7;<sup>2</sup> test.</p>

A paired end 2x100 base pair sequencing was then performed on a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, CA, USA).</p>
        <p>After base calling and de-multiplexing using CASAVA 1.8.2 (Illumina, CA, USA) the fastq-files were quality assessed with FastQC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>) and aligned against Hs37d5 using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) v. 0.6.8 [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The Genome Analysis Tool Kit [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] (GATK) v. 1.6.2 was used on the resulting BAM-files for local realignment around known indels (IndelRealigner), for marking of duplicate reads (MarkDuplicates) and for base quality recalibration (CountCovariates and TableRecalibration). Variants were called using GATKs Unified Genotyper and variant recalibration (VariantRecalibrator and ApplyRecalibrations) [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This procedure was done according to the GATK best practices (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/best-practices">https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/best-practices</ext-link>).</p>
        <p>As most mutations that cause FRG are located in the <italic>SLC5A2</italic> gene [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the initial filtering was restricted to variants within the region of this gene. Resulting variants were analysed with SnpEff v3.0 [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and SIFT [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] to evaluate functionality and potential effect of the variants on the resulting protein. Only variants predicted to be detrimental to the protein were tested for association with renal glycosuria in the family using Fisher&#x2019;s exact test. The ExPASy Translate tool [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] was used to predict the effect of mutations on the translation of the mRNA.</p>
        <p>The selected variants were validated in 23 family members by genotyping using custom made TaqMan assays (Life Technologies, CA, USA) according to the supplier&#x2019;s instructions.</p>

        <title>Functional studies expressing SGLT2 mutation in HEK293-cells</title>
        <p>We also tested whether the missense mutation in the <italic>SLC5A2</italic> gene (see below) influenced glucose transport and reabsorption in the tubule by expressing the wild type (WT) and mutant form of the protein (SGLT2) in HEK 293 [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] cells lacking the natural SGLT2 [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The WT cDNA sequence (<xref rid="pone.0146114.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 table</xref>) of <italic>SLC5A2</italic> was synthesized and mutated (GenScript USA Inc., NJ, USA) and the resulting cDNA was cloned into the neomycin resistance containing pCMV6-Neo vector (OriGene Technologies, Inc., MD, USA). The constructs were separately transfected into the HEK293 cell line in triplicates, and successfully transfected cells were selected using 0.8 mg/ml of G418 (Merk Millipore, MA, USA), an antibiotic often used to select for neomycin resistant cells, for 14 days. The cells were subsequently cultured in D-MEM (Cat# 41966029, Life Technologies, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin with a 50 &#x3BC;g/ml maintenance dose of G418. <italic>SLC5A2</italic> mRNA expression was measured by SYBR-green qPCR using <italic>SLC5A2</italic> mRNA specific primers designed to span exon junctions (<xref rid="pone.0146114.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).</p>
        <p>To evaluate the effect of the missense mutation in <italic>SLC5A2</italic> on glucose transport the transfected HEK293 cells were assayed using the Glucose Uptake Cell based Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical, MI, USA). Triplicates of the WT and mutant SGLT2 cell lines and the untransfected HEK 293 cell line were seeded at 2x10<sup>4</sup> cells per well in a 96-well plate and incubated over night. The relative mRNA expression was measured to compare the transfection and transcription efficiency of the six cell lines. The next morning, the cells were incubated in glucose and serum free medium containing 150 &#x3BC;g/ml of the fluorescent glucose analogue 2-deoxy-2[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]-D-Glucose (2-NBDG) for 30 minutes. The cells were then washed and treated according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions before measuring fluorescence of the cells using an Infinite 200 Pro plate reader (Tecan, M&#xE4;nnedorf, Switzerland). Untransfected cells were treated with the glucose uptake inhibitor Apigenin to control for unspecific uptake and the signal was used as background in the measurements. Relative glucose uptake was calculated as fluorescence normalized against WT-transfected signal and the difference between the WT-transfected cells and the mutant-transfected cells was tested with Student&#x2019;s t-test.</p>

        <p>By sequencing the <italic>SLC5A2</italic> gene in 23 members of the FRG family three novel and one previously reported variant were found, i.e. 3 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and one 6 base pair deletion (<xref rid="pone.0146114.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Two SNVs were intronic in no known regulatory region, and the third SNV was only seen in one of 23 samples, and therefor they were not considered any further. The deletion (c.300-303+2del) removed the four last base pairs in exon three as well as two base pairs of the conjunctive splice site and was by the ExPASy Translate tool [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] predicted to cause a premature stop codon, resulting in a shorter 117 residue peptide (<xref rid="pone.0146114.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

        <p>As the SNV was not found in the father of the offspring, it is likely that the missense mutation (p.A343V) is inherited from the index case suggesting that she would be compound heterozygous for the deletion (c.300-303+2del) and the missense mutation (p.A343V). To test this we performed TaqMan genotyping of the 6 bp deletion and PCR using genotype specific primers for the missense mutation of DNA from the index case. These analyses confirmed our hypothesis that she indeed was compound heterozygous for mutations in the <italic>SLC5A2</italic> gene as she carried both the 6 bp deletion (c.300-303+2del) and the missense mutation (p.A343V, <xref rid="pone.0146114.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>

        <title>Influence of the <italic>SLC5A2</italic> mutations on change in the glucose tolerance over time</title>
        <p>Of 13 glycosuric family members, 5 had normal whereas 8 had abnormal glucose tolerance. To confirm that the glycosuria was due to a reduced threshold for glucose reabsorption in the kidney in these family members and not only a corollary of elevated plasma glucose we compared the prevalence of glycosuria between individuals with normal and abnormal glucose tolerance (IGT or T2D) and between those with the <italic>SLC5A2</italic> mutations (6 of whom also had abnormal glucose tolerance). Among 4999 individuals from the Botnia study, 95% of all glycosuric individuals had IGT or T2D and, vice versa, 64% of patients with IGT/T2D had glycosuria (&#x3A7;<sup>2</sup> p&lt;0.0001). Although glycosuria was also present in 9.5% of the individuals with normal glucose tolerance, these individuals had significantly higher glucose area under the curve during OGTT compared to those without glycosuria (n = 323, 1005 mmol&#xB7;l<sup>-1</sup>&#xB7;min compared to 812 mmol&#xB7;l<sup>-1</sup>&#xB7;min, p = 0.001). To explore how common the c.300-303+2del mutation was in Finland we genotyped 2584 individuals from Botnia for the c.300-303+2del mutation and identified 10 additional individuals from 5 families with the deletion. Next we analysed whole exome sequence data from the GOT2D consortium including individuals from the Botnia region. Of the 2760 screened individuals two carried the c.300-303+2del mutation and they both came from the Botnia region. Both were glycosuric but they had also diabetes. In addition, in the GOT2D data set we found 36 other missense variants in the <italic>SLC5A2</italic> gene, 7 of which were previously reported in dbSNP [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
        <p>To test whether chronic glycosuria as seen with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors would prevent diabetes or deterioration of the glucose tolerance we assessed changes in the glucose tolerance over time in glycosuric carriers and non-carriers of the mutation. As seen in <xref rid="pone.0146114.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, there was no protective effect of the loss of glucose in the urine with respect to change in glucose tolerance (p = 0.67, <xref rid="pone.0146114.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0146114.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0146114.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> Figs) or HbA<sub>1c</sub> (p = 0.09 <xref rid="pone.0146114.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>) over time in the mutation carriers. There was also no difference in glucose tolerance at the last visit (p = 0.64, <xref rid="pone.0146114.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Since treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors is associated with decreased body weight, an increase in the haematocrit values [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and an increase in total, LDL and HDL cholesterol concentration [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] we also examined changes in BMI, hematocrit and cholesterol between carriers and non-carriers. We did not observe any differences in the change in BMI (p = 0.33, <xref rid="pone.0146114.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0146114.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>), cholesterol (p = 0.14) or haematocrit (p = 0.10) between the two groups.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The molecular genetic analyses demonstrated that the renal glycosuria in this family was due to mutations in the <italic>SLC5A2</italic> gene. While most of the individuals were heterozygous for a deletion or a missense mutation in the <italic>SLC5A2</italic> gene, the index case, a person with more severe symptoms was compound heterozygous for both mutations. Given the long follow-up of this family as part of the Botnia study [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] we could also examine whether chronic loss of glucose in the urine had any influence on the changes in the glucose tolerance or the BMI. However, we did not find any such effect, but we need to keep in mind that these data are restricted to a single although large pedigree and we can therefore not generalize this observation to all carriers of mutations in the <italic>SLC5A2</italic> gene.</p>
      <p>In the majority of other reported cases of familial renal glycosuria the causal mutation has been located in the protein coding sequence of the <italic>SLC5A2</italic> gene [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In our study a novel frame shift deletion (c.300-303+2del) spanning the end of exon 3 and part of the splice site in intron 3 of the <italic>SLC5A2</italic> gene was found to be associated with glycosuria. All individuals carrying this novel mutation in its heterozygous form tested repeatedly positive for glucose in the urine (<xref rid="pone.0146114.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). In keeping with these findings heterozygous mutations in <italic>SLC5A2</italic> have previously been shown to result in mild symptoms of FRG.</p>
      <p>The deletion causes a frame shift that is predicted to introduce a stop codon at amino acid residue 117, causing premature end of translation and resulting in a truncated peptide (<xref rid="pone.0146114.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>) with reduced function, as predicted by snpEff [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The resulting peptide would lack the transmembrane helices that are necessary for glucose transport [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
      <p>The index case, a female member of the pedigree (No 45) had shown more severe symptoms including postprandial hypoglycemia as well as chronic urinary and genital infections, predominantly mycotic candida infections. Because of the severe symptoms she was examined at the Helsinki University Central Hospital in the 1970&#x2019;s with a kidney biopsy that showed no specific histological changes. However, she had excreted glucose already at low plasma glucose concentrations.</p>
      <p>We therefore hypothesized that she would have been homozygous for the deletion found in the other family members. Unfortunately, we could not include her DNA in the exome sequencing efforts as she had died from a gastric tumor in 1989, and no DNA had been taken in the 70ies. We however imputed her genotype from her husband, daughter and grandchildren and the most likely segregating variant in the <italic>SLC5A2</italic> gene was a p.A343V mutation, which we confirmed by genotyping DNA from her gastric biopsy. The missense mutation (p.A343V) is located in a helical structure in the hydrophilic chains on the extracellular side of the membrane based on homology modeling of SGLT2 (SWISS-MODEL Repository [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]). This helix together with another extracellular helical structure is supposed to be important for conformational changes necessary for sodium and glucose transport [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This was also tested by expressing the mutation in HEK 293 cells, where it resulted in impaired glucose transport (<xref rid="pone.0146114.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). It is therefore likely that the index case carried two damaging mutations in the <italic>SLC5A2</italic> gene resulting in an extremely low threshold for glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule.</p>
      <p>Recently a novel class of drugs has been introduced for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, namely SGLT2 inhibitors [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] that mimic the effect of the mutations described above. Taking advantage of the long follow-up of these family members, we also analyzed whether chronic glycosuria would have beneficial effects on changes in the glucose tolerance over time.</p>
      <p>Whereas the level of glycemia is strongly correlated with the degree of glycosuria in a population with diabetes, this was not the case in the mutation carriers. Mutation carriers also did not show less increase in AUC<sub>OGTT</sub> or HbA<sub>1c</sub> over time than non-carriers of the mutation (<xref rid="pone.0146114.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>) as would be expected if chronic glycosuria would protect against deterioration of glycemia and development of diabetes.</p>
      <p>Although SGLT2 is predominantly found in the proximal tubule, it has been shown that the alpha cells of human pancreatic islets also express SGLT2 as well as the high-affinity, low-capacity transporter SGLT1 [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We confirmed the expression of these transporters at mRNA level in 131 islet preparations from human cadaver donors. It has been suggested that <italic>SLC5A2</italic> affects glucagon secretion in human islets [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but we did not observe any correlation between <italic>SLC5A2</italic> and <italic>GCG</italic> mRNA or the glucagon secretion in the large islet sample (<xref rid="pone.0146114.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Instead the more highly expressed <italic>SGLT1</italic> gene was strongly correlated with the expression of the glucagon gene (<xref rid="pone.0146114.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). However, in contrast to previous data [<xref rid="pone.0146114.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], this expression was not influenced by the diabetic status of the donor. Interestingly, <italic>SLC5A2</italic> was positively correlated with the insulin gene, the consequence of which is unknown.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, mutations in the SLC5A2 gene were the most likely cause of renal glycosuria in this family. Compound heterozygosity of mutations in the <italic>SLC5A2</italic> gene was associated with a severe form of the disease characterized by chronic urogenital candida infections and postprandial hypoglycemia. In this family we found no evidence that chronic loss of glucose in the urine would protect from deterioration of the glucose tolerance over time. This could be another example of difficulties in targeting homeostatic mechanisms in human metabolism.</p>
