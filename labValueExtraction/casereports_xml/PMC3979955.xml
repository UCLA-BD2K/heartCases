        <p>Feline pituitary tumors are rare. An 8-year-old male Japanese domestic cat presented with
anorexia and emaciation. The cat died 17 days after admission from progressive
neurological symptoms. At necropsy, a pituitary tumor measuring 25 &#xD7; 18 &#xD7; 15 mm was found.
Microscopically, the tumor was divided into multiple lobules and had grown invasively into
the adjacent brain tissue and sphenoid bone. Tumor cells had pleomorphic nuclei with
prominent centrally located nucleoli and abundant amphophilic polygonal cytoplasm.
Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells stained with anti-adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH), &#x3B1;-melanin-stimulating hormone (MSH) and &#x3B2;-endorphin antibodies. Ultrastructurally,
the cytoplasm of the tumor cells contained various sized secretory granules. Based on
these pathological findings, this tumor was diagnosed as pituitary carcinoma originated
from pars intermedia cells.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Brain tumors are rare in cats [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The most commonly seen brain tumors in cats are
meningioma and lymphoma, which account for 75% of all feline brain tumors [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Pituitary tumors occur in only 9.3% of cats affected
with brain tumors and may manifest with endocrine or neurological symptoms, such as ataxia,
circling and seizure, which may occur depending on the location of the tumor [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. About 18% of feline pituitary tumors are found
accidentally at postmortem examination, which indicates the difficulty in diagnosing this
disease [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In dogs, pituitary-dependent
hypercortisolism (PDH) is a common disease. The causative adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH)-producing tumor in the adenohypophysis may arise from either the anterior lobe or the
pars intermedia [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In cats, pituitary tumors with PDH
are rare and are usually associated with diabetes mellitus [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. To the authors&#x2019; knowledge, the concomitant presence of pituitary carcinoma and
PDH without diabetes mellitus has not been reported.</p>
    <p>An 8-year-old, castrated male Japanese domestic cat, weighing 3.7 kg, was referred to the
Veterinary Teaching Hospital of Kitasato University for detailed examination of unexplained
anorexia and weight loss. The cat had been treated by a local veterinarian for 1 month before
visiting us, but the condition had not been ameliorated by palliative care. The owner also
noted a seizure-like episode during this period. At the first admission to our hospital, the
cat showed neurological symptoms, such as depression, head tilt, ataxia and circling to the
right side. Upon physical examination, asymmetrical pupil dilation was also noted. Pulse (156
beats per min), respiration (78 breaths per min), body temperature (38.6&#xB0;C) and other physical
findings were considered normal.</p>
    <p>A complete blood count included band neutrophils(0/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>), segmented
neutrophils (24,284/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>), lymphocytes (650/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>), monocytes
(1,040/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>), eosinophils (0/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>) and basophils
(0/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>). These results suggested eosinopenia and a classic stress leukogram.
Plasma biochemistry showed high blood glucose (345 mg/d<italic>l</italic>, reference 70&#x2013;110
mg/d<italic>l</italic>) and low potassium (2.22 mEq/<italic>l</italic>, reference 3.5&#x2013;5.0
mEq/<italic>l</italic>) levels. Other biochemical parameters were within the normal range.
Urinalysis was performed on a sample obtained by bladder puncture. The urine had a specific
gravity of 1.041 (reference 1.035&#x2013;1.060) and pH 6.3 (reference 5.0&#x2013;9.0). Excretion of glucose
(500&#x2013;1,000 mg/d<italic>l</italic>) and protein (30&#x2013;100 mg/d<italic>l</italic>) into the urine
was noted using a dipstick.</p>
    <p>Abdominal ultrasound revealed bilateral enlargement of the adrenal glands. Based on these
findings, we speculated that the cat had a pituitary&#x2013;adrenal axis abnormality, and therefore,
the cat was hospitalized for further neurological and endocrine examinations. Computed
tomography (CT) was performed on the cat under anesthesia with isoflurane in oxygen.
Transverse contrast-enhanced CT images of the brain revealed a large ovoid-shaped mass in the
area of the pituitary gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>An enlarged pituitary mass (arrows) is seen in the pituitary fossa by CT. Bar=1 cm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-133-g001"/></fig>). The mass appeared to be hyperintense compared with the surrounding parenchyma, and
the signal for this area was enhanced further by bolus intravenous administration of the
iodinated contrast agent iohexol (1 m<italic>l</italic>/kg). There was no sign of edema around
the mass. The maximum width and height of the mass were 18.6 and 10.4 mm, respectively. The
mass in the hypophyseal fossa matched the characteristics of previously reported pituitary
tumors [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and therefore, this case was tentatively
diagnosed as a pituitary macroadenoma.</p>
    <p>The integrity of the hypothalamus&#x2013;pituitary&#x2013;adrenocortical system was assessed by a series of
endocrine examinations. A high-dose dexamethasone suppression test was performed by
intravenous administration of dexamethasone (DEX, 1 mg/kg) in the morning. Plasma was obtained
for measurement of cortisol concentration before, and 4 and 8 hr after administration of DEX.
The results showed a maximum 76% suppression at 4 hr after DEX injection compared with the
basal cortisol concentration of 13.1 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic>.</p>
    <p><italic>The plasma concentrations of the following endogenous hormones were also
measured</italic>: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), ACTH, growth hormone (GH) and
antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The plasma concentrations of TSH (0.93
<italic>n</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic>), GH (1.3 <italic>n</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic>)
and ADH (6.4 <italic>p</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic>) were within the normal ranges. By
contrast, the plasma concentration of ACTH of 472 <italic>p</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic> far
exceeded the physiological range. On the basis of these endocrine findings, the present case
was diagnosed as PDH.</p>
    <p>During hospitalization, the cat was treated continuously by intravenous
potassium-supplemented fluid administration to correct dehydration and hypokalemia. A
nasogastric tube was placed to force-feed the cat with high-caloric liquid formula for
anorexia. However, further treatments, such as surgery or radiation therapy, were not desired
by the owner. The cat showed progressive morbidity and died on day 17 of hospitalization.</p>
    <p>At necropsy, a tumor, measuring 25 mm (length) &#xD7; 18 mm (width) &#xD7; 15 mm (height), was found in
the region of the pituitary gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Sagittal section showing the mass in the region of the pituitary gland (arrows). The
borders between the tumor and brain are not clear. Bar=2 cm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-133-g002"/></fig>). The tumor had increased hardness compared with the surrounding parenchyma and had
completely replaced the pituitary gland. The borders between the tumor and brain were not
clear. The tumor compressed the overlying hypothalamus and the thalamus, midbrain and brain
stem. The lateral ventricle was dilated. Both adrenal glands (left, 15 &#xD7; 7 mm; right, 25 &#xD7; 6
mm) were enlarged. The lungs were edematous and congested. The thyroid glands and parathyroid
glands were normal in shape and size.</p>
    <p>The pituitary gland tumor and brain, adrenal glands, kidney, liver, spleen, lung, thyroid
glands and parathyroid glands were examined histopathologically. All samples were fixed in 10%
neutral-buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. All sections were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (HE). The pituitary tumor was also prepared for staining with Masson&#x2019;s
trichrome, reticulin silver impregnation, periodic acid&#x2013;Schiff (PAS) and immunohistochemistry.
A normal pituitary gland of another cat was used as the control for immunohistochemistry.
Immunohistochemical examinations were performed using the streptavidin-biotin peroxidase
method with commercial kits (Nichirei Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The following primary antibodies
were used: cytokeratin (CK) (Clone AE1/AE3; Dako-Japan, Kyoto, Japan; 1:50), ACTH (Clone
18&#x2013;0087; Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA, U.S.A; 1:50), &#x3B1;-melanocyte-stimulating hormone
(MSH) (Clone DS-040398; Progen Biotechnik, GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany; 1:1,000), &#x3B2;-endorphin
(H-022&#x2013;33; Phoenix, Pharmaceuticals, Belmont, CA, U.S.A; 1:500), GH (Clone A572/R4H;
Biogenesis, Poole, U.K.; 1:400), luteinizing hormone (LH) (Clone 410M; Biomeda, Foster, CA,
U.S.A; prediluted), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (Clone 411M; Biomeda; prediluted),
prolactin (Clone 413M; Biomeda; prediluted), Ki-67 (Clone MIB-1; Dako-Japan; prediluted) and
proliferating cell nuclear antigens (PCNA) (Clone PC10; Dako-Japan; prediluted).</p>
    <p>To investigate the possible correlations between the Ki-67 and PCNA labeling indexes (LIs)
and their clinicobiological variables, Ki-67- and PCNA-positive nucleoli were scored by
counting at least 1,000 cells in representative &#xD7; 400 high-power fields. The percentages of
positively stained cells were recorded as the Ki-67 and PCNA LIs. For electron microscopic
examination, the formalin-fixed pituitary gland tumor was cut into 1 mm blocks, fixed in 1%
buffered osmium tetroxide and embedded in epoxy resin. Sections of about 70 nm in thickness
were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined using a transmission electron
microscope (H-7650, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
    <p>Microscopically, the tumor was not encapsulated and had grown invasively into the adjacent
brain tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>The tumor (T) is not encapsulated, and tumor cells have grown invasively into the
adjacent brain (*) tissue. HE. Bar=50 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-133-g003"/></fig>) and sphenoid bone. The tumor caused massive destruction of the adjacent hypothalamus
and midbrain structures, and many vacuolated nerve fibers and fragmentation of axons were
observed in the white matter tracts. The tumor had lobular, trabecular, alveolar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_004" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Tumor cell proliferation in alveolar patterns surrounded by vascular connective tissue.

adenoid structures were sometimes filled by eosinophilic colloidal material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_005">Fig. 5</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_005" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>The tubular or adenoid structures are filled by colloid materials (arrows). HE. Bar=50

anisokaryosis. The nucleoli were large and centrally located. The amount of cytoplasm in the
tumor cells was variable, and the cytoplasm was slightly basophilic. Evidence of frequent
mitosis was observed (1&#x2013;7 per &#xD7; 400 high-power field). Occasionally, multinuclear giant cells
and atypical cells with intranuclear eosinophilic pseudoinclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_006">Fig. 6</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_006" position="float"><label>Fig. 6.</label><caption><p>Most tumor cells have atypical nuclei with large nucleoli and abundant, slightly

eosinophilic pseudoinclusions (arrows) are observed. HE. Bar=50 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-133-g006"/></fig>) were also observed. In the stromal area, evidence of connective tissue was prominent,
and these areas stained positively with Masson&#x2019;s trichrome and reticulin silver impregnation.
Other histopathological findings included bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia in the region
of the zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculata. There were no pathological changes in other
organs including the parathyroid and thyroid glands. Distant metastasis of the tumor cells was
not observed.</p>
    <p>Immunohistochemically, most of the tumor cells were positive for ACTH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_007">Fig. 7</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_007" position="float"><label>Fig. 7.</label><caption><p>Most tumor cells stain positively for ACTH. Immunohistochemistry. Bar=25
<italic>&#xB5;</italic>m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-133-g007"/></fig>), &#x3B1;-MSH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_008">Fig. 8</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_008" position="float"><label>Fig. 8.</label><caption><p>Many tumor cells are positive for &#x3B1;-MSH.

to those of the pars intermedia cells of normal pituitary gland of cat used as a positive
control. By contrast, few tumor cells were positive for LH, FSH and prolactin. The mean LIs
were 35% for PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_009">Fig. 9</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_009" position="float"><label>Fig. 9.</label><caption><p>Many tumor cells are positive for PCNA. Immunohistochemistry. Bar=50

<italic>&#xB5;</italic>m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-133-g010"/></fig>); by contrast, the mean percentage of cells positive for each antibody was&lt;1% in the
normal pituitary gland.</p>
    <p>Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells showed nuclear pleomorphism and often had deeply
invaginated nuclei. The cytoplasm comprised abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria
and secretory granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_011">Fig. 11</xref>) of various sizes.
The diameters of secretory granules were in the range of 100&#x2013;300 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_012">Fig. 12</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_011" position="float"><label>Figs. 11 and 12.</label><caption><p> Tumor cells have prominent nucleoli, deeply invaginated nuclei and cytoplasm filled

    <p>Hypercortisolism is an endocrine disorder caused by elevated production of cortisol by the
adrenal cortex. Cats with hypercortisolism frequently present with characteristic clinical
signs, such as cutaneous atrophy, polyphagia, polyuria, obesity, muscle weakness and recurrent
urinary tract infections [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, this cat showed
suppressive neurological symptoms, such as depression and anorexia, both of which were most
likely caused by the pituitary tumor growth [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].
Hyperglycemia caused by the gluconeogenic action of cortisol is a common finding in feline
hypercortisolism. Prolonged hyperglycemia triggers insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and as
many as 80% of cats with hypercortisolism also have secondary diabetes mellitus [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, there is a strong link between
hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus in cats with hypercortisolism. In the current case,
hyperglycemia and glucosuria were confirmed on the first day of admission, but long-term
hyperglycemia was not confirmed because of the normal level of blood fructosamine, a long-term
index of blood glucose. These results indicated that although there was no overtly prolonged
hyperglycemia, the cat may have been at least in the prediabetic state.</p>
    <p>In the present case, CT images showed a large single space occupying tumor located in the
pituitary fossa, which extended into the parenchyma of the brain. Although the anatomical site
and CT features of the lesion were highly suggestive of a pituitary tumor or a sellar
meningioma, clinical findings including plasma biochemistry and a high-dose dexamethasone
suppression test excluded the possibility of a meningioma.</p>
    <p>Pituitary carcinomas are very rare in cats. Generally, the distinction between a pituitary
carcinoma and an adenoma is made on the basis of extensive invasion into the brain, sphenoid
bone, blood vessels and distant metastasis. However, the differential diagnosis between
adenoma and carcinoma is sometimes difficult and confusing in animals. Ki-67 and PCNA, markers
of cell proliferation, are used widely to predict tumor behavior and surgical outcomes [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In humans,
the mean Ki-67 LIs for noninvasive pituitary adenoma, invasive pituitary adenoma and pituitary
carcinoma were reported as 1.37% &#xB1; 0.15%, 4.66% &#xB1; 0.57% and 11.91% &#xB1; 3.41%, respectively
[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In pituitary adenomas in dogs, Ki-67 and PCNA
LIs were reported as 8.4% &#xB1; 14.2% and 35.5% &#xB1; 12.2%, respectively [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The ranges of Ki-67 and PCNA LIs in these reports are wide, and the
expression of these makers has not been investigated in feline pituitary tumors. Nevertheless,
in our case, all of the histopathology and immunohistochemistry results were consistent with
malignant properties.</p>
    <p>In the present case, the tumor cells sometimes had intranuclear eosinophilic inclusions.
These intranuclear inclusions are found in not only pituitary tumors [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] but also other tumors including meningioma [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], paraganglioma [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>],
phenochromocytoma [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and thyroid carcinoma [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] in humans. Intranuclear inclusions in pituitary tumors
are formed by cytoplasmic invagination and composed of cytoplasmic organelles, such as rough
endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus and the secretory granules [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, it was reported that there are no significant differences
in the frequency of the intranuclear inclusions between the functional and non-functional
pituitary tumors [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To our best knowledge, there is
no report about intranuclear inclusions in pituitary tumors in cats. Therefore, further data
collection is needed to better understand the relationship between intranuclear inclusions and
hormonal status or malignancy of the pituitary tumor in cats.</p>
    <p>Pituitary tumors in horses almost arise from the pars intermedia and manifest as
hyperglycemia and adrenal cortical hyperplasia. In the dog, pars intermedia tumors contain
ACTH and &#x3B1;-MSH, and excessive secretion of ACTH leads to bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia
[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the
present case, most of tumors cells stained positively for ACTH, &#x3B1;-MSH and &#x3B2;-endorphin in their
cytoplasm [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. &#x3B1;-MSH, a peptide hormone, is derived from
proopiomelanocortin processing in the pars intermedia cells and is thought to be a marker of
pars intermedia cells. Although we did not measure the plasma &#x3B1;-MSH concentration in the
present study, the clinical signs, the histopathology and immunohistochemistry results
suggested that the tumor originated from pars intermedia cells. The rapid growth of the
pituitary carcinoma with massive destruction of the brain, rather than endocrine dysfunction,
seemed to be the major cause of the neurological signs and death.</p>
