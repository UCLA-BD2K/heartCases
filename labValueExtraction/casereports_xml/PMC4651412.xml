  <body>
    <p>An 88-year-old female was admitted due to pain and swelling of the left upper limb swelling
(September 28, 2011).</p>
    <p>She was first admitted to Instituto do Cora&#xE7;&#xE3;o (InCor) at the age of 73 years (December 12,
1996), because of chest angina on great exertion for 8 months.</p>
    <p>On that occasion, she reported arterial hypertension, glucose intolerance,
hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, family history of sudden death, and smoking
cessation at the age of 51 years.</p>
    <p>Her physical examination evidenced heart rate of 60&#xA0;bpm, blood pressure of 150/80 mmHg. Her
heart, lung and abdomen examinations were normal. Her lower limbs showed no edema and her
pulses were symmetrical.</p>
    <p>The electrocardiogram (December 9, 1996) revealed sinus rhythm, an electrically inactive
area in the inferodorsal wall, and ventricular repolarization changes with inverted T waves
from V<sub>1</sub> to V<sub>5</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
    <p>The laboratory tests (January 13, 1997) evidenced: glycemia, 115 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.4
mg/dL; total cholesterol, 295&#xA0;mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein (HDL-cholesterol), 56&#xA0;mg/dL;
low-density lipoprotein (LDL-cholesterol), 183&#xA0;mg/dL; and triglycerides, 179 mg/dL.</p>

    <p>Her coronary angiography (December 12, 1996) showed obstructions of 90% in the right
coronary and circumflex arteries, and of 70% in the anterior interventricular artery, in
addition to normal left ventricular motility.</p>
    <p>On January 20, 1997, the patient was submitted to successful coronary angioplasty with
stent implantation in the circumflex artery, and unsuccessful coronary angioplasty of the
right coronary artery, which was occluded. On January 29, 1997, she underwent coronary
angioplasty with stent implantation in the anterior interventricular coronary branch.</p>
    <p>The patient became asymptomatic. On August 8, 1997, control coronary angiography evidenced
occlusion of the right coronary artery, irregularities in the interventricular and
circumflex arteries, and a 70% obstruction in the first branch of the left marginal
artery.</p>
    <p>The laboratory assessment (March 25, 1998) showed: triglycerides, 338 mg/dL; total
cholesterol, 294 mg/dL; LDL-cholesterol, 181 mg/dL; and HDL-cholesterol, 45 mg/dL. On
January 27, 2000, a new laboratory assessment evidenced: triglycerides, 166 mg/dL; total
cholesterol, 289 mg/dL; LDL-cholesterol, 210 mg/dL; and HDL-cholesterol, 46 mg/dL.</p>
    <p>Simvastatin was added to the ongoing fenofibrate.</p>
    <p>The laboratory assessment (December 14, 2001) revealed: triglycerides, 239 mg/dL; total
cholesterol, 268 mg/dL; LDL-cholesterol, 160 mg/dL; and HDL-cholesterol, 60 mg/dL.</p>
    <p>The new coronary angiography (December 18, 2001) showed a 90% obstruction in the right
coronary artery, and complicated with injury and thrombosis of the right brachial artery.
Thromboembolectomy and brachial-brachial graft with the ipsilateral basilic vein were
performed.</p>
    <p>The patient remained asymptomatic until 2011, with the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus since
2008, when metformin and glybenclamide were prescribed.</p>
    <p>On August 2011, the patient sought medical care complaining of angina on moderate exertion,
being then submitted to coronary angiography (August 22, 2011), which showed: in-stent
restenosis of 90% associated with an 80% obstruction in the mid third of the anterior
interventricular artery; an 80% obstruction in the first branch of the diagonal artery; a
90% distal obstruction of the circumflex artery with patent coronary stent; an obstruction
in the ostium of the second branch of the left marginal artery; a 90% obstruction of the
right coronary artery; and preserved left ventricular motility.</p>
    <p>On September 15, 2011, the patient had prolonged chest pain at rest, and her laboratory
assessment showed: hemoglobin, 12.1 g/dL; red blood cell count, 37%; platelets,
348,000/mm<sup>3</sup>; creatinine, 1.11 mg/dL; potassium, 4 mEq/L; sodium, 140 mEq/L;
triglycerides, 223 mg/dL; total cholesterol, 175 mg/dL; HDL-cholesterol, 47 mg/dL;
LDL-cholesterol, 83 mg/dL; creatine kinase MB mass, 0.2 ng/mL; troponin, 0.064 ng/mL;
activated prothrombin time (APT) according to International Normalized Ratio (INR), 1; and
activated partial thromboplastin time ratio (APTT), 0.84.</p>
    <p>The electrocardiography performed on September 15, 2011, revealed sinus rhythm, diffuse
ventricular repolarization changes, and no changes of the special leads V<sub>3r</sub>,
V<sub>4r</sub>, V<sub>7</sub> and V<sub>8</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figures

    <p>The sequential laboratory assessment on September 16, 2011, showed creatine kinase MB mass
of 0.18 ng/mL and troponin of 0.34 ng/mL. On that same day, the patient underwent balloon
angioplasty of the first diagonal branch, with stenting of the anterior interventricular
artery. Bleeding, hemoglobin drop to 8.8 g/dL and pseudoaneurysm formation at the left
femoral artery puncture site occurred.</p>
    <p>On September 20 and 23, 2011, the pseudoaneurysm was injected with prothrombin, with
resolution of local bleeding. The patient was discharged on September 26, 2011.</p>
    <p>Two days after hospital discharge, she patient sought the emergency unit because of pain
and left upper limb swelling.</p>
    <p>The laboratory tests on September 28, 2011, showed: hemoglobin, 10.4 g/dL; red blood cell
count, 32%; medium corpuscular volume (MCV), 103 fl; leukocytes, 102,310/mm<sup>3</sup>
(band neutrophils 36%, segmented neutrophils 62%, lymphocytes 1%, monocytes 1%); platelets,
292,000/mm<sup>3</sup>; creatine kinase MB mass, 0.27 ng/mL; troponin I, 0.126 ng/mL;
creatinine, 2.52&#xA0;mg/dL (glomerular filtration, 19 mL/min/1.73&#xA0;m<sup>2</sup>); aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), 77 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 75 U/L; gamma glutamyl
transferase, 179 U/L; total bilirubin, 1.05 mg/dL; direct bilirubin, 0.55 mg/dL; sodium,
136 mEq/L; potassium, 4.6 mEq/L; APT (INR), 1.3; and APTT, 1.04.</p>
    <p>Doppler ultrasound showed venous thromboses in the left upper limb, and anticoagulant
therapy was initiated.</p>
    <p>A few hours later, the patient had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
After amiodarone infusion, she had dyspnea, consciousness lowering, respiratory failure
requiring orotracheal intubation for ventilatory support, and cardiac arrest with pulseless
electrical activity. She recovered, but showed high-grade atrioventricular block, atrial
fibrillation, severe bradycardia and right QRS axis deviation.</p>
    <p>On September 29, 2011, the laboratory tests were as follows: hemoglobin, 10.5 g/dL; red
blood cell count, 35%; MCV, 109 fl; leukocytes, 9,820/mm<sup>3</sup> (metamyelocytes 1%,
band neutrophils 40%, segmented neutrophils 41%, eosinophils 1%, lymphocytes 14%, monocytes
3%); platelets, 202,000/mm<sup>3</sup>; creatine kinase MB mass, 13.19&#xA0;ng/mL; troponin I,
1.22 ng/mL; urea, 108 mg/dL; creatinine, 2.82 mg/dL (glomerular filtration, 12
mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>); sodium, 135 mEq/L; potassium, 5 mEq/L; AST, 756 U/L; ALT, 312
U/L; gamma glutamyl transferase, 136&#xA0;U/L; total bilirubin, 1.19 mg/dL; direct bilirubin,
0.71 mg/dL; C-reactive protein, 209 mg/L; venous lactate, 105 mg/dL; APT (INR), 3.9; and
APTT, 7.97. Venous blood gas analysis showed: pH, 6.55; pCO<sub>2</sub>, 33.9 mm Hg;
pO<sub>2</sub>, 27.1 mm Hg; O<sub>2 </sub>saturation, 21.4%; bicarbonate, 2.8 mEq/L; and
base excess, (-) 29.8 mEq/L.</p>
    <p>The patient underwent temporary pacemaker implantation, but the refractory shock persisted.
She had a new cardiac arrest and no longer responded to resuscitation maneuvers, dying on
September 29, 2011.</p>
    <sec>
      <title>Clinical aspects</title>
      <p>The patient is an 88-year-old female, who, because of chest angina, underwent
percutaneous angioplasty with stenting, remaining asymptomatic for 13 years. The angina
reappeared, and, after a new percutaneous intervention, she died. She underwent seven
coronary angiographies, three of which with angioplasty and stenting. The fifth and
seventh procedures had complications.</p>
      <p>The first point of interest is the indication of intervention therapy with stenting to
an elderly patient with chest angina. Published studies support that indication. The
results of intervention therapy in patients older than 80 years (n&#xA0;=&#xA0;983) have shown a
four-year survival of 71.6% for stent implantation (n&#xA0;=&#xA0;289), better than that achieved
with isolated drug treatment (n = 561, survival of 60.3%)<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The good results of the intervention therapy were later
confirmed in 79/276&#xA0;patients (52%) aged 80&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;4 years, whose four-year survival was
72%<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The clinical experience
confirms those observations. Thus, in our patient, the percutaneous intervention therapy
performed for the first time at the age of 74 years and followed by 13 asymptomatic
years was again indicated, when she became&#xA0;symptomatic.</p>
      <p>The patient underwent seven coronary angiographies in 15&#xA0;years of follow-up, three of
which (42.9%) with percutaneous coronary intervention via brachial and femoral
punctures. Two of those revascularizations (66.7%) complicated with thrombosis, bleeding
and pseudoaneurysm formation, requiring surgery for thromboembolectomy in the first
event, and thrombin administration in the pseudoaneurysm and expectant management in the
second event.</p>
      <p>The second point of interest is performing coronary angiography in octogenarians, whose
mortality is higher (0.8%) than that of the general elderly population (0.11%). In that
age group, the risk of vascular complications, such as arterial occlusions requiring
surgical correction or thrombectomy, retroperitoneal bleeding, formation of hematoma,
pseudoaneurysm and arteriovenous fistula, as well as the risk of infection, is greater
(5%). Studies have confirmed that the diagnosis of femoral pseudoaneurysm occurred in
more than 0.2% of the cases, in 8% of the catheterization processes<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, the risk of pseudoaneurysm formation
being higher in cases whose compression of the femoral artery access was performed with
a device (39 in 1768 events &#x2013; 2.2%) as compared to those with manual compression (1720
events/1.7%) at the puncture site<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. A
meta-analysis has confirmed the risk of bleeding at the femoral artery puncture site,
comparing compression with devices (n&#xA0;=&#xA0;1700) to manual compression (n&#xA0;=&#xA0;1500), the
risks being 4.6% and 4.1%, respectively. The estimated risk of an intervention at the
puncture site is 1.6-fold higher with compression with devices than with manual
compression. The risks of blood transfusion and of arterial ischemia in the lower limb
for compression with devices were, respectively, 1.2 and 2.1 times greater than those
using manual compression. Despite the nonsignificant results, complications were more
frequently found when using compression with devices (3.8%) at the arterial puncture
site than when using manual compression (1.7%)<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>In the case discussed, the patient being of the female sex and submitted to therapeutic
percutaneous coronary intervention increased the risk for pseudoaneurysm
formation<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. The expectant
management of the femoral pseudoaneurysm assumes a vascular diameter smaller than 2 cm,
and the reason for not using ultrasound-guided percutaneous injection of thrombin might
have been the possibility of spontaneous thrombosis of the vascular content<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The third point of interest is the treatment of elderly patients with coronary artery
disease and its impact on survival. A study of 7472 octogenarians (mean age of 83 years)
undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention has reported mortality ranging from 0 to
19%, being around 5% for patients older than 85 years, the mortality predictors being as
follows: cardiogenic shock (31%); acute myocardial infarction (11%); lower ejection
fraction (35%); kidney failure (7.2%); first coronary intervention (2.7%); patients
older 85 years (1.8%); and diabetes mellitus (1.2%)<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The recommendation of optimized drug treatment as the initial option for patients with
chronic coronary artery disease is supported by a meta-analysis with 63 studies (1852
symptomatic and asymptomatic patients diagnosed with chronic coronary artery disease,
mean age ranging from 56 to 65 years), comparing four possibilities of procedures
(percutaneous coronary intervention <italic>versus</italic> drug treatment; angioplasty
with stent <italic>versus</italic> conventional balloon angioplasty; angioplasty with
stent <italic>versus</italic> drug treatment; angioplasty with drug eluting stent
<italic>versus</italic> angioplasty with bare-metal stent), with no difference in
mortality, acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery or need for
a new procedure within 12 months<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>In the case discussed, 15 years after coronary disease stratification and percutaneous
coronary intervention, the patient had angina on moderate exertion, suggesting that the
therapeutic strategy with percutaneous and drug revascularization, to control risk
factors, did not prevent disease progression.</p>
      <p>Considering that the patient had coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus, the
clinical experience confirms the greater risk for restenosis and occlusion after
revascularization procedures, via either percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary
artery bypass graft surgery, as compared to nondiabetic patients with multivessel
coronary disease. Hlatky et al.<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> have
reported similar mortality for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery
(575/3889 patients) and for those (628/3923) undergoing percutaneous coronary
intervention, 15% and 16%, respectively. In patients older than 65 years, however,
treatment changed mortality. In patients with diabetes, the mortality of those
undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (615 patients) was substantially lower
than that of those (618 patients) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention,
suggesting that coronary artery bypass graft surgery yields lower mortality in patients
with diabetes older than 65 years<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The controversy over the therapeutic option for the elderly is evident when assessing
the result of two studies performed in patients older than 75 years with coronary artery
disease. The Italian Elderly Acute Coronary Syndrome Trial Investigators has compared
the survival of patients treated with an early invasive approach <italic>versus</italic>
the clinical conservative approach, evidencing no advantage of the initial aggressive
therapy<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Another recent study
with patients diagnosed with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome has estimated the
presence of events (mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, re-hospitalization due to
cardiovascular cause, or bleeding) in the invasive treatment (86/182&#xA0;patients; 47.3%
females) as compared with that in the conservative approach (70/131 patients; 53.4%
females). That study has shown those events in 24.7% of the patients undergoing early
invasive therapy (45/182&#xA0;patients) as compared to 40.5% (53/131 patients) of those
undergoing the initial conservative treatment in a one-year follow-up. The patients
undergoing invasive treatment had an improvement in survival with a reduction in
death/nonfatal infarction (14.3% or 26 patients) and in new hospitalizations (9.9% or 18
patients) as compared to those undergoing conservative treatment (27.5% or 36&#xA0;patients,
and 16.8% or 22 patients, respectively)<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>It is worth noting that, although stents efficiently reestablish the vascular lumen by
reducing 50% of the angiographic restenosis, they cause injure to the vascular wall,
and, via repairing mechanisms, a healing response that, depending on the severity of the
process, will lead to reobstruction of the vessel treated. The analysis of the
composition of 40 coronary thrombi manually aspirated in the first 4 to 16.5 hours from
chest pain onset, during primary percutaneous coronary intervention, has identified the
presence of fibrin (49.1%), red blood cells (24.2%), platelets (11.6%) and leukocytes
(3.7%) in the material studied<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>According to Montalescot et al., although current interventional treatments reduce the
risk of restenosis by as much as 40% as compared to previous techniques, the
introduction of conventional stent has not improved survival as compared to balloon
angioplasty<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. In addition, the
use of drug-eluting stents has not improved survival as compared to conventional
stents<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The patient underwent new percutaneous coronary intervention with coronary stenting in
the anterior interventricular artery and balloon angioplasty in the first branch of the
diagonal artery, and had immediate and late, local and systemic complications of the
procedure (bleeding at the puncture site with pseudoaneurysm formation in the left
femoral artery and venous thrombosis in the left upper limb).</p>
      <p>The acute drop in hemoglobin after the percutaneous intervention (the seventh
procedure), as well as stent implantation with evidence of macrocytosis and elevation of
the MCV can be associated with excessive regeneration of bone marrow or with altered DNA
synthesis, probably related to post-hemorrhage anemia. The presence of leukocytosis with
36% of band neutrophils can be explained as stimulation by the inflammatory process,
trauma or necrosis with release of interleukin-1, mobilization of the bone marrow
reserve pool of band neutrophils and &#x201C;shift to the left&#x201D;. The absence of neutrophilia
can be explained by the patient&#x2019;s age group, suggesting the possibility of an infectious
process.</p>
      <p>Analyzing the laboratory tests, the increase in serum creatinine with a reduction in
glomerular filtration (19&#xA0;mL/min/1.73&#xA0;m<sup>2</sup>) and rapid progression with
elevation in aminotransferases suggest renal injury with severe renal failure and acute
liver failure due to ischemia/hypoxia and prolonged hypotension.</p>
      <p>It is worth noting that, although the two sequential measurements of troponin (0.126
ng/mL and 1.22 ng/mL) performed at a 24-hour interval were within the normal range, a
significant increase in the second value was observed, which can suggest an increased
cardiovascular risk. That risk was confirmed in a study with 2285 patients diagnosed
with stable coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus (female sex, 34.9%; age range,
55 to 68 years; mean age, 61 years), and followed up for five years<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Cardiovascular death, non-fatal acute
myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke occurred in 12.9% (178/1388 patients) of those
with normal troponin as compared to 27.1% (243/897 patients) of those with elevated
troponin. An elevation in troponin concentration greater than 25% in a four-year
follow-up proved to be an independent marker of cardiovascular risk<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The patient had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and developed
hemodynamic instability, respiratory instability and cardiac arrest after amiodarone
intravenous infusion. Although the clinical experience confirms the efficacy of
amiodarone to reverse atrial fibrillation in 80% of the cases, it should be carefully
used in elderly patients, with special attention paid to its infusion velocity. Two
authors have assessed the incidence of atrial fibrillation and the survival of patients
with that arrhythmia. Reinel et al. have studied 310 episodes of arrhythmia in 133
severely ill patients, 29.8% of which (83/278 episodes of tachycardia) represented
atrial fibrillation. Baine et al. have studied the incidence of types of arrhythmia in
patients (144512) older than 65 years, atrial fibrillation being the most frequently
found cardiac rhythm (44.8%)<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. In
another study of 4060 patients with atrial fibrillation and mean age of 69.7 years
(range, 60.7 &#x2013; 78.7), the mortality of those with controlled cardiac rhythm was 17.5%
(356/2033 patients) as compared to 15.3% (310/2027 patients) among those with controlled
heart rate<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The fourth point of interest was the patient&#x2019;s sudden clinical deterioration, suggesting
the release of mediators, causing hypoxemia and hypotension requiring the differential
diagnosis between sepsis and pulmonary thromboembolism. The rapid course with cardiac
arrhythmia, hypotension, severe hypoxemia and cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical
activity can be associated with massive pulmonary embolism<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. A study has confirmed that 79% of the patients with
pulmonary embolism had evidence of deep venous thrombosis of the lower limbs, and, of
the hereditary or acquired risk factors, advanced age and antiphospholipid antibody
syndrome increased the likelihood of acute episodes of repeated deep venous thrombosis
and pulmonary embolism<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The cause of death was pulmonary thromboembolism. The patient with chronic coronary
artery disease and several cardiovascular risk factors, such as arterial hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia and diabetes mellitus, showed progressive coronary atherogenesis.
In one decade, she had repeated episodes of vascular thrombosis, the last thromboembolic
event occurring at an uncommon site (upper limb), suggesting the need for thrombophilia
assessment. The patient had cardiac arrhythmia, hemodynamic instability and refractory
cardiogenic shock probably due to massive pulmonary embolism, and died. <bold>(Magaly

      <p>The heart weighed 453&#xA0;g (normal for the female sex: up to 350&#xA0;g). Its opening revealed
hypertrophy of the left ventricular walls and mottled aspect of the ventricular septum
myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Figure 4</xref>). On microscopic examination,
the mottled area corresponded to 2-to-3-week-old myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Figure 5</xref>). Fibrotic or scarring foci and focal areas
of extracellular amorphous substance accumulation with staining characteristics of
amyloid (Congo red) were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f06">Figure 6</xref>).
The microscopic study of the coronary arteries revealed recent partial thrombosis on the
seventh cm of the right coronary artery, in addition to atherosclerosis with 80%
obstruction. The anterior interventricular and circumflex branches of the left coronary
artery had stents placed several years before and were submitted to special processing
with resin inclusion, allowing for histological sections. These sections showed fibrous
(anterior interventricular branch) or fatty (circumflex branch) atherosclerotic plaques
in the coronary arteries causing in-stent occlusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f07">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f08">8</xref>).</p>

      <p>Coronary arteries submitted to stent implantation can develop late in-stent restenosis,
due to neoatherosclerosis, which happened in the case reported. The resin inclusion
technique allowed for sectioning and assessing the stented coronary segments. There were
atherosclerotic plaques of varied composition (fibrous and fatty). That obstruction
accounted for the recent septal infarction. Despite the occlusive lesions in the right
coronary artery, which was not the dominant vessel in this case, no infarction was
identified in that coronary artery territory.</p>
      <p>A very recent study by Taniwaki et al.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> has shown that in-stent neoatherosclerosis was more frequently found
in patients with clinical and angiographic evidence of atherosclerosis progression in
nontreated native coronary segments. Cardiovascular amyloidosis was an occasional
finding, and, although not extensive, it might have contributed to the final myocardial
dysfunction.</p>
      <p>The lungs showed focal alveolar edema and terminal bronchopneumonia. The source of the
septic thromboemboli was not identified. The gross examination of the heart evidenced no
signs of infectious endocarditis that could explain that embolic event. According to
clinical data, there were clinical signs of venous thrombosis of the left upper limb,
which, if infected, could have been the embolic source. Usually the exposed areas are
not inspected on the postmortem examination, explaining why that thrombosis was not
studied. <bold>(Vera Demarchi Aiello, Prof. MD)</bold></p>
