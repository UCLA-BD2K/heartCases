      <abstract>
        <p>Anterior plagiocephaly is a craniofacial anomaly related to
premature unilateral synostosis. We present three cases of anterior
plagiocephaly with contralateral superior oblique dysfunction. A
detailed ophthalmic examination, including orthoptic assessment
for the extraocular muscle misalignment, with appropriate radio-
imaging was done in all the three cases. All of them showed a
right-sided plagiocephaly, with overaction of the left superior
oblique muscle, alternating exotropia and a dissociated vertical
deviation. Two underwent surgical correction of squint. Both
were well aligned after squint surgery. Plagiocephaly has been
reported to simulate superior oblique muscle paresis. We report
a rare occurrence of contralateral superior oblique muscle
overaction in three children with anterior plagiocephaly.</p>

    <p>Plagiocephaly involves the unilateral premature fusion of the
coronal suture during the intrauterine development. Unilateral
coronal suture stenosis provokes a shortening of the orbital
roof on one side.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Plagiocephaly is known to be associated with
ipsilateral overaction of inferior obliques.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
Retrusion of the trochlea leads to desagittalization of the reflected tendinous
segment of the superior oblique. This reduces the effective
length of the superior oblique but also reduces the infraducting
vector of the latter.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> However, contralateral superior oblique
dysfunction has not been reported. We report three cases of
right-sided plagiocephaly with ipsilateral superior oblique
underaction and contralateral (left-sided) superior oblique
overaction.</p>

      <title>Case Reports</title>
      <sec>
        <title>Case 1</title>
        <p>A 12-year-old girl presented to us with complaints of squint
since childhood. She was a product of full-term caesarean
delivery with normal birth weight.</p>
        <p>Visual acuity in both eyes was 20/20 unaided. Ocular motility
examination showed left eye exotropia with superior oblique
overaction in the left eye. She had right-sided inferior oblique
overaction [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1A">1a</xref>]. In primary position, she measured fixing
right eye 18 prism diopters (pd) with left hypotropia 8 pd with
superior rectus overaction in primary position [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. An
A pattern of 15 pd was noted along with dissociated vertical
deviation (DVD). No hemifacial hypoplasia was noted.</p>
        <p>The flattening of frontal bone on the right side was noted
[Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1B">1b</xref>] and a computed tomography (CT) scan was ordered
which revealed a right-sided frontal plagiocephaly. The child
had undergone CT scan when she was two years old and that
too showed right-sided frontal plagiocephaly [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1C">1c</xref>]. A
diagnosis of alternate exotropia with left superior oblique
overaction with DVD was made. A forced duction test was
done on table and was negative in the left eye.</p>
        <p>Patient underwent left eye lateral rectus recession (9
mm) with posterior tenectomy of the superior oblique.
Postoperatively, patient had minimal exotropia with no
superior oblique overaction [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1C">1c</xref>], with no significant
pattern. The DVD persisted postoperatively too.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Case 2</title>
        <p>A 15-year-old boy presented to us with complains of squinting
since childhood. He was a full-term normal delivery, with no
history of birth trauma and a birth weight of 2.8 kg. There was
no family history of squint. His best corrected visual acuity was
20/20 in right eye and 20/60 in left eye [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. There was a
right-sided plagiocephaly with a head tilt to left [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2A">Figure 2a</xref>].</p>
        <p>Ocular motility examination revealed left exotropia of 35 pd
for near and 25 pd for distance with left hypotropia of 10 pd
[<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. He had a right superior rectus overaction, left superior
oblique overaction and an A pattern of 16 pd. Patient also
had DVD. A diagnosis of left exotropia with superior oblique
overaction, A pattern and DVD was made [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2B">2b</xref>]. Forced
duction test was negative for left superior oblique.</p>
        <p>Patient underwent a left eye lateral rectus recession (6.5 mm)
and medial rectus resection (4.0 mm) procedure with posterior
tenectomy of superior oblique in the left eye. Patient was well
aligned in primary position postoperatively. However, left
superior oblique showed mild overaction but no significant
pattern and the DVD persisted postoperatively [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2C">2c</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Case 3</title>
        <p>A 17-year-old girl presented to us with complaints of watering
since one month. She was a full-term normal delivery with no
history of birth trauma, with birth weight of 2.6 kg. There was
no family history of squint. Her best corrected visual acuity
was 20/20 in right eye and 20/80 in left eye [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. She had
a head tilt to the left.</p>
        <p>Ocular motility examination revealed left exotropia of 40 pd
for near and distance with left hypotropia of 10 pd [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. She
had a left superior oblique overaction and an A pattern of 14 pd
[Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3A">3 a</xref>]. She also had DVD. She had a right-sided frontal
plagiocephaly [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3B">3 b</xref>]. A diagnosis of left exotropia with
right superior rectus overaction, superior oblique overaction,
A pattern and DVD was made. She did not want to undergo
any surgical intervention.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Superior oblique underaction due to plagiocephaly secondary
to desagittalization has been well documented in literature.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
Diamond <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> found that 11 (32.3%) out of 34 children with
plagiocephaly had some form of strabismus. However, only
one (2.9%) had inferior oblique overaction and one (2.9%) had
superior oblique underaction. The presence of such superior
oblique dysfunction with plagiocephaly is rare.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></p>
      <p>Various theories have been advanced to explain this peculiar
motility abnormality. Desagittalization of superior oblique
makes it weaker in adduction compared to its antagonist
(inferior oblique). The effective length of the superior oblique
shortens and hence, makes it weaker in adduction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></p>
      <p>Greenberg <italic>et al</italic>., renamed ocular torticollis with skull and
facial symmetry as ocular plagiocephaly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> and noted that
unilateral superior oblique palsy can give rise to such facial
asymmetry. Stevens <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> in a recent review suggested that
deformational plagiocephaly is indeed distinctively different
from the facial hemihypoplasia noted in congenital superior
oblique palsy. They suggested that the characteristic facial
hemihypoplasia associated with superior oblique palsy
develops secondary to gravitational changes and not due to
deformational changes. Weiss <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> reported an imbalance of
muscle-pulling forces due to superolateral translation of the
superior rectus muscle pulley. They believe that this better
accounts for the hypertropia than posterior displacement of
the trochlea.</p>
      <p>All our cases have right-sided plagiocephaly and left-sided
(contralateral) superior oblique overaction. The surgical
decision should be considered as the surgeon&#x2032;s personal choice
and not as a standard surgery for such cases. Unilateral superior
palsy may give rise to contralateral superior oblique overaction
secondary to ipsilateral superior rectus contracture.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
This could well be the explanation for both our cases having right-
sided superior oblique weakness secondary to right-sided
plagiocephaly. However, while this has been documented
for paralytic muscles, our cases were mainly underaction of
superior oblique secondary to a mechanical cause. Moreover,
none of our cases show any inferior oblique overaction,
which should be present. Another possibility could be a rare
right-sided plagiocephaly with contralateral inferior oblique
paresis giving rise to such incomitance. Two cases underwent a
unilateral recession resection surgery with posterior tenectomy
of the superior oblique. The cosmetic alignment was good in
primary position. Posterior tenectomy of superior oblique is
an accepted procedure for moderate A pattern with superior
oblique overaction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> Superior oblique tenotomy could have
been disastrous, as the patient might have landed in a bilateral
superior oblique underaction scenario. Right-sided inferior
oblique was not recessed since the patient did not show any
significant inferior oblique overaction. However, ipsilateral
weakening of superior rectus alone or with contralateral
superior oblique weakening could also be tried.</p>
      <p>We believe that contralateral superior oblique may show
overaction in cases of plagiocephaly, secondary to the underaction
of the ipsilateral superior oblique. Though contralateral superior
oblique overaction could be secondary to unilateral superior
oblique palsy, we believe that this could also occur in cases of
plagiocephaly where the superior oblique dysfunction may be
secondary. Importantly, this type of superior oblique overaction
may be tackled in appropriate cases which may otherwise be
contraindicated in congenital superior oblique palsies.</p>
