      <p>A 77-year-old man with a previous history of coronary heart disease, depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%, and permanent atrial fibrillation was referred for decompensated heart failure. A radiofrequency ablation of the atrioventricular junction had been performed because of an uncontrolled high ventricular rate, with implantation of a single-chamber pacemaker with a bipolar lead screwed in the right ventricular apex (ARV, <italic>Panel A</italic>). Despite optimal medical therapy, he had then been hospitalized several times for congestive heart failure. A biventricular pacemaker had finally been implanted, with an additional unipolar left ventricular lead placed in a posterior-lateral vein. Despite a permanent and optimized biventricular pacing, the patient remained very symptomatic (6-min hall walk test, 110 m), with wide QRS complexes (160 ms) and an LVEF of 30%. Echocardiography showed the persistence of a significant intra-left ventricular dyssynchrony.</p>
      <p>Two novel pacing leads were then implanted: a bipolar lead screwed in the interventricular septum; a bipolar lead placed via the coronary sinus in an anterior-lateral vein. The two right leads were connected to the right ventricular port through a bipolar Y-connector; the left ventricular anterior-lateral lead was connected to the atrium port; the left ventricular posterior-lateral lead was connected to the left ventricular port. The device (Biotronik Stratos, Berlin, Germany) was programmed in DDDR mode with a minimum atrioventricular delay (15 ms) and no interventricular delay (0 ms), in order to obtain as narrowest QRS complexes as possible (110 ms, <italic>Panel B</italic>).</p>
      <p>Nine months after upgrading to quadruple-site pacing, the patient was free from any hospitalization. His clinical status had dramatically improved (6-min hall walk test, 390 m). Echocardiography showed reverse left ventricular remodelling with an increased LVEF of 40%. Three-dimensional speckle-tracking showed a complete left ventricular mechanical resynchronization with simultaneous systolic peaks of the different left ventricular regions (<italic>Panel C</italic>).</p>
