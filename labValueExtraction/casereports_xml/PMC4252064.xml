      <abstract>
        <p>Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, the primary manifestations of which are poor growth and neurologic abnormality. Mutations of the <italic>ERCC6</italic> and <italic>ERCC8</italic> genes are the predominant cause of Cockayne syndrome, and the <italic>ERCC6</italic> gene mutation is present in approximately 65% of cases. The present report describes a case of Cockayne syndrome in a Chinese family, with the patients carrying two missense mutations (c.1595A&gt;G, p.Asp532Gly and c.1607T&gt;G, p.Leu536Trp) in the <italic>ERCC6</italic> gene in an apparently compound heterozygote status, especially, p.Asp532Gly has never been reported. The compound heterozygote mutation was found in three patients in the family using whole exome sequencing. The patients&#x2019; father and mother carried a heterozygous allele at different locations of the <italic>ERCC6</italic> gene, which was confirmed by Sanger DNA sequencing. The two mutations are both located in the highly conserved motif I of ATP-binding helicase and are considered &#x201C;Damaging,&#x201D; &#x201C;Probably Damaging,&#x201D; &#x201C;Disease Causing,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Conserved&#x201D;, indicating the role of DNA damage in the pathogenetic process of the disease. The results not only enrich the <italic>ERCC6</italic> mutations database, but also indicate that whole exome sequencing will be a powerful tool for discovering the disease causing mutations in clinical diagnosis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cockayne syndrome (CS; MIM 216400, 133540) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive growth failure, microcephaly, mental retardation, retinal pigmentary degeneration, deafness, photosensitivity, accelerated systemic degeneration of somatic tissue and premature death. Cockayne syndrome spans a phenotypic spectrum that includes CS type I, CS type II, CS type III, and Xeroderma pigmentosum-Cockayne syndrome (XP-CS). Due to the wide clinical variability, the diagnosis of this disorder is quite difficult during early stages. Molecular genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis. Mutations in the <italic>ERCC6</italic> and <italic>ERCC8</italic> genes are known to cause Cockayne syndrome <xref rid="pone.0113914-Nance1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0113914-Pasquier1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and approximately 65% individuals with CS have mutations in the <italic>ERCC6</italic> gene <xref rid="pone.0113914-Laugel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The <italic>ERCC6</italic> gene is located on chromosome 10q11.23, encoding a protein belonging to the SWI2/SNF2 family that contains an acidic domain, a glycine-rich region, two putative nuclear localized signal sequences, and seven characteristic helicase ATPase domains. It is part of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, a complex system that eliminates a broad spectrum of structural DNA lesions, including ultraviolet (UV)-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, bulky chemical adducts, and DNA cross-links. One of the NER pathways preferentially repairs lesions on the transcribed strand of active genes; this process occurs more rapidly than repairs on nontranscribed strands, which is part of overall genome repair <xref rid="pone.0113914-Troelstra1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The present study reports two <italic>ERCC6</italic> mutations identified by whole exome sequencing in three individuals with Cockayne syndrome from a Chinese family. The two missense mutations are c.1595A&gt;G and c.1607T&gt;G, which are located in exon 7 of the <italic>ERCC6</italic> gene, and the c.1595A&gt;G has never been reported.</p>

        <title>Clinical report</title>
        <p>The three affected individuals with Cockayne syndrome are sisters from a Chinese family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113914-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Their parents are nonconsanguineous and healthy. The three sisters were all born at full-term by vaginal delivery and had no abnormalities at birth. They had similar clinical features including postnatal growth failure, severe and progressive neurological deterioration, cachexia, and photosensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113914-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The major clinical manifestations of the three sisters are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0113914-t001">Table 1</xref>. The results of laboratory tests for the proband (II1) were as follows: normal karyotype (46, XX); no subtelomeric duplications or deletions in any chromosomes, as detected by P036 and P070 Multiplex Ligation Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) kits (MRC-Holland, Netherlands); no microdeletion syndromes, as detected with a P245 MLPA kit (MRC-Holland, Netherlands); absence of clinically significant microdeletions and microduplications, as detected using a Array-CGH (Comparative genomic hybridization) Agilent 180K chip (Agilent, USA); and no inherited metabolic diseases, as detected by tandem mass spectrometric analysis. The cerebra MR imaging for the proband showed signs of hypomyelination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113914-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The brain CT scan showed that calcification on bilateral globus pallidus, cerebral atrophy (widened sulcus and cleft, enlarged superatentorial ventricle, narrowed gyrus) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113914-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>

        <p>We sequenced the exome of three affected individuals from the same family (Samples II:1, II:2 and II:3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113914-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). We generated an average of 103.52 million reads of sequence with 128.87-fold average coverage for all affected individuals as paired-end, 90 bp reads. Approximately 99.22% of the reads passed the quality assessment and aligned to the human reference genome 19, and approximately 98.9% of the targeted bases were sufficiently covered to pass our thresholds for calling SNPs and InDels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113914.s001">Table S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>According to the criteria mentioned above, we detected more than 80 thousand variants in each patient. After filtering for 364 candidate genes that are related to mental and psychomotor retardation, over 1600 variants were identified in each person. Next, we focused on nonsynonymous (NS) variants, splice acceptor and donor site mutations (SS) and coding indels (Indel) that were relatively more likely to be pathogenic mutations. Because CS is a rare disorder, the causative variants will occur at a very low frequency in the general population. Therefore, we compared the NS/SS/Indel variants against the dbSNP137, HapMap, 1000 human genome dataset and a local database of 100 Chinese healthy adults, and removed the shared SNPs. Given that these patients are related and that they are expected to share the causal variant for CS, we filtered all the detected variations in these patients against each other and found 7 shared variants. And due to the CS in this family is an autosomal recessive inherited disease, we found two SNPs are consistent with AR inherited mode (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113914.s002">Table S2</xref>). The two SNPs (c.1595A&gt;G, p.Asp532Gly and c.1607T&gt;G, p.Leu536Trp) were compound heterozygous in all three sisters and were located in exon 7 of the <italic>ERCC6</italic> gene, which is related to the CS status.</p>

The co-segregation analysis in this family indicated that the c.1607T&gt;G (p.Leu536Trp) missense mutation was inherited from the unaffected father, and the other mutation (c.1595A&gt;G, p.Asp532Gly) inherited from unaffected mother, consistent with the phenotype of this family. The results showed complete consistency between the exome sequencing and the Sanger sequencing, suggesting that exome sequencing provides high accuracy and can be applied to the analysis of clinical samples.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Cockayne&#x2019;s syndrome (CS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that results in postnatal growth failure, microcephaly, sensorial impairment, cutaneous photosensitivity, recognizable facial appearance with deep sunken eyes and progressive neurologic dysfunction, most symptoms appear and worsen with time. This disorder is classified as a segmental progeria that arises due to a mutation in <italic>ERCC8</italic> and <italic>ERCC6</italic>. In previous studies, short insertions and deletions, nonsense mutations, splice mutations, missense mutations and promoter mutation have all been implicated in Cockayne&#x2019;s syndrome, and among the 84 reported cases up to 2009, approximate 65% had mutations in the <italic>ERCC6</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0113914-Laugel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113914-Mallery1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. A classic Cockayne&#x2019;s syndrome case has been reported carrying a novel homozygous nonsense mutation c.1387C&gt;T/Q463X in the <italic>ERCC6</italic> gene <xref rid="pone.0113914-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Another report identified two novel <italic>ERCC6</italic> mutations (a splice-site mutation, c.2709+1G&gt;T, in intron 14 and a short deletion in exon 5 (c.1293_1320del) in an Amish individual with Cockayne&#x2019;s syndrome <xref rid="pone.0113914-Xin1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we performed exome sequencing for genetic testing of three sisters with postnatal growth failure and neurological impairment using the Hiseq2000 platform. After exome sequencing analysis and criteria filtering, we identified two missense mutations in the <italic>ERCC6</italic> gene in the three affected sisters. The c.1595A&gt;G missense mutation results in the substitution of aspartic acid (D) for glycine (G) at residue 532,which has never been reported. The c.1607T&gt;G missense mutation results in the substitution of leucine (L) for tryptophan (W) at residue 536 that had been recorded but no details <xref rid="pone.0113914-Laugel2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The Sanger sequencing and co-segregation analysis in this family indicated that the compound heterozygous c.1595A&gt;G and c.1607T&gt;G mutations in the three affected sisters were inherited from their unaffected father and mother, respectively, consistent with the phenotypes of these family members. Additionally, the c.1595A&gt;G missense mutation and the c.1607T&gt;G missense mutation are predicted to be &#x201C;Damaging&#x201D; and &#x201C;Probably damaging&#x201D;, respectively, by SIFT and PolyPhen-2, and both are located in the highly conserved motif I of ATP-binding helicase.</p>
      <p>The <italic>ERCC6</italic> gene encompasses 21 exons and yields an 8993 bp transcript that encodes the 1493aa CSB protein. It is a component of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, a complex system that eliminates a broad spectrum of structural DNA lesions, including ultraviolet (UV)-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, bulky chemical adducts, and DNA cross-links <xref rid="pone.0113914-ProiettiDeSantis1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113914-VlezCruz1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The cellular roles played by the CSB protein in repair, transcription, chromatin remodeling and apoptosis may be mediated by distinct functional domains of the protein <xref rid="pone.0113914-Muftuoglu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The conserved helicase ATPase has been shown to be an essential functional domain of the CSB protein in responding to UV-induced DNA damage in previous studies <xref rid="pone.0113914-Brosh1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0113914-Cho1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Furthermore, other studies have suggested that the recruitment of CSB to lesion-stalled transcription and chromatin remodeling is an ATP-dependent process <xref rid="pone.0113914-Lake1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Evidence indicates that the integrity of the motif I and II are important for CSB function. A point mutation in ATPase motif I of CSB rendered the protein totally defective in ATP hydrolysis, but it was still able to partially rescue the delay in RNA synthesis recovery after exposure to UV light when microinjected into an immortalized human CS-B fibroblast cell line <xref rid="pone.0113914-Citterio1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. A point mutation in motif II of the ATPase domain completely abolished the ability of CSB to function in survival, RNA synthesis recovery, gene-specific repair and apoptosis upon UV irradiation in hamster and human cells <xref rid="pone.0113914-Brosh2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113914-Selzer2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. And other study demonstrated the point mutations in ATPase motif Ia, III, V and VI also abolished the genetic function of the CSB protein in survival, RNA synthesis recovery and apoptosis after UV treatment <xref rid="pone.0113914-Muftuoglu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Therefore, the two missense mutations, D532G and L536W, located in the motif I of ATP-Binding domain loss of ATP hydrolysis and then fail to repair the DNA damage which maybe the pathogenic reason of the three sisters.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have described three Chinese sisters with Cockayne&#x2019;s syndrome. Exome sequencing was performed, identifying two missense mutations p.Asp532Gly that is never been reported andp.Leu536Trp in the <italic>ERCC6</italic> gene. The results not only enrich the known mutation spectrum of this DNA repair disorder, but also indicate that whole exome sequencing will be a powerful tool for discovering the disease causing mutations in clinical diagnosis.</p>
