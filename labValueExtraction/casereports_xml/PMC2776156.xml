        <p>Jeune syndrome (asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, ATD) is a rare autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia characterized by a small, narrow chest and variable limb shortness with a considerable neonatal mortality as a result of respiratory distress. Renal, hepatic, pancreatic and ocular complications may occur later in life. We describe 13 cases with ages ranging from 9&#xA0;months to 22&#xA0;years. Most patients experienced respiratory problems in the first years of their life, three died, one experienced renal complications, and one had hepatic problems. With age, the thoracic malformation tends to become less pronounced and the respiratory problems decrease. The prognosis of ATD seems better than described in literature and in our opinion this justifies long term intensive treatment in the first years. We also propose a follow-up protocol for patients with ATD.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD; OMIM 208500), also known as Jeune syndrome, is a rare autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia with multi-organ involvement. It was first described in 1955 by Jeune et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Diagnosis is based on clinical and radiographic findings. Clinically, ATD is characterized by a small, narrow chest and variable limb shortness. Associated congenital abnormalities are postaxial polydactyly of both hands and/or feet (20%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Typical radiographic findings include a narrow, bell-shaped thorax with short, horizontally oriented ribs and irregular costochondral junctions, elevated clavicles, short iliac bones with a typical trident appearance of the acetabula, relatively short and wide long bones of the extremities, and hypoplastic phalanges of both hands and feet with cone-shaped epiphyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The small, narrow thorax often results in respiratory distress and recurrent respiratory infections in the neonatal period and infancy. Often (60&#x2013;80%), the outcome of ATD is said to be fatal in early childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Patients surviving infancy may develop progressive renal failure later in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Liver, pancreas and retinal abnormalities have also been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Treatment of ATD is symptomatic. The thoracic malformation tends to become less severe with age, resulting in less respiratory problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The inheritance of ATD is autosomal recessive. A locus has been identified on chromosome 15q13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], while recently, mutations were found in the <italic>IFT80</italic> gene, encoding an intraflagellar protein, in a small subset of ATD patients, who did not have extraskeletal manifestations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Antenatal examination is possible by ultrasound, but the precise diagnosis is very difficult or impossible. Key factors in the prenatal diagnosis are an abnormal small thorax, short limbs, polyhydramnios, and unidentifiable fetal respiratory movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this article, we describe 13 patients with ATD and we propose a follow-up protocol.</p>

        <title>Patients</title>
        <p>We included all patients diagnosed with ATD at the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre in Nijmegen. Diagnoses were based on the presence of clinical findings, like a small, narrow chest and variable limb shortness and radiographic findings, like narrow, bell-shaped thorax with short, horizontally oriented ribs, irregular costochondral junctions and elevated clavicles, short iliac bones with a typical trident appearance of the acetabula, and if available, relatively short and wide long bones of the extremities and hypoplastic phalanges of both hands and feet. We identified 13 patients from 11 families, five females and eight males, ages ranging from 9&#xA0;months to 22&#xA0;years, of who three died. Hospital charts were reviewed retrospectively. Data collected from these charts included information about hospital admissions, lung function tests, laboratory data and radiographic findings. All 11 living patients (case 13 died at the end of the study) were examined using the same protocol consisting of physical examination, including several anthropometric measurements, chest radiograph, abdominal ultrasound, spirometry, expert ophthalmic examination and blood and 24&#xA0;h collected urine analysis. A summary of the clinical and radiographic data is given in Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. In all probands except case 9 and 13, <italic>IFT80</italic> mutation analysis was performed.

        <title>Case 1</title>
        <p>Female, 22&#xA0;years old, the first born to healthy, unrelated Dutch parents. She has one healthy sibling. At the age of 1&#xA0;year she was evaluated because of growth failure, abnormal chest shape and limb shortness. Skeletal radiographs showed a small, narrow thorax, brachydactyly of the fingers, short and broad diaphyses, and wide metaphyses of the arms and legs, and short iliac bones with spiky protrusions. There was no history of respiratory difficulties. At 3&#xA0;years of age she was admitted because of a respiratory infection. Blood gas revealed a metabolic acidose, serum creatinine was elevated, urinalysis showed proteinuria and her blood pressure was 200/170&#xA0;mmHg. Her renal function deteriorated (serum creatinine 422&#xA0;&#x3BC;mol/l, ureum 16.8&#xA0;mmol/l) and at the age of 4&#xA0;years CAPD was started. A renal transplant was performed when she was 5&#xA0;years old and 5&#xA0;weeks later bilateral nephrectomy was performed because of persistent hypertension. At the age of 12&#xA0;years she developed progressive renal failure, as a result of chronic rejection, and she was transplanted for a second time. Until now, her renal function remained stable. Ophthalmic examination showed narrow blood vessels without clinical problems. At the age of 22&#xA0;years she is living independently and working as a nurse with mildly impaired exercise tolerance. Physical examination at the age of 22&#xA0;years showed a height below the third centile, a sitting height/height ratio above the 97th centile, a chest circumference below the third centile, a hand length below the third centile and a foot length below the third centile. The chest radiograph showed an abnormal position of both ribs and claviculae with a CTR of 0.53 (reference&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.50; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]). Pathological examination of the native kidneys showed that most of the glomeruli were totally sclerotic and the remainder showed capillary collapse. Periglomular fibrosis, tubular atrophy and dilatation with interstitial lymphocyte infiltration were seen.</p>

        <title>Case 2</title>
        <p>Female, 19&#xA0;years old, born at term as the third of five children to healthy consanguineous (second cousins) Dutch parents. Birth weight was 3,880&#xA0;g (75&#x2013;90th centile). Physical examination revealed a narrow chest and her liver was palpated 5&#xA0;cm below the right costal margin. Intubation was necessary because of severe respiratory distress and she was ventilated for a month. During that time, she had several respiratory infections. Skeletal radiographs showed short ribs, short iliac bones with a typical trident appearance of the acetabular margins, and mildly shortened humeral bones. Cardiac ultrasound, ophthalmic examination, and repeated abdominal ultrasound revealed no abnormalities. At the age of 19&#xA0;years, she has a normal exercise tolerance and she is working as a nurse. Physical examination at the age of 19&#xA0;years showed a height below the third centile, a sitting height/height ratio on the 97th centile, a chest circumference on the 25th centile and a hand and foot length below the third centile. The chest radiograph showed a narrow thorax with elevated clavicles and a CTR of 0.48.</p>

        <title>Case 3</title>
        <p>Female, 13&#xA0;years old, sister of case 2, born at term as the last and fifth child. At birth, her weight was 3,780&#xA0;g (75&#x2013;90th centile). Physical examination revealed a narrow chest and short extremities. Immediately after birth, she suffered from severe respiratory distress; she was intubated and ventilated for 2&#xA0;weeks. Skeletal radiographs showed a narrow thorax with a CTR of 0.64, short ribs with bulbous ends, a typical trident appearance of the acetabular margins and apparently normal bones of arms and legs. Ophthalmic examination and abdominal ultrasound revealed no abnormalities. During her first year, she was readmitted several times because of respiratory exacerbation during respiratory infections. With diuretic therapy, her pulmonary condition stabilized. She needed supplementary oxygen for 6&#xA0;months. Diuretic therapy was continued until the age of 2&#xA0;years. At the age of 10&#xA0;years, she developed a slight scoliosis, for which she was treated with a brace. During routine follow-up at 12&#xA0;years of age elevated liver enzymes were found. Except for obesity there were no abnormal signs and symptoms. The liver was palpated 2&#xA0;cm below the right costal margin. Tests for EBV, CMV, hepatitis A, B, and polymerase chain reaction on hepatitis C were all negative. Antismooth muscle and antireticulum autoantibodies were not found. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a normal hepatic structure, normal biliary tract, and normal portal flow pattern. Because she was in good health, at that time no further diagnostic procedures were done. Follow-up ultrasonography after 1&#xA0;year revealed irregularly increased parenchymatous density. Liver and spleen were not enlarged and the abdomen was not painful on palpation. A liver biopsy revealed inflammation of the portal triangles, predominantly eosinophilic, and mild portoportal fibrosis without involvement of the bile canaliculi. Ursodeoxycholic acid was prescribed (600&#xA0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day).</p>
        <p>Her height was on the tenth centile, sitting height/height ratio above the 97th centile, chest circumference on the 75th centile, hand length on the 50th centile, and foot length between the 25th and 50th centile. The chest radiograph showed a narrow thorax with horizontally oriented clavicles, a short sternum and a CTR of 0.54.</p>

        <title>Case 4</title>
        <p>Male, 17&#xA0;years old, born at term as the second and last child to healthy, unrelated Dutch parents. His birth weight was 4,370&#xA0;g (&gt;97th centile). Physical examination revealed a small chest, but no other abnormalities. He was discharged the same day. He remained well for 4&#xA0;days, but then he developed respiratory distress and was readmitted. Skeletal radiographs showed a small, narrow thorax with short, broad ribs, a typical trident appearance of the acetabular margins and apparently normal bones of hand and arm. He was discharged at the age of 1&#xA0;month, oxygen dependent, which he remained for about 1&#x2013;2&#xA0;months after discharge. At the age of 6.5&#xA0;years his chest was surgically corrected, without any complications. At 14&#xA0;years of age, routine abdominal ultrasound showed a rounded mass in the pancreas (diameter 1&#xA0;cm). Magnetic Resonance cholangiopancreaticography (MRCP) with gadolinium enhancement showed a fluid-rich, hypovascular lesion of 1.0 by 1.2&#xA0;cm. During the following 3&#xA0;years there was no change in the diameter of the lesion. Ophthalmic examination showed no abnormalities. At the age of 17, he has a mildly impaired exercise tolerance. Physical examination at the age of 17&#xA0;years showed a height on the 50th centile, a sitting height/height ratio on the 97th centile, a chest circumference between the 50th and 75th centile, a hand length between the 75th and 97th centile and a foot length above the 97th centile. The chest radiographs showed a thoracic scoliosis and a CTR of 0.50.</p>

        <p>Male, 13&#xA0;years old, born at term by cesarean section because of an abnormal position, as the first of two children of healthy, unrelated Dutch parents. His birth weight was 2,885&#xA0;g (tenth centile). A narrow chest with minimal breathing movements and bilateral syndactyly of the second and third toes were seen. Skeletal radiographs showed a narrow thorax with short, horizontally oriented ribs, an abnormal pelvic configuration with short iliac bones with spurlike protrusions and short metacarpals and distal phalanges. Ophthalmic examination and abdominal ultrasound revealed no abnormalities. He experienced no severe respiratory problems during infancy and childhood. At the age of 13, he is doing well in school (secondary education) and he has a normal exercise tolerance. Physical examination at the age of 13&#xA0;years showed a height between the 25th and 50th centile, a sitting height/height ratio on the 90th centile, a chest circumference between the tenth and 25th centile, a hand length between the 25th and 50th centile and a foot length between the tenth and 25th centile. The chest radiograph showed a narrow thorax and a CTR of 0.50.</p>

        <p>Male, brother of case 6, born at term as the fifth and last child. Prenatal ultrasound at 20 and 21+&#x2009;5&#xA0;week gestational age showed short femora and a small thorax. At birth weight was 3,510&#xA0;g (25&#x2013;50th centile). A small, narrow chest was noted at birth. He was intubated because of severe respiratory distress. Radiographs showed a very hypoplastic thorax with an abnormal rib configuration, elevated and horizontally oriented clavicles, an abnormal pelvic configuration with a trident appearance of the acetabular margins, and prematurely ossified capital femoral epiphyseal centers. Ophthalmic examination was not performed. Laboratory data showed high levels of direct bilirubin and mildly elevated liver enzymes. Despite mechanical ventilation with high oxygen concentration he developed progressive hypoxemia and at 5&#xA0;weeks he died of respiratory insufficiency. At autopsy, a small thorax with short ribs and elevated clavicles was noted. The lungs were hypoplastic with atelectasis, interstitial fibrosis of the lungs and multiple signs of pulmonary hypertension. Microscopically, the liver revealed bile duct proliferation and portal tract fibrosis. Kidneys showed slight mesangial glomerular sclerosis. Ribs showed hyperplastic cartilage and hypoplastic bone trabecula.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (Jeune syndrome) is characterized by a small, narrow chest and variable limb shortness. The diagnosis is based on clinical and radiologic findings. All our patients fulfill the diagnostic criteria for ATD. The most consistent and characteristic findings were the abnormalities of the thorax and pelvis. The radiographic findings are so typical that distinction from other skeletal dysplasias, except Ellis&#x2013;van Creveld syndrome, is not difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In Ellis&#x2013;van Creveld syndrome the appearance of the pelvis is indistinguishable, but the involvement of the thorax is less pronounced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Characteristic for Ellis&#x2013;van Creveld syndrome are the ectodermal dysplasia, postaxial or axial polydactyly of the hands (constant feature) and sometimes feet, severe hypoplasia of fingers, slanting proximal tibial metaphyses, abnormal shape and size of the carpal bones, and heart defects in up to 50% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Renal failure is not seen in Ellis&#x2013;van Creveld syndrome. Ellis&#x2013;van Creveld syndrome is caused by mutations in the genes <italic>EVC1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> on chromosome 4p16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Several complications of ATD have been described in the literature. The respiratory problems are the main concern in ATD. A large percentage of the children with ATD die as a result of these problems. Percentages up to 80% have been mentioned in literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In our series, 11 of 13 cases experienced respiratory problems in the first 2&#xA0;years of their lives, and two died because of these. Another patient died at home at the age of 18&#xA0;months, but the cause of death was unknown. Ten out of 13 patients survived with varying degrees of medical support. Past the age of 2&#xA0;years, respiratory problems resolved except in cases 8 and 11, who still required oxygen. The thoracic malformation tends to become less pronounced with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A plausible explanation could be the improved mechanical properties of the chest wall with growth. The prognosis of children with ATD seems better than described in most articles due to improved intensive care modalities. It is unlikely that our series is biased towards milder cases since the regional NICU is in our hospital as are the regional prenatal diagnostic services and cases with <italic>IFT80</italic> mutations are not more severely affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. So it seems very worthwhile to treat these children with all means in order to overcome their first difficult years. Due to the thoracic malformation and the resulting lung hypoplasia most children maintained a restrictive lung function impairment, but only four of them suffer clinical problems. In the long term, patients seem to live a relatively normal life. In our series, the two oldest patients have normal jobs and normal social life. CTR was 0.50 or higher in nine of 11 patients; no relation was seen between CTR and the severity of respiratory problems. For aesthetic reasons, one patient had reconstructive surgery of his thorax, with a satisfying result. His lung function is still mildly restricted. Several surgical techniques have been described in literature with varying results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Renal complications are another complication seen in children with ATD. Usually renal problems do not appear until after the second year of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Characteristic are tubular disorders such as a concentrating defect, a defect in the phosphate- and urate resorption, and proteinuria. Predominant histological findings described in literature are: atrophic and cystic dilatation of the tubules, diffuse interstitial fibrosis, periglomerular fibrosis, and glomerular sclerosis (nephronophthisis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Up to now, only one of our patients (case 1) experienced renal insufficiency. Her kidneys showed the histological abnormalities described above. Autopsy in case 7 revealed slight mesangial glomerular sclerosis. Though renal problems are uncommon in this series of patients, in literature, percentages up to 30% have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Some of our patients are still young and renal problems might still develop later in life. Because renal complications tend to develop insidiously, renal function must be monitored regularly in patients with ATD. Since the first symptom of renal dysfunction often is a concentration defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] we recommend to monitor urine osmolality in first-voided urine in the morning and a desmopressine test if necessary. In the past occasionally, cases with ocular abnormalities have been described, usually retinitis pigmentosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The most characteristic and consistent finding on fundus examination has been described as a mid-peripheral zone of retinal pigment epithelial disturbance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This can be seen as early as 5&#xA0;years of age. Clinically, night blindness is the first symptom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. All surviving patients underwent expert ophthalmic examination to look for abnormalities and in particular retinitis pigmentosa. No abnormalities except narrow blood vessels in patient 1 were seen. Very frequent ophthalmic examination does not seem necessary. Hepatic abnormalities have primarily been reported on post mortem examinations and liver biopsy specimens. Clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction are quite infrequent. Vomiting, hyperbilirubinemia, elevated transaminases, hepatomegaly, and portal hypertension have all been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The most frequently reported histopathological abnormalities are bile duct proliferation at the periphery of portal tracts and fibrosis ranging from mild portal fibrosis to cirrhosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Liver pathology is more severe in older patients, suggesting that the histopathologic changes are progressive. However, the pathology findings in two patients of very different age in this series point to the variability of these changes. Routine laboratory examination in our population revealed elevated liver enzymes in only one patient. Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid was beneficial and reversed enzyme levels, as reported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], but the effect on the prognosis of liver disease remains uncertain. Enzyme elevations preceded changes seen on ultrasound. This suggests that for purposes of monitoring liver disease, routine follow-up of liver enzymes is more sensitive than ultrasonography. Pancreatic complications have rarely been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Some studies have described microscopic cystic changes in the pancreatic ducts and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is a rare complication in older patients with ATD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. An asymptomatic cystic lesion was found in case 4.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, ATD is a genetically heterogeneous multi-organ disease with variable expression, predominantly affecting the thoracic cage with respiratory complications as the main problem. Children often need respiratory assistance during their first years, but the respiratory problems decrease with age. The prognosis of ATD in our series seems better than described in literature and this justifies intensive treatment of respiratory complications in the first years of life.</p>
      <p>A proposed follow-up protocol for different age groups is given in Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. It is based on this retrospective study and the literature. Since it is a first attempt, we have remained at the safe side. Identifying co-morbidity is the main purpose of the follow-up. Since in the first 2&#xA0;years of life patients may experience severe respiratory problems, they should be seen frequently by a specialized pediatrician in a tertiary center. From the age of 2&#xA0;years, the frequency can be decreased, depending on the patient&#x2019;s clinical condition. Laboratory examination of urine and blood should be done twice a year during the first 2&#xA0;years and thereafter every year, abdominal ultrasound at ages 2, 5, 10, and 15&#xA0;years, spirometry every year from the age of 5&#xA0;years and ophthalmic examination at the age of 5 and 10&#xA0;years. Regularly, evaluation of this follow-up protocol based on prospective evaluation of cases is necessary for its fine tuning.
