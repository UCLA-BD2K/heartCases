      <abstract>
        <p>An 11-year-old Holstein-Friesian cow exhibited anorexia and jaundice. A large mass was
found in the liver during necropsy. Macroscopically, the mass was composed of dark red
multilobular tissue and a centrally located abscess, which was connected to the hepatic
duct. Histologically, the mass consisted of proliferation of small neoplastic cells and
was demarcated from the hepatic parenchyma by a thick region of granulation tissue. The
neoplastic cells were predominantly arranged in solid sheets, but they also formed
blood-filled cancellous structures, and proliferating foci were seen around blood vessels.
Periodic acid-Schiff reaction demonstrated that a fine basement membrane-like structure
surrounded the neoplastic cells. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells were positive
for vimentin and alpha smooth muscle actin and negative for cytokeratin, factor
VIII-related antigen, chromogranin and desmin. Based on its histopathological features,
the hepatic neoplasm was diagnosed as a primary glomus tumor. This is the first report
about a primary glomus tumor of the liver in a cow.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Glomus tumor is a mesenchymal neoplasm that originates in the neuromyoarterial glomus [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In humans,
most glomus tumors develop in the subungual region. However, they have also been reported to
affect the dermis, subcutis, nerves, stomach, nasal cavity and trachea. Similarly, a few
reports have indicated that primary glomus tumors can also occur in the liver [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In veterinary
medicine, glomus tumors have been reported to develop in the digits in dogs and cats [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the skin in dogs and horses [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and the urinary bladder in a cow [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Glomus tumors are typically benign, although malignant forms have been reported
[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To the
best of our knowledge, no cases of primary glomus tumor of the liver or of cholangitic
abscesses associated with tumors have been reported in animals.</p>
    <p>An 11-year-old Holstein-Friesian cow was admitted to the Animal Teaching Hospital at Obihiro
University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine with a chief clinical compliant of anorexia
without fever. The cow was suspected of having nephritis due to proteinuria, hematuria and
bacteriuria, which had not responded to several antimicrobial treatments. A physical
examination demonstrated yellow discoloration of the visible mucous membrane and reduced
ruminal motility. Blood chemistry tests detected severe hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin:
10.2 mg/d<italic>l</italic> [reference range: 0.01&#x2013;0.5 mg/d<italic>l</italic>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]], direct bilirubin: 5.1 mg/d<italic>l</italic>
[reference range: 0.04&#x2013;0.44 mg/d<italic>l</italic>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]], indirect bilirubin: 5.1 mg/d<italic>l</italic> [reference range: 0&#x2013;0.3
mg/d<italic>l</italic>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]]), markedly elevated
gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity (917 U/<italic>l</italic> [reference range: 15&#x2013;39
U/<italic>l</italic>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]]) and moderately increased
alkaline phosphatase activity (504 U/<italic>l</italic> [reference range: 0&#x2013;488
U/<italic>l</italic>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]]). These findings were
indicative of jaundice and a biliary tract disorder. Ultrasonographic imaging detected a solid
mass and an abscess-like structure in the cow&#x2019;s liver. A reduced albumin/globulin ratio and
leukocytosis (12,200/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic> [reference range:
4,900&#x2013;12,000/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]]) and
neutrophilia (9,760/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic> [reference range:
1,800&#x2013;6,300/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]])) were also
noted.</p>
    <p>The animal was euthanized via the administration of an overdose of potassium chloride under
deep barbiturate-induced anesthesia and underwent a necropsy 9 days after the first medical
examination. During a gross examination, the right and caudate lobes of the liver were found
to be severely enlarged. An examination of the cut surface of the enlarged area detected a
well circumscribed mass (40 &#xD7; 40 &#xD7; 20 cm), which consisted of dark red, fragile and
multilobular neoplastic tissue and an abundant bloody exudate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Cut surface of enlarged area of the liver. Neoplastic mass and centrally located
abscess within the neoplastic mass are observed. The mass is red to dark red-colored and
multi-lobulated with abundant blood exudate. The abscess contains caseous materials.
Bar, 10 cm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-729-g001"/></fig>). Moreover, an encapsulated abscess (15 &#xD7; 20 &#xD7; 10 cm) was located in the center of the
neoplastic tissue. The abscess contained a grayish-green to yellowish-white creamy caseous
substance. A single dilated and thickened bile duct was observed within the neoplastic tissue,
which was connected to the abscess and the hepatic duct. The hepatic duct and the intrahepatic
bile ducts within the hepatic lobes had also thickened and dilated and contained various
amounts of a dark green purulent caseous substance. The gallbladder exhibited pseudomembranous
inflammation. A bile sample obtained from the gallbladder was subjected to a culture test for
alimentary tract specimens at a human medical clinical laboratory (Kishimoto Clinical
Laboratory, Tomakomai, Japan), and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was isolated from the
sample. No choleliths were found in the biliary tract. There were no other significant
lesions, including traumatic lesions in the alimentary tract, such as injury by metal strips,
except for chronic peritonitis and jaundice.</p>
    <p>Tissue samples were collected, fixed in 15% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin
and cut into 5 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>m-thick sections. The paraffin-embedded sections were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin. Selected sections were stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)
reaction or Grimelius stain, or subjected to immunohistochemical examinations. The
immunohistochemical examinations were performed using the simple stain MAX-PO polymer reagent
(Nichirei Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan) after microwave antigen retrieval (20 min in 0.01 M
citrate buffer, pH 6.0). The following primary monoclonal antibodies were used: anti-vimentin
(Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), anti-desmin (Dako), anti-alpha smooth muscle actin (SMA) (Dako) and
anti-cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (Dako). Polyclonal antibodies against anti-factor VIII&#x2013;related
antigen (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) and anti-chromogranin (Nichirei Bioscience) were
also applied.</p>
    <p>Histologically, the mass was demarcated from the hepatic parenchyma by a thick region of
granulation tissue and consisted of proliferating neoplastic cells. The neoplastic cells were
small and round to cuboidal in shape and had clear cytoplasm and distinct borders. The cells
had distinct punched out nuclei, which were ovoid to polygonal in shape and exhibited mild
anisonucleosis, and obscure nucleoli. Mitotic figures were not frequently observed; i.e.,
approximately 3 mitotic figures were seen in 50 high power fields (&#xD7; 400). The neoplastic
cells were predominantly arranged in solid sheets, although proliferating foci were seen
around blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>A. Section from neoplastic tissue of the liver demonstrating the solid sheets of the

transitioned to cancellous structures containing blood-filled capillary-like non-neoplastic
blood vessels of varying sizes. Capillary endothelial cells were occasionally observed at
those blood vessels. Vascular invasion by the neoplastic cells was observed in the hepatic
parenchyma near the neoplastic mass, although there were no neoplastic foci in the other
organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Special staining demonstrated that
argyrophilic granules were absent. No PAS-reactive cytoplasmic substances were observed in the
neoplastic cells. On the other hand, PAS reaction demonstrated that a fine basement
membrane-like structure surrounded the neoplastic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells were positively stained for
vimentin and SMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2E</xref>) and negatively stained
for cytokeratin, factor VIII-related antigen, chromogranin and desmin.</p>
    <p>The abscess within the mass was completely surrounded by granulation tissue, was demarcated
and contained necrotic debris and bacterial clusters. Chronic suppurative cholangitis of the
intra-hepatic bile duct; i.e., hyperplastic peri-ductal connective tissue and inflammatory
cell infiltration (mainly involving neutrophils and lymphocytes) was widely observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2F</xref>). No inflammation was evident in the regions
surrounding the hepatic portal vein or the intrahepatic arteries. Regions of transmural
necrosis and fibrin attachment, which were admixed with numerous bacterial clusters containing
cocci and bacilli, were observed in the gallbladder. Bile emboli, ductular reactions, focal
parenchymal necrosis, bile extravasation and feathery hepatocyte degeneration were seen
throughout the liver. As for other organs, slight non-purulent interstitial nephritis was
observed in the kidneys.</p>
    <p>The present neoplastic cells were small round to cuboidal cells with clear cytoplasm. These
neoplastic cells were arranged in predominant solid sheet structures, proliferating foci
around blood vessels and cancellous structures containing blood-filled cavities. Based on the
predominant solid-sheet structure of the neoplastic cells and the presence of vascular
structures within the tumor, neuroendocrine tumors; tumors of vascular origin; and
vascular-associated tumors including glomus tumor, hemangiopericytoma and myopericytoma were
considered to be possible differential diagnoses. However, the neoplastic cells lacked
argyrophilic- or chromogranin-positive substances in their cytoplasm and did not express
factor VIII-related antigen, which ruled out tumors of neuroendocrine or vascular origin. The
pathological features of the present case; i.e., the detection of round or cuboidal cells with
distinct punched out nuclei and pale to clear eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in solid sheets
interrupted by vessels of varying sizes, corresponded to those of human glomus tumors [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In
addition, the presence of neoplastic cells around blood vessels resembled the distribution
pattern exhibited by glomus cells; whereas, there were no spindle-shaped neoplastic cells
arranged in perivascular whorling patterns, which is a characteristic of human myopericytoma
[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and
bovine hemangiopericytoma [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The immunohistochemical reactivity of the present tumor was consistent
with that of human glomus tumors, which are positive for vimentin and SMA [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Based on its histopathological and
immunohistological resemblance to human glomus tumors, the present neoplastic mass was
diagnosed as a primary glomus tumor of the liver. In addition to the subungual region (the
most common site), glomus tumors have been reported to occur at various sites in humans and
animals. However, glomus tumors of the liver have not been reported in animals. Only a few
reports have described human glomus tumors of the liver, and to the best of our knowledge,
this is the first report about a glomus tumor of the liver in an animal. The present glomus
tumor exhibited vascular invasion; however, metastatic foci were not observed despite the fact
that a large mass was observed in the liver during the macroscopic examination. In humans,
benign glomus tumors rarely display vascular invasion; however, such invasion is not
considered to be indicative of malignancy [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].
Although further accumulation of cases is necessary, it seems that in cows, glomus tumors with
vascular invasion also exhibit benign behavior.</p>
    <p>Glomus tumors are classified into solid, angiomatous and myxoid types based on their
morphological appearance [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Among the reported cases
of glomus tumor involving animals, most lesions belonged to the solid type; however, in the
only reported case of glomus tumor to involve a cow, the lesion belonged to the angiomatous
type [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Based on its predominant solid sheet
structure, the present lesion was classified as a solid type glomus tumor. Including the
present report, only two cases of glomus tumor involving cows have been described. Thus, more
cases of glomus tumor involving cows must be collected in order to confirm the sites at which
these tumors most commonly arise, their behavior and their histological classification. In
adult cows, the major causes of liver abscesses are reported to be bacterial infection via the
portal vein or a direct injury involving a foreign body [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The biliary tract is one of the major
routes of bacterial entry in cholangitis and cholangitic abscesses, especially in pigs [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. On the other hand, cholangitis is rare in cows [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and no cases
of cholangitic abscesses involving cows have been reported. Although it is possible that the
cholangitis observed in the present case was caused by a descending infection, the presence of
cholangitis in all hepatic lobes and the lack of inflammatory changes in the regions
surrounding the hepatic portal vein and the intrahepatic arteries suggested that the
cholangitis was caused by an ascending infection. The isolation of <italic>E. coli</italic>, a
major enterobacterium, also suggested that the cholangitis was caused by an ascending
infection. In humans, stenosis or obstruction of the biliary tract by a tumor can cause
hepatic abscesses [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, bile flow
congestion can cause ascending infections, inflammation and secondary abscess formation. In
the present case, cholangitis was widely distributed throughout the liver. The presence of a
connection between the abscess and the biliary tract indicated that the abscess originated
from a dilated and inflamed bile duct. Macroscopically, the abscess was limited to the tumor
tissue in spite of the presence of diffuse cholangitis. It is suspected that tumors had some
relationship with the abscess formation, but detailed mechanisms remain unclear.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, the present report described a primary glomus tumor of the liver and a
suspected tumor-related cholangitic abscess in a cow. Our findings suggest that glomus tumors
can arise in the liver in cows.</p>
