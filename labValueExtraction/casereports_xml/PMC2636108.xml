      <abstract>
        <p>We report a 25-year-old systemically healthy male who presented
with periocular necrotizing fasciitis (NF) in the left eyelid. This
was associated with the presence of immunologically mediated
marginal kerato-conjunctivitis, in the same eye. This potentially
dangerous lid infection and the associated ocular surface infection
resolved successfully, with medical management. We report this
case to highlight the successful conservative management of
periocular NF and the hitherto unreported anterior segment
involvement.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is the anatomical description
used to describe the extensive necrosis of the subcutaneous
tissues that is most commonly caused by a rapidly spreading
infection of <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> in the subcutaneous plane.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
Necrotizing fasciitis is a serious life-threatening condition,
with reported mortality of more than 20%. The limbs,
perineum and abdomen are frequently involved with facial
involvement being rare. The organisms most closely linked
to NF are <italic>Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci</italic> (NF Type II),
though these bacteria are isolated in only a minority of the
cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> The rarer NF Type I is caused due to polymicrobial
infections and the usual pathogens are obligate and facultative
anerobes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></p>
    <p>Periocular NF is reported to have a better prognosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
Though reports of resolution of periocular NF post surgical
debridement are common, a detailed Medline and Embase
search revealed only one case series reporting resolution
with conservative management.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> In addition, to the best of
our knowledge, there are no published reports of anterior
segment ocular involvement in periocular NF. We report this
case to highlight the successful conservative management
of periocular NF and the hitherto unreported ocular
involvement.</p>

      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>A 25-year-old systemically healthy male patient presented
with complaints of severe photophobia, redness, discharge,
pain and severe swelling of the lids in the left eye, since two
days.</p>
      <p>Past history was significant for a boil on the lower
eyelid, two days ago. On examination, the best-corrected
visual acuity was 20/20 and 20/30, in the right and left eyes
respectively. Right eye examination was unremarkable. The
left eye showed severe lid edema with scales on the skin and
associated kerato-conjunctivitis [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1A">Fig. 1A</xref>]. The cornea showed
multiple marginal infiltrates. Photographic documentation
of the anterior segment condition was impossible because of
the severe photophobia. Extraocular movements were full.
A conjunctival swab and a periorbital skin swab were sent
for culture and sensitivity. The corneal infiltrates were also
cultured on blood agar and Sabouraud&#x2032;s dextrose agar. The
patient was seen by our infectious diseases expert and started
on intravenous co-amoxiclav (Augmentin, GlaxoSmithKline)
1 g twice daily, intravenous ceftriaxone (ceftriaxone sodium,
Sandoz, Novartis) 1 g twice daily and oral metronidazole
(Flagyl, Searle) 500 mg three times daily, pending sensitivity
reports. Topical loteprednol etabonate (0.5%) (Alrex eye drops,
Bausch and Lomb Incorporated) every three hourly and
ciprofloxacin (0.3%) (Ciplox eye drops, Cipla) six times a day
were started, in the left eye.</p>
      <p>On follow-up two days later, the patient was symptomatically
much better. The skin scabs had fallen off, revealing violaceous,
sub-epidermal necrosis. The conjunctival inflammation had
reduced and the corneal marginal infiltrates had almost
disappeared [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1B">Fig. 1B</xref>]. Culture and sensitivity results showed
<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, sensitive to the administered medications.
The culture plates for corneal infiltrates showed negative
growth and were discarded after three weeks. The patient was
sero-negative for HIV.</p>
      <p>Five days later, the skin lesions had healed and the
conjunctivitis had resolved. Intravenous antibiotics were
stopped and the patient was started on oral co-amoxiclav
(Augmentin, GlaxoSmithKline), 625 mg thrice a day, for a
week.</p>
      <p>On final follow-up a month later, periocular skin discoloration
was the only sequalae noted [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>].</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="">
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Infections in the periocular region occur post surgical
procedures, post trauma, furunculosis or even without any
antecedent cause.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></p>
      <p>Ideally, a combination of intensive parenteral antimicrobial
therapy and prompt surgical debridement of necrotic tissue
should be done. Intravenous pooled immunoglobulin and
heparinization may also have beneficial roles by neutralizing
super-antigen activity and aiding antibiotic perfusion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></p>
      <p>Necrotizing fasciitis is a clinical diagnosis. Necrotizing
fasciitis limited to the eyelids looks and behaves differently
from NF affecting other parts of the body, due to the excellent
blood supply in the eyelid area.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> Mild cases, especially those
restricted to the eyelids alone may respond to medical therapy.
The increased blood supply allows for delayed debridement,
because the local vasculature allows for better access of
the systemic antibiotics to the infected area. The marginal
zone of tissue surrounding the infected area has better
local blood supply and hence a higher chance of avoiding
necrosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></p>
      <p>We report the case of a 25-year-old male patient who presented
with periocular NF associated with kerato-conjunctivitis.
Associated kerato-conjunctivitis is commonly reported following
lid infection of staphylococcal etiology. The paucity of literature
regarding this entity, in association with <italic>staphylococcus</italic>-induced
periocular NF probably stems from an under-reporting bias.
These infiltrates are usually the result of an immunological
reaction with staphylococcal antigens but in cases with severe
infection as in our patient, the infiltrates need to be cultured for
an infectious etiology. The patient responded to conservative
medical management with systemic antibiotics, topical antibiotics
and topical steroids. We report this case to highlight the successful
conservative management of periocular NF and the hitherto
unreported anterior segment involvement.</p>
