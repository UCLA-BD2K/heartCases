      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Obesity is a major public health problem worldwide; a quarter of the world's population
is in the range of overweight and 10% are considered obese. In Brazil, half the
population is overweight (BMI&gt;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and 17.5% is obese (BMI&gt;30
kg/m<sup>2</sup>)<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Bariatric
surgery is the most effective method of treatment of severe or morbid obesity (BMI&gt;40
kg/m<sup>2</sup> or BMI&gt;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with comorbidities), presenting
superior results with respect to weight loss, control of comorbidities, improved quality
of life and survival compared to medical treatment<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Hepatobiliary complex interventions in severely obese patients
are associated with increased risk of bleeding, postoperative complications and
mortality, due to the technical difficulty (exposure) and higher incidence of clinical
comorbidities<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Morbid obesity
is a relative contraindication to liver transplantation for the same reasons.
Furthermore, long-term survival of transplanted obese patients is also reduced.
Nevertheless, in the United States, 7% of patients undergoing liver transplantation are
obese<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Some centers determine
BMI less than 35 as a precondition for liver transplantation<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Furthermore, up to one third of patients undergoing
liver transplantation become obese within three years postoperatively. The factors
associated to this phenomenon are: sedentary lifestyle, improvement of appetite, change
in eating habits (abandonment of the pre-transplant rigid diet), history of obesity and
use of immunosuppressant, particularly corticosteroids<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Part of these individuals may become morbidly obese, and
in some cases the development of steatosis in the transplanted liver, may even
compromise the function of the graft. In this situation there is also an increase in the
incidence of other comorbidities, such as type II diabetes. Patient education and
dietary treatment are the key measures of prevention and treatment of obesity after
liver transplantation<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. In some
situations, bariatric surgery may be indicated in order to delay or inhibit this
evolution. There are few studies on the surgical treatment of morbid obesity after liver
transplantation, all made in small series<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Here is reported the case of one patient who underwent a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy
15 months after orthotopic liver transplantation, who developed stenosis of the biliary
anastomosis and weight gain postoperatively.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>Female of 33 years old with a history of obesity since childhood, was submitted in
December 2012 to a liver transplant by piggyback technique, cadaver donor for autoimmune
hepatitis and hepatitis C. The MELD score was 31; the patient had ascites and was
admitted for treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and clinical compensation
for two weeks prior to the transplant. In the day before the transplantation, she has
shown little swelling, her weight was 106 kg, height 1.69 m and BMI 37.1
kg/m<sup>2</sup>. She received 10U of cryoprecipitate, 10 platelet apheresis and 650
ml of autotransfusion through the cell saver. The early postoperative outcome was
without any clinical or surgical complications. In the late postoperative period (after
three months) she started to gain weight, reaching 134 kg after 10 months (BMI=47
kg/m<sup>2</sup>), associated with onset of hypertension and type II diabetes. She
has received dietary counseling, managing to reach 112 kg (BMI=39 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and
stabilizing at that level, with partial improvement of diabetes and hypertension (still
in need of medication for the treatment of both). Concomitantly, the patient developed
stenosis of the biliary anastomosis, initially treated by percutaneous external drainage
and later by combined internal and external drainage (rendezvous). For the definitive
treatment of the biliary stenosis, a coledochal-jejunal anastomosis was proposed. Due to
the degree of obesity presented by the patient, presence of comorbidities and risk of
reoperation on the biliary tract in obese patients, bariatric surgery was proposed, so
that the patient could have good weight loss, better control of comorbidities and better
surgical conditions for the revisional procedure on the bile duct. After 15 months of
transplantation, the patient underwent a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The operation
began by lysis of adhesions and the separation of the left lobe of the liver, firmly
attached to the anterior wall of the stomach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure
1</xref>). Stapling was started at 4.0 cm from the pylorus, and a 32 Fr "bougie" was
used for calibration. Was used green cartridge for the first staple line
(Ethicon&#xAE;), gold for the second and blue in three subsequent shots (five in
total, all 60 mm). Oversuture of the staple line was held with Vicryl&#xAE; 2.0 line,
a distance of about 5 cm from the esophagogastric angle, and thereafter continuous
transfixing suture of the staple line (hemostatic) until the end of it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>). Was performed fixation of the omentum
along the staple line with the objective of reducing adhesions and help prevent rotation
of the stomach and drained the cavity with silicone tube. The surgical time was 120
minutes, anesthetic time of 150 minutes. There was no need for transfusions and the
patient had a good postoperative course. The abdominal drain was removed on the
7<sup>th</sup> day after radiological evidence of the absence of fistula. There was
good food adaptation and resumption of oral immunosuppressive medication from the
2<sup>nd</sup> postoperative day. The patient has lost 30 kg during the first 150
days post-operatively, which represented 75% of excess weight. There was good control of
diabetes and hypertension, with discontinuation of medication for both. There was no
change in liver function throughout evolution, so far. The definitive treatment of the
biliary stenosis through biliary-digestive anastomosis is now being programmed.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>In recent years, improvements in perioperative care has enabled an increase in survival
of transplant patients, which reaches levels of 85 to 90% at one year and 70-80% after
five years in high volume centers<sup>11</sup>. Nevertheless, the impact of obesity on
long-term results of liver transplantation has become increasingly evident, associated
with recurrence of NASH and increased incidence of diabetes, dyslipidemia and
cardiovascular disease, jeopardizing the survival of these patients<sup>12</sup>. In
this sense, although it is a big risk, treating obesity in these patients is warranted,
including surgical procedures. For this reason, Heinbach et al.<sup>13</sup> performed
orthotopic liver transplants associated with sleeve gastrectomy in seven patients with
BMI&gt;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. There was one fistula, with good evolution, and no mortality
or graft loss in any case. No patient developed steatosis or type II diabetes in the
late follow-up. In the other hand, in a group of 34 patients with similar
characteristics, submitted to isolated transplantation, steatosis was observed in 12/34,
and type II diabetes has been diagnosed in 21/34 patients<sup>13</sup>. Others have used
the same technique in obese patients in a liver transplantation program, but prior to
the transplant, with low morbidity and no mortality<sup>14,15</sup>. In the presented
case, the patient was obese since childhood and unresponsive to dietary treatment. She
was transplanted with a high BMI, but in a situation that would certainly not enable
prior treatment for weight loss, given the complications (ascites, SBP) and high
MELD.</p>
      <p>Sariatric surgery after liver transplantation was first described by Garc&#xED;a
Duchini and Brunson in 2001<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, who
performed conventional gastric bypass in two patients, with good results (weight loss,
normalization of blood glucose levels, regression of steatosis). The first case of
laparoscopic gastric bypass was described by Tichanski and Madan in 2005, also with a
good outcome<sup>15</sup>. However, a retrospective study conducted at the University of
Minnesota, which evaluated seven patients who underwent conventional bypass after liver
transplantation between 2001 and 2009<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, revealed that two patients died six and nine months after bariatric
surgery of multiple organ failure and metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,
respectively. Another patient had the operation reversed for severe malnutrition and
four patients had good results (57%).</p>
      <p>More recently, Lin et al.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> performed
sleeve gastrectomy in nine patients with a past of liver transplantation, eight by
videolaparoscopy and one by laparotomy. The mean operative time was 165 min and the mean
hospital stay was five days. One patient operated by videolaparoscopy developed a
biliary fistula from the liver surface and required reoperation for drainage; and
another had postoperative dysphagia which was also treated surgically. There was no
mortality. Eli et al.<sup>16</sup> performed the same procedure by robotics, with good
results. In this case, the most laborious surgical time was certainly detachment of the
left lobe of the liver adhered to the anterior wall of the stomach. Was carry out
drainage routinely in patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy because is believed that it
can contribute to the early diagnosis of a fistula, avoid reoperation and it do not add
morbidity to the procedure. The small number of studies and cases operated in the
described situation, do not allow a conclusion or consensus as to the optimal bariatric
technique after liver transplant. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is associated with
malabsorption of micronutrients (iron, calcium, zinc, copper) and vitamins (B12 and D)
and can affect the absorption of immunosuppressive drugs, which could theoretically
compromise the evolution of the patients<sup>17</sup>. The adjustable gastric band,
which has also been used<sup>18</sup> is the insertion of a foreign body that can cause
an increased risk of infection in immunocompromised patients. Sleeve gastrectomy has
occupied the space of the adjustable gastric band, promotes greater weight loss, do not
demand the maintenance required by the band and also does not compromise the absorption
of either nutrients or medications<sup>19</sup>. For this reason, it has been the
preferred technique by most authors for the treatment of morbid obesity in patients with
liver disease before or after liver transplantation. However, more studies are needed to
assess the progress and long-term complications in transplant patients undergoing
bariatric surgery, as well as the best technique for treating this group of
patients.</p>
