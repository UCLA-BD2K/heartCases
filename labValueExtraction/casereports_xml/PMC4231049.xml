      <abstract>
        <p>The aim of this study was to identify the genetic basis of a chorioretinal dystrophy with high myopia of unknown origin in a child of a consanguineous marriage. The proband and ten family members of Iranian ancestry participated in this study. Linkage analysis was carried out with DNA samples of the proband and her parents by using the Human SNP Array 6.0. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed with the patients&#x2019; DNA. Specific sequence alterations within the homozygous regions identified by whole exome sequencing were verified by Sanger sequencing. Upon genetic analysis, a novel homozygous frameshift mutation was found in exon 42 of the <italic>COL18A1</italic> gene in the patient. Both parents were heterozygous for this sequence variation. Mutations in <italic>COL18A1</italic> are known to cause Knobloch syndrome (KS). Retrospective analysis of clinical records of the patient revealed surgical removal of a meningocele present at birth. The clinical features shown by our patient were typical of KS with the exception of chorioretinal degeneration which is a rare manifestation. This is the first case of KS reported in a family of Iranian ancestry. We identified a novel disease-causing (deletion) mutation in the <italic>COL18A1</italic> gene leading to a frameshift and premature stop codon in the last exon. The mutation was not present in SNP databases and was also not found in 192 control individuals. Its localization within the endostatin domain implicates a functional relevance of endostatin in KS. A combined approach of linkage analysis and WES led to a rapid identification of the disease-causing mutation even though the clinical description was not completely clear at the beginning.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Knobloch syndrome (MIM:267750) (KS) is a very rare autosomal recessive developmental disorder. It is characterized by vitreoretinal degeneration usually with recurrent retinal detachment, retinitis pigmentosa-like features, lens subluxation, congenital high myopia, macular abnormalities and occipital encephalocele. The ocular features of the disease are similar to Stickler syndrome with optically empty vitreous and severe chorioretinal degeneration and high myopia, which is caused by mutations in collagen genes <xref rid="pone.0112747-Seaver1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112747-Sertie1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Since its first introduction in 1971 by Knobloch and Layer, more than 50 cases have been reported all over the world. A defect in early cephalic neuroectodermal morphogenesis has also been suggested <xref rid="pone.0112747-Seaver1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. From 1971 to 1994, three families were reported from Hungary and the US, as well as a large Brazilian family with a history of consanguinity <xref rid="pone.0112747-Seaver1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112747-Czeizel1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112747-PassosBueno1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, all supporting the autosomal recessive inheritance of this condition. In 1996, homozygosity mapping in the same Brazilian family with 11 affected individuals assigned the KS gene to 21q22.3, close to the marker D21S17 <xref rid="pone.0112747-Sertie1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Through a positional cloning approach, Sertie et al. showed that mutations in <italic>COL18A1</italic> are responsible for KS <xref rid="pone.0112747-Sertie2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The gene is transcribed by use of two promoters and alternative splicing of the third exon <xref rid="pone.0112747-Saarela1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The C-terminal part (183 amino acids), designated endostatin, can be cleaved-off proteolytically <xref rid="pone.0112747-Oreilly1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Collagen XVIII, encoded by the <italic>COL18A1</italic> gene, has an important role in determining the retinal structure as well as closure of the neural tube <xref rid="pone.0112747-Sertie2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This protein is an essential component of the basement membrane of the iris, vitreous and retina and its presence is critical for normal eye development during embryogenesis. Collagen XVIII also seems to play important functional roles in neuronal cell migration and as a component of the basement membrane of kidney as well as teeth development <xref rid="pone.0112747-OConnell1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112747-PassosBueno2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. It has been shown in an experimental model that collagen XVIII is also important for maintaining capillary permeability in striated muscle <xref rid="pone.0112747-Rygh1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Williams et al. reported a case of KS with bilateral renal anomalies, which implies a role of collagen XVIII in kidney physiology <xref rid="pone.0112747-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In 1998, Wilson et al. reported two siblings from New Zealand and proposed a possible involvement of mesoderm in morphogenesis as those patients had abnormal pulmonary lymphatics <xref rid="pone.0112747-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Sniderman et al. reported a case with anterior midline scalp defect reflecting further clinical variability in this rare autosomal recessive syndrome <xref rid="pone.0112747-Sniderman1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mutations in <italic>COL18A1</italic> gene can lead to occipital encephalocele and severe ocular alterations <xref rid="pone.0112747-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It was also shown that a lack of either the short (NC1-303) or long isoform (NC1-728) of collagen XVIII causes similar phenotypes, but patients lacking all isoforms exhibit increasingly severe ocular alterations. This suggests that both isoforms play critical roles in the maintenance and organization of the human eye <xref rid="pone.0112747-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In 2003, Kliemann et al. reported neuronal migration disorders in two Brazilian patients for the first time <xref rid="pone.0112747-Kliemann1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This was followed by the report of a case with persistent fetal vasculature and initiated the discussion of a possible role of endostatin in vascular remodeling of the fetal eye <xref rid="pone.0112747-Duh1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In two siblings with KS from France, one presented with mental retardation and severe supratentorial CNS anomalies, and a second fetus with severe brain malformations, complete vermian agenesis, and mesencephalic hamartoma, suggested that either endostatin or full-length collagen XVIII play a role in neuronal migration, revealing that CNS anomalies in KS were more severe than initially thought <xref rid="pone.0112747-Keren1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In addition, Knobloch syndrome was found to be associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in an El Salvadorian patient. The authors proposed that an increased risk of cancer may be an endostatin associated effect and suggested monitoring of KS cases with respect to leukemia or other cancers <xref rid="pone.0112747-Mahajan1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we report an Iranian family in which the proband was initially diagnosed with congenital chorioretinal degeneration and myopia. A combination of homozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing (WES) identified a novel mutation in <italic>COL18A1</italic> and led to the diagnosis of Knobloch syndrome. This is the first case of KS identified using such an approach. It is also the first KS case found in a family of Iranian descent.</p>

        <p>The female proband (IV-1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112747-g001">Figure 1a</xref>) was examined at 10 years of age. She initially presented at eight months of age with deviation and involuntary eye movements. On physical examination, at the first visit, she had nystagmus and esotropia, and normal anterior segment oculus uterque (both eyes, OU) [specifically speaking iris was normal OU and after pupillary dilation there was no abnormality in lens periphery OU]. Cycloplegic refraction revealed highly myopic refractive error OU (&#x2212;16.00 D). Dilated fundus examination showed waxy optic discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112747-g001">Figure 1c</xref>-white arrow) with a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.1, arterial narrowing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112747-g001">Figure 1b</xref>-white arrow) and a diffuse chorioretinal atrophy with a well-defined central atrophic lesion in the center of the macula OU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112747-g001">Figure 1c</xref>-arrowhead).</p>

        <p>Her parents were first cousins and there was no history of any similar condition in the family, apart from the high myopia in two of the aunts (III-10: &#x2212;8.00 D, OU with myopic chorioretinal atrophy and III-11: &#x2212;16.00 D: OD; &#x2212;9.50&#x2013;2.00&#xD7;85&#xB0;:OS with high myopic chorioretinal atrophy) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112747-g001">Figure 1a</xref>).</p>

          <list-item>
            <p>Congenital-onset central chorioretinal dystrophy associated with high myopia <xref rid="pone.0112747-Iqbal1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, this has been reported in a family in middle east without genotyping; however ocular features are very similar to our patient</p>

          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Eye glasses were prescribed for the patient and she was then followed up somewhere else for seven years. At 8 years of age, her physical and intellectual developments were normal. At school, she maintained good academic standing, with the assistance of low-vision aids such as magnifiers or magnified prints. On ophthalmic examination, nystagmus was apparent. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/400 OU and the refractive error was &#x2212;12.50 D, OU. Dilated fundus examination was remarkable for waxy optic nerve with a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.1, arterial narrowing and diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (myopic changes) with a well-defined central atrophic lesion with prominent underlying large choroidal vessels. The clinical findings were the same as seven years ago.</p>
        <p>A few months later, she presented with a chief complaint of visual field defect in the left eye for a few days. Fundus examination revealed a superonasal retinal detachment. She underwent 23-gauge pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and silicone oil injection. After 2 months, she developed cataract (as a consequence of vitrectomy surgery); however, the retina was flat. Cataract surgery and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation (PC IOL) were performed accompanied with removal of silicone oil through a separate scleral incision. BCVA after the surgery was 20/400. Two years later, she developed posterior capsule opacity, which required YAG laser capsulotomy to restore the vision.</p>
        <p>Ophthalmic examination of the parents was unremarkable with normal vision and extraocular movements, and normal anterior and posterior segments. The proband&#x2019;s two aunts (III-10 and III-11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112747-g001">Figure 1a</xref>) had high myopia OU. Anterior segments were normal OU.

          <p>In total, 8.87 Gb of data were obtained upon sequencing that constituted about 9.5*10<sup>7</sup> reads. While mean coverage was 98x, 97% of sequences had at least 10-times coverage and 90% of the sequences were covered at least 30-times. 38276 variants were obtained from the whole-exome sequencing of the patient&#x2019;s DNA and alignment to the reference sequence. Using the &#x201C;regions of interest&#x201D; file (see Materials and Methods), variants were annotated by using Alamut-HT. 2327 variants were obtained in the homozygosity regions of interest with 219 of them being novel (not annotated in dbSNP).

          <p>The family of the proband spanned four generations and comprises 19 family members. The parents of the index patient were first cousins. The proband and ten other family members were involved in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112747-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). Subjects were genotyped by direct Sanger sequencing of the mutation in <italic>COL18A1</italic> (NM_130445.2:c.3825_3838del:p.Ser1276Alafs*9). Sanger sequencing confirmed the exome sequencing results that the proband (IV-1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112747-g001">Figure 1a</xref>) was homozygous for this mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112747-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112747-g003">3a</xref>). Parents of the proband (III-7 and III-8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112747-g001">Figure 1a</xref>) were heterozygous for the same mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112747-g003">Figure 3a</xref>), so were two uncles (III-3 and III-4) and two aunts (III-5 and III-11) (data not shown). Three uncles (III-6, III-9 and III-12, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112747-g001">Figure 1a</xref>) and one aunt (III-10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112747-g001">Figure 1a</xref>) did not carry this mutation (data not shown). This frameshift deletion cosegregated with the phenotype in the family as an autosomal recessive trait as expected for Knobloch syndrome. The mutation was absent in control DNA samples of Caucasian origin from 192 unrelated individuals tested for this mutation (data not shown). Controls from Iranian descent were not available. Two of the aunts (III-10 and III-11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112747-g001">Figure 1a</xref>) also showed high myopia but this condition did not cosegregate with the identified <italic>COL18A1</italic> frameshift deletion. III-10 was homozygous for the reference allele and III-11 was heterozygous for the mutation but both had high-grade myopia.</p>

      <p>The proband is the first case of Knobloch syndrome in a family of Iranian descent. Twenty mutations leading to KS have been described in the <italic>COL18A1</italic> gene.

      <p>Since the patient was an offspring of a first cousin marriage, we employed a combined approach of homozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing and identified the disease-causing mutation using only a fraction of the time and costs in comparison to that required by conventional analysis. By filtering the exome data with our filtering pipeline (described in Materials and Methods), only a single sequence variant in the <italic>COL18A1</italic> gene remained as a mutation candidate associated with the disease.</p>
      <p>The patient was initially clinically characterized with congenital-onset central chorioretinal dystrophy and myopia. Since we found a mutation in <italic>COL18A1,</italic> a gene that had been previously associated with Knobloch syndrome, we reanalyzed the clinical data in depth. Retrospective evaluation of additional clinical data upon identification of the mutation in <italic>COL18A1</italic> revealed that the patient had a meningocele surgically removed at 6 weeks of age. Thus the clinical picture of the patient is consistent with Knobloch syndrome. Mutations in <italic>COL18A1</italic> are specific to Knobloch Syndrome and no additional gene has been identified so far <xref rid="pone.0112747-Aldahmesh2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The phenotype includes retinal detachment, nystagmus and congenital meningocele. While vitreoretinal degeneration is the more common phenotype seen in KS patients, our patient showed chorioretinal degeneration, a rather uncommon phenotype, which has been previously reported by Mahajan et al. 2010 <xref rid="pone.0112747-Mahajan1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Two of the family members of the patient had extreme myopia, which is a phenotype frequently observed in KS patients. However, this did not segregate with the <italic>COL18A1</italic> mutation in the family.</p>
      <p>The spectrum of ophthalmologic findings in KS was documented in a recent report by Khan et al <xref rid="pone.0112747-Khan1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> in eight patients. Six of their patients had ectopia lentis, which was not seen in our case; however their retinal findings are very similar to our case. We suggest that in patients with congenital high myopia, retinitis pigmentosa like chorioretinal atrophy and a well-defined atrophic macular lesion, Knobloch syndrome should be considered as the most likely diagnosis. It seems that anterior segment findings are less consistent. These cases are at a high risk of retinal detachment at young age and should be carefully observed.</p>
      <p>Collagen XVIII is encoded by three isoforms, each differing in their N-terminal regions. The mutation described in this study, c.3825_3838del, causes a frameshift deletion in the last exon of <italic>COL18A1</italic>, thus leading to an incomplete mRNA. This region of <italic>COL18A1</italic> also encodes for a cleavable protein called endostatin that has been shown to be anti-angiogenic and inhibit tumor formation <xref rid="pone.0112747-Oreilly1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The identified mutation causes loss of the terminal 60 amino acids of endostatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112747-g003">Figure 3c</xref>, truncated amino acids are highlighted in yellow). This immediately points to a role of endostatin in the disease physiology of KS. Endostatin is encoded by all isoforms of <italic>COL18A1</italic>, therefore, a mutation in the domain containing endostatin will affect all isoforms of <italic>COL18A1</italic>. Previous studies have shown a severe loss of endostatin levels in KS patients <xref rid="pone.0112747-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112747-Suzuki2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Due to poor health condition of the proband, we could not obtain additional samples for verifying her endostatin levels.</p>
      <p>Fukai et al. showed that mice lacking collagen XVIII/endostatin manifest developmental eye defects, e.g. lack or abnormal outgrowth of retina, delayed regression of blood vessels in the vitreous along the surface of retina after birth and reduced expression of VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) <xref rid="pone.0112747-Fukai1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Persistent fetal vasculature is the other endostatin-deficiency related condition in KS patients. Loss of endostatin or its deficiency might cause delayed or reduced fetal blood vessel regression in the eye. This can cause failure of normal vascular development in the retina <xref rid="pone.0112747-Duh1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Endostatin physically interacts with extracellular matrix components such as laminin-1, fibulin-1, fibulin-2, fibronectin, heparin sulfate, nidogen-2 and perlecan <xref rid="pone.0112747-Duh1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112747-Suzuki2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112747-Sasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112747-Sasaki2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Mutations in collagen XVIII/endostatin that lead to loss of the protein/protein function might thus cause changes in the overall structural organization and stability of the extracellular matrix. Therefore, phenotypic variations of mutations in collagen XVIII could be either due to reorganization of the ECM (structural changes) or through defects in angiogenesis during eye development.</p>
      <p>This study describes a novel KS-causing mutation in <italic>COL18A1</italic>. Our results also suggest a role of endostatin in the physiopathology of KS. In the genetic analysis of this case, even though the LOD scores obtained upon linkage analysis were not significant (Significance &#x2265;3, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112747.s001">figure S1</xref>), using the relatively small homozygous regions, we were able to detect the disease-causing mutation upon whole exome analysis. Identification of the mutation using this combined approach can facilitate the confirmation of the clinical diagnosis when the initial clinical picture is not fully clear. In our case, the initial clinical diagnosis was congenital-onset central chorioretinal dystrophy and myopia. Identification of a mutation in <italic>COL18A1</italic> led to a retrospective clinical analysis upon which the clinical diagnosis was confirmed to be Knobloch syndrome. With different medical systems across the world and increased mobility of human beings to different countries and geographical areas, a complete clinical record is not always available to clinicians. Molecular analysis tools such as that described is this study can provide the necessary support for a precise clinical characterization and diagnosis of the disease. This may contribute to application of correct treatment and or medical care regimen. In addition, this approach led to identification of the underlying causative mutation using a fraction of the costs and time in comparison to the conventional candidate gene approaches. Thus, it presents a strong case for using a combined approach of linkage analysis (homozygosity mapping) with exome sequencing for rapid and cost-effective diagnosis of Mendelian diseases.</p>
