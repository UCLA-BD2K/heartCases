        <p>Eosinophilic enteritis (EOE) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease and is characterized
clinically by chronic obstinate diarrhea. Three Japanese Black (JB) fattening cattle (2
males and 1 female) on different cattle farms presented with chronic episodic diarrhea
without fever or dehydration. Soft reddish spherical carneous tissues (1&#x2212;3 cm) were
occasionally excreted within the diarrheic feces. Administration of antibiotics,
antidiarrheal drugs and vermicides had no therapeutic effect, but dexamethasone improved
the fecal characteristics. The symptoms persisted until the animals were slaughtered at
27&#x2013;30 months of age. Histopathological examination of the intestines revealed marked
eosinophilic infiltration in the lamina propria and submucosa. From these findings, we
diagnosed these cattle as the first cases of EOE in JB cattle.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to a group of idiopathic, chronic gastrointestinal
tract disorders characterized by infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract by inflammatory
cells that are generally confined to the mucosa, such as lymphocytes, plasma cells,
neutrophils and eosinophils [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. IBD is a common disease
characterized by persistent or recurrent gastrointestinal signs, such as diarrhea and weight
loss, in certain animal species and humans [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Eosinophilic enteritis (EOE) is part of the IBD complex
and is a morphological diagnosis characterized by inflammation in which eosinophilic
leucocytes predominate [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], with clinical signs typified
by chronic obstinate diarrhea. It is a minor cause of IBD in humans [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], dogs [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], cats [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and horses [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; however, few
cases of EOE in cattle have been reported [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This
research group previously reported 4 cases of idiopathic EOE in cattle, aged 1 (Angus heifer),
5 (Simmental bull), 7 (Holstein cow) and 11 (Holstein cow) years old, diagnosed on the basis
of clinical and histopathological findings and exclusion of other differential diagnoses for
cattle with chronic diarrhea and weight loss. However, to the best of our knowledge, neither
the occurrence of EOE in Japanese Black (JB) cattle nor the associated clinical symptoms from
the first appearance of their symptoms after purchase or birth to completion of their
fattening periods (approximately 30 months of age) have been reported thus
far.</p>
    <p>Herein, we describe 3 JB fattening cattle that showed chronic diarrhea with excretion of
&#x201C;spherical tissue&#x201D; in their feces and improved fecal characteristics for several days with
only dexamethasone administration. Thus, we made a preliminary diagnosis of EOE on the basis
of a combination of clinical findings and exclusion of other diseases by biochemical analysis
before slaughter at completion of the normal fattening period and confirmed the diagnosis by
histopathological examination of intestinal tissues. Predictive diagnostic criteria of bovine
EOE are proposed from the clinical and histopathological findings.</p>
    <p><italic>Our clinical records from 2010 to 2013 include 3 such cases</italic>: 3 JB animals (2
steers and 1 heifer) reared for fattening purposes on different cattle farms. The detailed

episodic diarrhea without fever or dehydration starting at an early stage after purchase
(Cases 1 and 2) or birth (Case 3), with occasional excretion within the diarrheic feces of a
small number of soft reddish spherical carneous tissues (1&#x2212;3 cm in diameter) of unknown origin
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Soft reddish spherical carneous tissues (1&#x2212;3 cm in diameter) in the diarrheic feces of
the 3 cattle cases (a, Case 1; b, Case 2; c, Case 3).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-337-g001"/></fig>). In all cases, although therapeutic interventions consisting mainly of antibiotics,
antidiarrheal drugs and vermicides administered when the diarrhea was observed had no
therapeutic effect, the administration of dexamethasone (3&#x2212;5&#xA0;mg/head mixed with ampicillin and
administered by intramuscular injection daily for 3 days) temporarily improved the fecal
characteristics for a period of several days. The chronic diarrhea and excretion of the
&#x201C;spherical tissue&#x201D; persisted until the cattle were slaughtered at 27&#x2013;30 months of age;
however, all 3 animals had normal appetites, growth rates and body weights when compared to
other cattle without diarrhea that were housed on the same farm.</p>
    <p>For exclusion of differential disease diagnoses, antemortem fecal examinations of these 3
animals were performed to determine the presence of pathogenic bacteria (<italic>Escherichia
coli,</italic> culture on DHL agar and detection of 99K antigen with TETRASTRIPS [Bio-X
Diagnostics, Sprl]; <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp., culture on DHL agar; <italic>Clostridium
perfringens</italic>, culture on DHL agar; and <italic>C. difficile</italic> [C. Diff Quick
Check Complete; Techlab<sup>&#xAE;</sup>]), viruses (coronavirus [Tetrastrips; Bio-X Diagnostics,
Sprl]) and rotavirus [Tetrastrips]), protozoa (<italic>Eimeria</italic> spp. and
<italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp.) and parasites. A complete blood count and serum
biochemical profile were performed in 2 of the animals (Cases 2 and 3). Additionally, PCR and
ELISA (Johne&#x2019;s screening ELISA kit; Institute of Microbial Chemistry) assays were performed to
exclude bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) and Johne&#x2019;s disease, respectively. Overall, pathogenic
microorganisms that may cause long-term chronic diarrhea were not detected in the feces of the
3 animals. Additionally, the test results for BVD and Johne&#x2019;s disease were negative.</p>
    <p>For final diagnosis of the affected animals, tissue samples of the intestinal tracts were
collected immediately after slaughter at completion (27 and 30 months of age) of the fattening
period and were evaluated histopathologically, along with the excreted spherical tissues,
which were collected at first appearance of the symptoms and fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin. The fixed intestinal and spherical tissues were embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned
at 4-<italic>&#xB5;</italic>m thickness, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined
histopathologically. Macroscopic observation of the intestinal tract revealed areas of severe
hemorrhage, particularly in the colonic mucosa, in all 3 cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Gross appearance of the colon of the 3 cattle cases.

particularly in the colonic mucosa, observed in all 3 cases (a, Case 1; b, Case 2; c,
Case 3).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-337-g002"/></fig>). However, macroscopic observation revealed no pathological abnormalities in other
organs in any of the 3 cases. Histological examination revealed marked eosinophilic,
lymphocytic and plasmacytic inflammatory-cell infiltration in the lamina propria of the
jejunum, cecum, colon and rectum, which partially extended to the submucosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Microscopic appearance of the colon of the animal in Case 1 as a representative case

they consisted mainly of a fibrin clot, including mucosal epithelial cells, red blood cells
and eosinophils, which were speculated to have derived from the persistently inflamed tissues
in the intestinal tract of the affected cattle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig.

affected cattle (b; &#xD7; 400). Epithelial cells are indicated with arrows and eosinophils
with arrowheads.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-337-g004"/></fig>).</p>
    <p>The white blood cell (WBC) counts were 8,800 and 10,500 cells/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>, and the
percentages of eosinophils were 3% and 1%, respectively, which indicated no elevation of
eosinophils in the peripheral blood. Parameters reflecting hydration status were all within
the normal range. Additionally, although the levels of certain serum biochemical parameters
were outside the reference range (e.g., in Case 3, the high GGT concentration [37.0
U/<italic>l</italic>] was considered to reflect cholangitis diagnosed when the animal was
slaughtered), no abnormalities in the biochemical profile of the parameters reflecting albumin
and electrolyte levels affected by enteritis were observed. Overall, the results of
hematological and biochemical analyses prior to slaughter indicated no signs of inflammatory
reaction in 2 of the animals with EOE.</p>
    <p>EOE has previously been diagnosed in cattle [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] on the
basis of a combination of clinical and histopathological findings and exclusion of other
diseases. Additionally, we made a preliminary diagnosis of EOE in our 3 animals by considering
the clinical symptoms, including the response to corticosteroids and the results of clinical
examinations of blood and fecal samples to exclude differential disease diagnoses. The
diagnosis of EOE was confirmed by histopathological examination of intestinal tissues obtained
at slaughter after completion (27 and 30 months of age) of fattening.</p>
    <p>On the basis of clinical and examination results of the 3&#xA0;affected cattle in the present
study, the following antemortem predictive diagnostic criteria and/or clinical characteristics
of bovine EOE are proposed: (1) chronic obstinate diarrhea persisting until 27&#x2212;30 months of
age; (2) maintenance of good growth rates; (3) excretion of spherical tissues including
eosinophils in feces; (4) normal WBC, eosinophil counts, total protein and A/G ratio; and (5)
good therapeutic response to corticosteroids. Eosinophilia, hypoalbuminemia and
hyperglobulinemia have been suggested as useful parameters in the diagnosis of EOE based on
hematological and biochemical examination results [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].
Additionally, it has been suggested that there is a strong relationship between the clinical
and biochemical findings and the degree of eosinophilic infiltration of intestinal layers in
EOE-affected animals [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the present study, the
results of hematological and serum biochemical examinations in our 3 cattle cases were within
normal ranges, which was in agreement with a previous report in cattle by Cebra <italic>et
al</italic>. [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although the reasons for the
discrepancies between the results of hematological and serum biochemical examinations and the
chronic symptoms exhibited by the affected cattle are obscure, this finding suggests the
possible pathophysiology in EOE-affected cattle. Additionally, histopathological examination
of the intestinal tissues from the 3 animals indicated marked infiltration of eosinophils,
lymphocytes and plasma cells in the lamina propria of the mucosa, with occasional extension of
the infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells into the submucosa or muscular layer of the
jejunum, ileum and large intestine, which might be in line with the previous report by Cebra
<italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, the clinical
symptoms of our patients differed from those in the report by Cebra <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] regarding 2 parameters: (1) maintenance of good
growth rates and (2) excretion of carneous tissue. Cebra <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] suggested that there is a wide spectrum of clinical
symptoms in EOE in cattle; this might explain these differences. Cebra <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] diagnosed EOE in 2 out of 4 affected cattle during
the antemortem period by examining excisional biopsy samples obtained during exploratory
laparotomy via a right-flank incision, and administration of corticosteroids was initiated on
the basis of an objective diagnosis. Allowing for evidence-based medicine and animal-welfare
issues in cattle with chronic illness, endoscopic observation and biopsy of the large
intestine after a preliminary diagnosis of EOE has been made may enable timely confirmation
and appropriate treatment of EOE in JB cattle.</p>
    <p>The underlying cause and pathophysiologic mechanism of EOE have not been determined in humans
and animals [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; possible proposed causes include food allergies
and endoparasitism. Interestingly, the typical symptoms of chronic diarrhea continued in the
heifer in Case 3 from the lactation period to slaughter, indicating that food allergies are a
possible cause of EOE from birth to maturity in cattle. Expansion of the clinical database of
bovine EOE is needed to clarify the etiology of this disease.</p>
    <p>Administration of corticosteroids has been reported to be effective for the relief of
clinical symptoms of EOE in humans [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and certain
animal species [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and may be useful for the
elimination of certain differential disease diagnoses in cattle practice. In our study,
dexamethasone administration was initiated in one case in the lactation period, and the series
of treatments were repeated when the diarrhea returned. Cebra <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] reported that long-term administration of corticosteroid
with gradually diminishing doses was effective for resolving diarrhea and maintaining growth
rates. Therefore, we assumed that administration of dexamethasone on recurrence of diarrhea
would have positive effects regarding the growth rate of the EOE cattle.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, to our knowledge, these cases are the first JB cattle cases of idiopathic EOE.
The excretion of spherical tissues in the feces may serve as an important and identifiable
clinical sign in affected cattle. Idiopathic EOE should be considered a differential diagnosis
in cases of chronic obstinate diarrhea in JB cattle.</p>
