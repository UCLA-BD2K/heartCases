        <p>Inhaled histamine used to measure airway responsiveness produces some side effects more frequently than does methacholine. It is possible that the inhaled histamine induces the side effects in asthmatics with increased end organ responsiveness to histamine. A 56-yr-old woman with chronic idiopathic angioedema presented with asthma-like symptoms. Methacholine challenge test was performed, with a negative result. Five days later, histamine inhalation test was done. FEV1 fell by 37% after inhalation of histamine concentration of 8 mg/mL. Immediately thereafter, severe angioedema on face, lips, and oropharyngeal area, foreign body sensation at throat, and hoarseness occurred. To assess end organ responsiveness to histamine, skin prick tests with doubling concentrations of histamine (0.03-16 mg/mL) were carried out on the forearm of the patient and six age- and sex-matched asthmatic controls. The wheal areas were measured. The patient showed greater skin responses than the controls. Regression analysis showed that the intercept and slope were greater than cut-off levels determined from six controls. The patient showed an increased skin wheal response to histamine, indicating the enhanced end organ responsiveness to histamine, which is likely to contribute to the development of the oropharyngeal angioedema by inhaled histamine.</p>
