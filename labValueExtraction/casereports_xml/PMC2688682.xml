    <p>A 42-year-old man presented with chest angina. He had exertion chest discomfort 1 month ago. He had no cardiovascular risk factors. Chest X-ray revealed no cardiomegaly. Electrocardiogram revealed ST-segment elevation in lead II, III, and aVF. Echocardiography showed hypokinesia in inferior wall with an ejection fraction of 45%. We diagnosed ST-elevation myocardial infarction in inferior wall. We performed a coronary angiography (CAG) for primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The CAG showed a significant stenosis with plaque rupture at bifurcation portion of postero-lateral branch and postero-descending branch of the right coronary artery (RCA), which is considered as infarct-related artery, and a significant stenosis at proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the left circumflex artery (LCX).</p>
    <p>The RCA lesion was pre-dilated and implanted (zotarolimus-eluting stent 3.5 &#xD7; 24 mm). After 3 days, we implanted two different stents at two significant lesions of LAD and LCX (LAD: sirolimus-eluting stent 3.5 &#xD7; 23 mm; LCX: paclitaxel-eluting stent 3.5 &#xD7; 24 mm) because of product delivery (<italic>Panels A</italic>, <italic>B</italic>, and <italic>C</italic>). We treated with aspirin 100 mg/day and clopidogrel 75 mg/day.</p>
    <p>Six months later, he was admitted at our hospital due to atypical chest pain. We performed CAG. Follow-up CAG revealed huge aneurysms around the stents in RCA and LCX and small aneurysm around the stent in LAD (<italic>Panels D</italic>, <italic>E</italic>, and <italic>F</italic>). The aneurysms were clearly visible on intravascular ultrasound (<italic>Panels G</italic>, <italic>H</italic>, and <italic>I</italic>). We decided to treat with medication of three anti-platelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel, and cilostazol) without additional intervention. He has been free of symptom until now.</p>
