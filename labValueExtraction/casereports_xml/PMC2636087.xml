      <abstract>
        <p>We report two cases of significantly large choroidal holes following
penetrating trauma that led to suprachoroidal migration of internal
tamponading agents during repair of retinal detachments with
proliferative vitreoretinopathy secondary to penetrating trauma.
In the first case, choroidal hole was a direct result of the injury
and was identified immediately after vitreoretinal surgery which
was done for traumatic retinal detachment with hemorrhagic
choroidal detachment. In the second case, the hole occurred over
a period of several months after the repair of traumatic retinal
detachment with silicone oil tamponade. This was attributed to
progressive fibrosis exerting traction on the bare choroid/retinal
pigment epithelium. Choroidal hole significant enough to cause
suprachoroidal migration of internal tamponading agents is a
very rare complication seen in eyes with posttraumatic retinal
detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy.</p>

    <p>Choroidal injury can occur following penetrating trauma which
can result in serous or hemorrhagic choroidal detachment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
The sclerochoroidal perforation site is usually associated with
considerable fibrosis. However, a patent choroidal hole leading
to suprachoroidal collection of internal tamponading agents
is a unique event. Our search of literature using the Medline
database failed to reveal a similar report. We report two such
cases.</p>
    <sec sec-type="">
      <title>Case Reports</title>
      <sec>
        <title>Case 1</title>
        <p>A 36-year-old male presented 20 days after scleral repair for
ruptured globe (left eye) following a traffic accident. Examination
at this stage revealed hyphema, aniridia, aphakia and vitreous
hemorrhage. Ultrasonography revealed hemorrhagic choroidal
detachment and retinal detachment. He underwent pars
plana vitrectomy and suprachoroidal blood drainage next
day. During surgery, the retina was found bunched up with
significant membrane formation on both sides of the retina.
After membrane peeling and 360-degree retinectomy, the
retina could be attached using perfluorocarbon liquids (PFCL).
Perfluorocarbon liquids-silicone oil exchange was done.
Shallow choroidal detachment persisted in the periphery, which
was attributed to residual choroidal hemorrhage.</p>
        <p>On the first postoperative day, a large bubble of PFCL was
seen on the retinal surface. He was taken up for resurgery in
seven days time and the bubble was removed while injecting
additional silicon oil. One day later, another large bubble
of PFCL was noted on the retinal surface. At this stage, the
choroidal hole was prominently made out with increased extent
of choroidal detachment in that quadrant. It was realized that
silicone oil and PFCL were trapped in the suprachoroidal space.
He was again taken up for surgery two weeks later. Silicone oil
and PFCL trapped in the suprachoroidal space were drained
externally using a relatively posteriorly placed sclerotomy. The
vitreous cavity was reinjected with silicone oil. Eighteen months
postoperatively the retina remained attached with recovery of
20/400 vision. However, the choroidal hole remained patent
[<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>]. The eye is still soft and hence silicone oil has not been
removed.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Case 2</title>
        <p>A seven-year-old girl presented with a four-day-old penetrating
injury (with needle) and endophthalmitis in her right eye. She
underwent emergency lensectomy and vitrectomy along with
intravitreal injection of antibiotics. The infection was gradually
controlled after repeated intravitreal injection of antibiotics
based on culture reports. She was seen to have developed
rhegmatogenous retinal detachment 10 days after the injury.
There was choroidal detachment and significant proliferative
vitreoretinopathy. During resurgery, a 360-degree relaxing
retinectomy had to be done in view of the incarceration of the
retina in the wound. Perfluorocarbon liquid was used to settle
the retina and was replaced with 1000 centistokes silicone oil.
Ten days postoperatively, a small bubble of PFCL was noted
in the vitreous cavity. At this stage, her best-corrected vision
was 20/60. Shallow choroidal detachment was also noted with a
relatively soft eye but with attached retina. Progressive recurrent
fibrosis occurred in the periphery, exerting traction on the retina
as well as on the bare choroid/retinal pigment epithelium
(RPE). Approximately six months after the first surgery, it was
decided to reoperate, in view of the progressive drop in vision
due to recurrent fibrosis and tractional retinal detachment.
The silicone oil was removed and membrane peeling was
done and the fibrosed edge of the previous retinectomy was
excised. Perfluorocarbon liquid was used to flatten the retina.
It was then noted that PFCL was entering the suprachoroidal
space through a choroidal hole located in the area of bare
choroid/RPE. Although external pressure at this site brought
the PFCL into the vitreous cavity, the space could not be totally
evacuated. Similarly, silicone oil, which was exchanged with
PFCL, also entered this space. Four months from this surgery,
she maintained 20/100 best-corrected vision. The eye was soft
with band keratopathy. The retina was attached. The choroidal
hole remained open with a pocket of choroidal detachment
noted near the hole [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>]. The silicone oil was seen filling
the vitreous cavity and extending into the pocket of choroidal
detachment.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Choroidal involvement in cases of penetrating trauma to eyes
can manifest as benign choroidal thickening, suprachoroidal
hematoma, choroidal detachment, suprachoroidal hemorrhage,
indirect and direct traumatic chorioretinal ruptures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> The
site of the choroidal injury invariably undergoes fibrosis and
never remains patent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> Our two cases illustrate an interesting
complication of severe trauma, wherein a patent choroidal
hole was noted at some stage in the management of the case.
In Case 1, the hole was small initially and went unrecognized.
The migration of a large bubble of PFCL into the vitreous
cavity postoperatively on two occasions provided a clue to the
entrapment of the fluid elsewhere. The choroidal hole became
larger and prominent with increasing fibrosis. The fibrosis also
prevented sclerochoroidal approximation in the vicinity of the
hole, leading to persistent choroidal detachment in the area into
which the silicone oil freely migrated.</p>
      <p>In the second case, the hole was identified intraoperatively,
only during the second surgery done six months after the injury.
The hole presumably formed due to the traction by fibrosis that
covered the bare sclera/RPE beyond the retinectomy edge, not
an uncommon occurrence after large relaxing retinectomies. It is
possible that the areas of choroidal atrophy and thinning can give
way and progressively enlarge to form a choroidal hole in the
presence of significant traction. Presence of silicone oil may not be
a special concern but entrapment of PFCL could be problematic,
since the surgeon is never sure as to the complete removal of the
same at the conclusion of the surgery. Being heavier than water,
PFCL gravitates down and could escape notice.</p>
      <p>These two cases highlight an unreported occurrence of
choroidal hole formation leading to suprachoroidal collection
of tamponading agents such as PFCL and silicone oil. Both the
cases also had hypotony caused possibly by severe fibrosis
on the ciliary body. The combination of penetrating injury
leading to choroidal damage and the significant proliferative
vitreo-retinopathy that is associated with this situation can
potentially lead to choroidal hole formation due to the severe
traction. The presence of such a hole can complicate the surgical
management of these eyes.</p>
