        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> is an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes a diversity of severe and debilitating diseases worldwide. Sporadic and ongoing outbreaks of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) strains among men who have sex with men (MSM) support the need for research on virulence factors associated with these organisms. Previous analyses have been limited to single genes or genomes of laboratory-adapted reference strain L<sub>2</sub>/434 and outbreak strain L<sub>2</sub>b/UCH-1/proctitis. We characterized an unusual LGV strain, termed L<sub>2</sub>c, isolated from an MSM with severe hemorrhagic proctitis. L<sub>2</sub>c developed nonfusing, grape-like inclusions and a cytotoxic phenotype in culture, unlike the LGV strains described to date. Deep genome sequencing revealed that L<sub>2</sub>c was a recombinant of L<sub>2</sub> and D strains with conserved clustered regions of genetic exchange, including a 78-kb region and a partial, yet functional, toxin gene that was lost with prolonged culture. Indels (insertions/deletions) were discovered in an <italic>ftsK</italic> gene promoter and in the <italic>tarp</italic> and <italic>hctB</italic> genes, which encode key proteins involved in replication, inclusion formation, and histone H1-like protein activity, respectively. Analyses suggest that these indels affect gene and/or protein function, supporting the <italic>in vitro</italic> and disease phenotypes. While recombination has been known to occur for <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> based on gene sequence analyses, we provide the first whole-genome evidence for recombination between a virulent, invasive LGV strain and a noninvasive common urogenital strain. Given the lack of a genetic system for producing stable <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> mutants, identifying naturally occurring recombinants can clarify gene function and provide opportunities for discovering avenues for genomic manipulation.</p>

        <title>IMPORTANCE</title>
        <p>Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a prevalent and debilitating sexually transmitted disease in developing countries, although there are significant ongoing outbreaks in Australia, Europe, and the United States among men who have sex with men (MSM). Relatively little is known about LGV virulence factors, and only two LGV genomes have been sequenced to date. We isolated an LGV strain from an MSM with severe hemorrhagic proctitis that was morphologically unique in tissue culture compared with other LGV strains. Bioinformatic and statistical analyses identified the strain as a recombinant of L<sub>2</sub> and D strains with highly conserved clustered regions of genetic exchange. The unique culture morphology and, more importantly, disease phenotype could be traced to the genes involved in recombination. The findings have implications for bacterial species evolution and, in the case of ongoing LGV outbreaks, suggest that recombination is a mechanism for strain emergence that results in significant disease pathology.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> is responsible for a broad spectrum of diseases in males and females of all age groups worldwide. <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> is the leading cause of preventable blindness in tropical developing countries and the leading global cause of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Over 92 million individuals are infected with <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> in the urogenital tract annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In the United States alone, more than 1 million cases are reported each year, although the actual rates are estimated to be 2.8 million due to the deficiencies in screening and reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported that these infections result in an annual cost to Americans of over $10&#xA0;billion.</p>
      <p>The complications of urogenital infection include tubal factor infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. The lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) strains of <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> are considered biological variants of the organism and cause invasive disease such as genital ulcers, hemorrhagic proctitis, rectal fistulae, and suppurative lymphadenitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). LGV is prevalent in developing countries and represents a neglected tropical disease. To date, five different strains of LGV have been identified: L<sub>1</sub> to L<sub>3</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>a, and L<sub>2</sub>b.</p>
      <p>Infection is initiated at the mucosal epithelia by host cell endocytosis of the infectious but metabolically inert elementary body (EB). Following cell entry, the EB expands into the replicative form termed the reticulate body (RB) within a nonacidified inclusion. Over 30 <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> proteins are secreted into the membrane of the inclusion, including a family of inclusion proteins of which IncA is the best described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). IncA is thought to be critical for fusion of independent inclusions that form when more than one&#xA0;EB enters the same host cell.</p>
      <p>The mechanism for ascension to upper genital tract tissues remains ill described. While LGV strains have not been identified in endometrial or fallopian tube tissue, they are known to cause ulceration, invade the basal layers, and travel via the lymphatic system to regional draining lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). There have been sporadic and ongoing outbreaks of LGV among men who have sex with men (MSM) in many developed countries worldwide where, historically, the rates of LGV have been extremely low. The first reported outbreak occurred in Rotterdam, Netherlands, in 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Additional outbreaks were reported to occur in the United States, Europe, and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The majority of these infected men had engaged in high-risk behavior, were HIV positive, and presented with painful hemorrhagic proctitis, discharge, and, in some cases, constipation. There was a surprising absence of genital ulcers and the inguinal syndrome.</p>
      <p>In 2005, a novel LGV strain, termed L<sub>2</sub>b, which was associated with both symptomatic and asymptomatic disease, was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>); the genome was subsequently sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). While a similar strain based on <italic>ompA</italic> genotyping was detected among isolates dating back to the 1980s in San Francisco, CA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), the degree of genome homology between the two is not known. L<sub>2</sub>b strains have also recently been reported to occur in urethritis cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). These cumulative findings, especially the association of L<sub>2</sub>b with different disease presentations, and the availability of only two LGV genomes (L<sub>2</sub>/434 and L<sub>2</sub>b/UCH-1/proctitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]), suggest that further analyses of the morphological, molecular, and genetic characteristics of clinical LGV strains are warranted to identify virulence factors and understand the microbial nature of the outbreaks. The purpose of the current study was to advance these objectives by characterizing the cellular biology and genomics of an LGV isolate from an HIV-negative MSM who had severe hemorrhagic proctitis.</p>
      <p>We isolated a unique LGV strain from the MSM that was discovered to be a recombinant of invasive L<sub>2</sub> and noninvasive D strains. We present the first computational and statistical whole-genome evidence for recombination in this pathogen. Our findings have implications for bacterial evolution and, in the case of ongoing LGV outbreaks, suggest that recombination is a mechanism for strain emergence that results in significant disease pathology. While we do not know the molecular clock for these events, the results suggest either that the recombinant was produced in the rectal mucosa of our patient prior to sampling or that a clonal population of L<sub>2</sub> and D recombinants had already emerged and was circulating among the patient&#x2019;s core sexual group. Methods for direct genome sequencing of the organisms present in various tissues will be required to fully ascertain the diversity and recombinant nature of <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> strain infections and their associated disease phenotypes.</p>

        <title>Morphological characteristics of reference and clinical LGV strains.</title>
        <p>We compared the morphological characteristics of reference strains D/UW3, L<sub>1</sub>/440, L<sub>2</sub>/434, L<sub>2</sub>a/TW-396, and L<sub>3</sub>/404, clinical strain L<sub>2</sub>b, and a clinical isolate from the rectal mucosa of an MSM from this study, termed L<sub>2</sub>c, in culture using HeLa229 cells and confocal fluorescence microscopy (see Materials and Methods). Reference strains refer to <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> organisms that were isolated many decades ago, have been propagated since then, and are considered laboratory adapted. At 24&#xA0;h, L<sub>2</sub>/434 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig.&#xA0;1A</xref>) and L<sub>1</sub>/440, L<sub>2</sub>a/TW-396, L<sub>3</sub>/404, and L<sub>2</sub>b (not shown) produced large inclusions with IncA-containing fibers extending to secondary inclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig.&#xA0;1A</xref>, arrowheads). D/UW3 had smaller inclusions than L<sub>2</sub>/434 at 24&#xA0;h but a similar-sized inclusion at 48&#xA0;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig.&#xA0;1B</xref>), with IncA staining at all time points. In contrast, L<sub>2</sub>c formed multiple smaller inclusions that did not fuse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig.&#xA0;1C</xref>, arrows); there was no evidence for IncA staining, IncA-containing fibers, or fusion of inclusions during the course of development at 12, 18, or 24&#xA0;h for L<sub>2</sub>c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig.&#xA0;1C and 1D</xref>) (data not shown for 12 and 18 h). We found that <italic>incA</italic> mRNA was expressed for strains L<sub>2</sub>/434, D/UW3, and L<sub>2</sub>c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig.&#xA0;1E</xref>), despite the absence of IncA staining for L<sub>2</sub>c.</p>

The peak was also at 24&#xA0;h for L<sub>2</sub>c but was much lower than for L<sub>2</sub>, while the peak for D/UW3 was at 48&#xA0;h and lower than for L<sub>2</sub>/434 but higher than for L<sub>2</sub>c.</p>

        <title>Cytotoxic characteristics of reference LGV, reference D/UW3, and clinical L<sub>2</sub>c strains.</title>
        <p>Because of the difference in morphological characteristics between LGV and L<sub>2</sub>c strains and previous reports of nonfusing strains being less virulent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), we hypothesized that other LGV strains would be more cytotoxic than L<sub>2</sub>c. We also assayed the D/UW3 strain given the probability that the partial toxin gene was acquired from a D strain (described below). The cytopathic effects of each strain were determined by infecting monolayers of HeLa cells with each strain independently using a toxicity assay (see Materials and Methods). Infections were visualized by light microscopy after 4&#xA0;h. Surprisingly, the cellular effects of L<sub>2</sub>/434 showed far less cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig.&#xA0;2A</xref>) than those of L<sub>2</sub>c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig.&#xA0;2B</xref>) or D/UW3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig.&#xA0;2C</xref>), the latter two of which had significantly higher numbers of cells that underwent rounding, detachment, and lysis (score, 3+) than L<sub>2</sub>/434 (100% versus &lt;10%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 for both). By Western blot anlaysis, we show toxin protein production for D/UW3 and L<sub>2</sub>c but not for L<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig.&#xA0;2G</xref>).</p>

(A) There were no cytopathic effects for L<sub>2</sub>/434 (original magnification, &#xD7;400). (B) A significantly higher number of cells with rounding, detachment, and lysis were observed for L<sub>2</sub>c (original magnification, &#xD7;400). (C) The findings for D/UW3 were similar to those for L<sub>2</sub>c as shown in panel B (original magnification, &#xD7;400). After prolonged passage (see Materials and Methods), the cytopathic effects of L<sub>2</sub>c were lost (E) in comparison to those for D/UW3 (F). The morphology now resembled that of L<sub>2</sub>/434 (D). (G) Toxin protein expression demonstrated by Western blot analysis. D/UW3, L<sub>2</sub>c, and L<sub>2</sub>/434 were grown in HeLa cells at an MOI of 100, purified, run on a precast 4 to 12% gel, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and reacted with polyclonal antiserum against recombinant CT166 (see Materials and Methods). Lanes represent purified EBs. Both D/UW3 and L<sub>2</sub>c showed strong reactivity to a protein at ~73&#xA0;kDa that is close to the predicted 74.8&#xA0;kDa size of CT166; there was no protein expression for L<sub>2</sub>/434.</p>

        <p>A puzzling feature of the recombinant regions was a persistent background of reads with bases similar to those of L<sub>2</sub>/434. We plotted the number of nucleotide variants at each of the 7,982 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between D/UW3 and L<sub>2</sub>/434 (see Materials and Methods). At 6,527 (82%) of the known SNP positions, all nucleotide reads had the L<sub>2</sub>/434 variant base rather than that of D/UW3. At the other 18% of the known SNP positions, D-like variants were either approximately 50% or significantly above zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig.&#xA0;3</xref>, red bars, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table&#xA0;1</xref>, regions 2, 3, 5, and 6). It is probable that these SNPs were introduced through gene conversion of localized segments with a D-like ancestor. The Circos plot highlights candidate recombinant regions of L<sub>2</sub>c that match to D/UW3 or L<sub>2</sub>/434 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig.&#xA0;5</xref>). A further 235 variant positions in two regions were not known variants between L<sub>2</sub>/434 and D/UW3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig.&#xA0;3</xref>, blue bars, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table&#xA0;1</xref>, regions 1 and 7) and may have arisen through recombination with a strain significantly different from D/UW3 or with a D strain that has variant sequences in those regions. However, comparison of L<sub>2</sub>c with another D strain that was recently genome sequenced [D(s)/2923; GenBank accession no. NZ_ACFJ00000000] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) showed similar results. The distribution of SNPs was almost identical to that for D/UW3 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fS2">Fig.&#xA0;S2</xref> in the supplemental material). In fact, fewer D(s)/2923 SNPs match (7,565 SNPs, versus 7,982 for D/UW3).</p>

        <p>The likely explanation for these results is that an L<sub>2</sub> strain acquired DNA segments from a D strain and either one other <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> strain or a D strain variant through gene conversion in the patient. The patterns of SNP discovery could not have been produced by accidental mixing of strain D and L<sub>2</sub> genomic DNA in the laboratory before genome sequencing. If that were the case, all D-like SNPs would have had the same frequency in the chromosome and plasmid. Instead, more than 80% of the SNPs were not seen at all, and 18% of the variants were found at frequencies of greater than 15%. Furthermore, the extent of recombination and conservation of the recombinant regions would have had to have occurred in relatively few culture generations along with elimination of any contaminating D or other donor strains, since donor strains were not seen even with high-redundancy sequencing (75-fold). Also, all SNPs between L<sub>2</sub>c and L<sub>2</sub>/434 were within the boundaries of the seven discrete recombinant regions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table&#xA0;1</xref>). Outside these regions, there was no intrinsic genetic variation in the genome backbones of L<sub>2</sub>c and L<sub>2</sub>/434-LGV strains isolated in California more than 30&#xA0;years apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Finally, all 10 plaque-purified clones screened by <italic>ompA</italic> and typed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) as L<sub>2</sub> had no minor contaminating base peaks.</p>

        <title>Analyses of recombinant regions.</title>
        <p>As described above, we identified seven putative recombinant regions within the L<sub>2</sub>c genome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table&#xA0;1</xref>). The regions were independently analyzed and confirmed using Sanger sequencing (see Materials and Methods).</p>
        <p>Region 1 contained SNPs in ~20% of the reads that match a mixture of D-like and non-D-like variants, suggesting that the DNA source was not a D strain. Comparison of L<sub>2</sub>c with D(s)/2923 also did not reveal a match in this region. However, since only two D strains [reference D/UW3 and clinical D(s)/2923] have been genome sequenced to date and the distributions of SNPs are almost identical to each other, it is possible that other strains within the D cluster may match this region.</p>
        <p>In region 2, from the middle of the <italic>sufB</italic> gene, the proportion of reads with SNPs rose to 70 to 90% for variants entirely D-like, continuing for 78&#xA0;kb and including a 16S rRNA operon. The <italic>ftsK</italic> gene, a complement gene involved in cytokinesis, was in this region, reading from the 3&#x2032;-to-5&#x2032; side of the genome origin of replication. The IGR sequence upstream of <italic>ftsK</italic> was annotated using the Bacterial PROMoter and BDGP programs; two putative promoters were identified at alignment coordinates 45 to 168 and 310 to 484, respectively, upstream of the start codon (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fS3">Fig.&#xA0;S3</xref> in the supplemental material). Both predictions had significant scores. A 33-nt deletion in the promoter at nt 406 was present for L<sub>2</sub>c, D/UW3 and ocular strains compared to what was observed for L<sub>2</sub>/434 and L<sub>2</sub>b/UCH-1/proctitis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fS3">Fig.&#xA0;S3</xref>), although the significance of these findings in terms of gene regulation is unknown.</p>
        <p>Region 3 was a small recombinant region centered on the <italic>glgB</italic> gene, part of the glycogen biosynthetic pathway.</p>
        <p>Region 4 contained a large insertion of 1,915&#xA0;nt representing a partial toxin gene (CT166 in D/UW3) at the 5&#x2032; end not present in any LGV strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig.&#xA0;6</xref>). ClustalW alignment revealed that the region of CT165 to CT168 was almost identical to that of D/UW3. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments revealed expression of the toxin with a cytotoxic phenotype in HeLa cells for L<sub>2</sub>c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig.&#xA0;2B</xref>) but not for the other LGV strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig.&#xA0;2A</xref>) (see Materials and Methods). After 20 passages of L<sub>2</sub>c in tissue culture, the toxin insertion was lost. The cytotoxicity assay was repeated for the passaged isolate, and there was no observed cytopathic effect for L<sub>2</sub>c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig.&#xA0;2E</xref>) (see Materials and Methods) or L<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig.&#xA0;2D</xref>); D/UW3 maintained a cytotoxic effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig.&#xA0;2F</xref>).

        <p>Region 5 contained a deletion of 216&#xA0;nt (72&#xA0;amino acids) located in a region of the <italic>hctB</italic> gene, which encodes a histone H1-like protein, Hc2, and differentiates ocular, noninvasive, and LGV disease groups from one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fS4">Fig.&#xA0;S4</xref> in the supplemental material).

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The last decade has seen a cumulative increase in the evidence for recombination and horizontal gene transfer (LGT) among intracellular bacteria, and <italic>Chlamydia</italic> has been no exception to this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Data on recombination for <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> have come solely from extensive comparative analyses of multiple genes dispersed throughout the genome for reference and clinical strains. However, the authors of two recent publications of different <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> clinical isolates that were genome sequenced concluded that there were regions of the genomes that were consistent with interstrain recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Here, we provide the first analytically confirmed whole-genome evidence for recombination between <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> strains and, surprisingly, between invasive (LGV) and noninvasive urogenital strains. This provokes a reassessment of how we think about <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> infections and their evolution <italic>in vivo</italic>. We know that there are many diverse microbes that inhabit the rectum. However, it has not been considered that <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> strains coinfect the rectal mucosal with any relevant frequency, unlike the urethra or cervix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), and undergo LGT to produce recombinants.</p>
      <p>Our study was also informative in showing how laboratory processing of <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> strains after isolation from the patient skewed understanding of the nature of the infection. Initially, the L<sub>2</sub>c culture exhibited toxicity to HeLa cells and expressed the toxin protein. In addition, an intact D-like toxin gene was recovered by PCR and Sanger sequencing of the L<sub>2</sub>c genome. These data suggested a correlation with the clinical severity of disease. After multiple passage in cell culture, the cytotoxic phenotype was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>), likely representing selection against the cytopathic clone in culture, and we could not detect the toxin gene in the genome sequencing project using the passaged isolate. The conclusion from this experience is that ideally, in order to fully grasp the complexity of <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> infections, including the frequency and diversity of recombinants, techniques for direct genome sequencing (without prior amplification) of the organisms present in infected tissue will be needed.</p>
      <p>IncA is an important constituent of the inclusion membrane, facilitating the fusion of inclusions within the cell. Variants of <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> strains B, D to H, Ia, and J that completely lack <italic>incA</italic> or lack a portion of the gene produce multiple inclusions that do not fuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). The possible benefits of fusogenic inclusions include interaction with host cell vesicle trafficking and genetic exchange between the DNA from different RBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), although it has been reported that nonfusogenic strains can undergo recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), as has been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> between nonfusogenic and wild-type strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Interestingly, patients infected with naturally occurring <italic>incA</italic> &#x201C;knockouts&#x201D; or mutants have fewer signs and symptoms, lower proliferative capacity, and fewer inclusion-forming units (IFUs) in culture than wild-type fusing strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). L<sub>2</sub>c failed to express IncA at any time during development and produced many small nonfusogenic inclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig.&#xA0;1</xref>). In contrast to the majority of asymptomatic cases caused by other nonfusogenic strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), L<sub>2</sub>c was hypervirulent in terms of clinical signs and symptoms, producing severe hemorrhagic proctitis, although the patient did not exhibit an inguinal syndrome, which may in part be due to the presence of a functional cytotoxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>) (discussed below). The L<sub>2</sub>c sequence of <italic>incA</italic> was identical to that of L<sub>2</sub>/434, and <italic>incA</italic> mRNA expression levels were similar for both strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig.&#xA0;1E</xref>), which suggests that there may be a disruption in regulation for protein processing. Recent studies of the transcription expression profile and cell culture kinetics of naturally occurring IncA knockout and wild-type strains suggest that the IncA-negative phenotype may arise from multistep events, involving a decrease in transcription level and/or a partial or complete inactivation of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Alternatively, host environmental clues may be necessary for regulation, as has been discovered for certain proteins among other human Gram-negative pathogens, such as <italic>Burkholderia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p>
      <p>While the genomes of <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> strains to date are relatively conserved and share a high degree of synteny, an exception to this is found in the plasticity zone (PZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The PZ is typically rich in heterogeneity, with evidence for genome rearrangement as well as LGT for many bacterial species, including <italic>Bartonella grahamii</italic>, <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, and <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). The chlamydial PZ contains metabolic and virulence factors associated with tissue tropism and immune evasion, including the toxin loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Here, we consider it likely that the partial toxin gene was acquired from coinfection with a D strain, since no LGV sequences (<italic>n</italic> = 6) to date contain a partial or complete toxin gene. Indeed, D strains are prevalent in rectal infections among MSM. A recent study in Sweden of <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> infections among 197 MSM identified high prevalences of strains G (45%), D (27%), and J (26%) in the rectum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), although there was no information on the presence of mixed infections or coinfection with LGV strains. Importantly, the genomic uptake of DNA by transformation can occur during coinfection or sequential infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Transformation is a likely mechanism employed by <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic>, which would provide vast opportunities for genetic exchange.</p>
      <p>We also found that the toxin acquired by L<sub>2</sub>c was functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>). In our cytotoxicity assay, L<sub>2</sub>c had a profound effect on cell morphology and death, as did D/UW3, compared with L<sub>2</sub>/434. This effect was similar to that noted previously for strain D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). The <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> toxin is known to play an important role in damaging host cell actin microfilaments, likely facilitating growth of the intracellular inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Analyses of the toxin loci of <italic>Chlamydia muridarum</italic>, a mouse pathogen, have suggested that the toxin may function during an early phase of infection to inactivate GTPase near sites of EB entry, resulting in innate immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Consequently, introduction of the functional toxin into L<sub>2</sub>c may support a mechanism for survival through escaping immune surveillance and allowing sufficient replication in nonfusing inclusions to cause severe localized mucosal disease as in our patient. Moreover, the relatively high degree of cytotoxicity may result in barriers to dissemination to regional lymph nodes and, thereby, a lack of an inguinal syndrome. While L<sub>2</sub>c does not appear to be more cytotoxic than D/UW3, some degree of cytotoxicity may limit the ability to successfully culture these and other strains with a partial or complete toxin gene, which could potentially hinder our abilities to detect emerging LGV strains that contain the toxin and to further characterize them.</p>
      <p>Tarp is secreted via the type III secretion system (TTSS), present in both EBs and RBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), at sites of entry into the host cell for purposes of pathogen-directed actin polymerization and cytoskeleton rearrangement, an event that coincides with EB entry into the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). While the L<sub>2</sub>c <italic>tarp</italic> gene sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree imply a close genetic relationship with L<sub>2</sub>/434 and L<sub>2</sub>b/UCH-1/proctitis strains, L<sub>2</sub>c contains a large in-frame deletion. Based on our analyses, the L<sub>2</sub>c <italic>tarp</italic> gene is likely a recombinant of L<sub>2</sub> and D strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig.&#xA0;7</xref>).</p>
      <p>According to functional studies of the chlamydial Tarp protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), tyrosine phosphorylation has been associated with actin recruitment and inclusion development, while the number of tyrosine-rich repeat regions has been associated with functionality. But inhibition of Tarp tyrosine kinase activity had no effect on EB entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Thus, the presence of only two partial and two complete regions of tyrosine-rich repeats in the L<sub>2</sub>c Tarp, compared to six complete regions in other LGV strains (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fS7">Fig.&#xA0;S7</xref> in the supplemental material), would not prevent pathogen entry but might affect cytoskeletal rearrangement that could impair inclusion development and result in smaller inclusions, as observed for L<sub>2</sub>c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig.&#xA0;1C</xref>). If this is found to be a common recombinant region for clinical strains, it would highlight an evolutionary mechanism for diversifying the number of tyrosine residues to affect intracellular growth and infection outcomes. Indeed, recent sequence analysis of the <italic>tarp</italic> gene from numerous clinical strains found mutations that were similar among strains causing the same disease, and phylogenetic analysis suggested that this is one of the few genes that are responsible for <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic>-specific disease phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Inferior actin recruitment may also be correlated with a lack of IncA expression and function, which would affect inclusion fusion as in L<sub>2</sub>c.</p>
      <p>During the late stage in the developmental cycle, <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> expresses two histone H1 homologues that are involved in RB-to-EB transition through nucleoid compaction and downregulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fS5">Fig.&#xA0;S5</xref> in the supplemental material, the molecular mass and repetitive pentapeptide motifs of Hc2 are inversely correlated with the size of the deletion; thus, there are variable numbers among the <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The deletion in L<sub>2</sub>c Hc2 resulted in a substantial decrease in pentapeptide motifs and also in the number of positively charged amino acids in two-thirds of the Hc2 amino terminus. According to <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showing the DNA-binding activity of L<sub>2</sub>/434 Hc2 expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), the lower number of repetitive motifs in L<sub>2</sub>c Hc2 may weaken electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions of Hc2 with DNA, which may affect transcriptional regulation. Moreover, while ocular and D/UW3 strains contain a proline at coordinate 153 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fS5">Fig.&#xA0;S5</xref>, denoted in bold and underlined), which creates a &#x201C;kink&#x201D; in protein structure allowing Hc2 to participate in stronger interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), the lack of proline in L<sub>2</sub>c Hc2 (P153T) suggests weaker DNA-binding activity. Consequently, inefficient repression of gene expression would likely impede RB-to-EB differentiation and may in part explain the poor propagation rate and morphological characteristics of L<sub>2</sub>c in culture.</p>
      <p>A significant fraction of <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> genomes have unknown function, and the implied function of many genes is based on sequence similarity to homologous genes from other prokaryotes and a few eukaryotes. While there have been numerous attempts to produce stable mutants of <italic>C.&#xA0;trachomatis</italic> without success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>), which has hindered our ability to obtain unambiguous information about gene function, the discovery of naturally occurring recombinants, such as L<sub>2</sub>c, can help clarify the functional importance of specific genes and disease phenotypes and pave the way towards identifying the underlying mechanisms of LGT for developing a gene transfer system for <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.</p>

The clinical sample was obtained from the rectal mucosa of a male who had a history of sex with men and presented with severe hemorrhagic proctitis. Briefly, a 26-year-old male presented to a San Francisco Bay area clinic with a complaint of severe rectal pain with blood on defecation. He described a series of encounters with homosexual men and unprotected anal receptive intercourse during the prior month until the onset of rectal pain 5&#xA0;days prior to the clinic visit. The rectal bleeding had commenced 1 day earlier. The man had a history of gonorrhea in the past but no other known STDs, no known exposure to men with known STDs, and no history of illicit drug use. He was reported to be HIV negative and had no other medical conditions, was not on any over-the-counter or prescription medications, and appeared to be in excellent health. On the physical exam, he was a well-appearing male, afebrile, and normotensive, with no evidence for an ulcerative lesion on the glans or shaft of the penis and no inguinal adenopathy. The anus was inflamed, and on proctoscopy, there was extensive bleeding of the mucosa, with evidence of a purulent discharge.

        <p>Growth curves for strains D/UW3, L<sub>2</sub>/434, and L<sub>2</sub>c were generated using quantitative PCR as we previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). Briefly, each strain at an MOI of 1 was grown in HeLa cells and harvested at 0, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 h, and total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed as described above. Each quantitative PCR consisted of 1&#xD7; SYBR green master mix (Applied Biosystems), 1&#xA0;&#xB5;l of cDNA, and 5&#xA0;pmol of each primer (16S rRNA and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH] as described in reference 56) in a total reaction volume of 25 &#xB5;l run on an ABI 7900 (Applied Biosystems) using our thermocycling profile as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>); standard curves were generated, and negative controls for each primer pair were included in each run as we previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). GAPDH was used for normalization. Melting curves were used to verify the specificity of the reactions and the absence of primer dimmers. Samples were amplified in triplicate where the mean was used for analysis. Three independent experiments were performed.</p>

        <p>Reference strains D/UW3 and L<sub>2</sub>/434 and the clinical L<sub>2</sub>c strain from this study were analyzed in a cytotoxicity assay adapted from the method of Belland et al. (42). HeLa cells were grown to 80% confluence as described above in 24-well plates. The monolayers were treated with 1&#xA0;ml DEAE-dextran (45&#xA0;&#xB5;g/ml) in Hanks&#x2019; balanced salt solution (HBSS) for 15&#xA0;min at 37&#xB0;C. The cells were infected at an MOI of 100 (~5 &#xD7; 10<sup>7</sup> IFU) with each strain and mock infected in duplicate at room temperature for 4&#xA0;h on an orbital shaker. The inocula were removed, and the cells were washed with HBSS and incubated for an additional 4&#xA0;h in growth medium as described above except for the addition of 10&#xA0;&#xB5;g/ml gentamicin (MP Biomedicals), 25&#xA0;&#xB5;g/ml vancomycin (Fisher) to prevent any nonchlamydial bacterial growth. The monolayers were visualized under light microscopy at &#xD7;400 magnification. The cells were scored for rounding, detachment, and lysis compared to the levels for uninfected control cells by the following metric: (&#x2212;), same as cell control; 3+, 100% of cells affected; 2+, 75% of cells affected; and 1+, 25% of cells affected.</p>
        <p>The above-described experiments were repeated using 1&#xA0;&#xB5;g/ml of doxycycline to pretreat cells before infection. In addition, the assay was repeated using L<sub>2</sub>/434 and a higher passage number (passage no. 20) for L<sub>2</sub>c. A total of two independent experiments were performed for each of these studies.</p>
        <p>To detect the toxin protein, a Western blot analysis was performed as we have previously described, with modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Briefly, L<sub>2</sub>/434, D/UW3, and L<sub>2</sub>c were independently grown in HeLa cells as described above at an MOI of 100. Purified EBs from each isolate were solubilized in Laemmli buffer, run on NuPAGE Novex 4 to 12% bis-Tris precast gels (Invitrogen) with a BenchMark prestained protein ladder (Invitrogen), and electrophoretically transferred onto a BioTrace polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Pall Life Science, Port Washington, NY) at 120&#xA0;V for 2&#xA0;h in 1&#xD7; NuPAGE transfer buffer (Invitrogen) with 10% methanol. The membrane was incubated with 5% skim milk in 1&#xD7; Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and 0.1% Tween 20, washed with 1&#xD7; TBS-0.1% Tween 20, and reacted overnight with a polyclonal antiserum against recombinant CT166 (gift from Harlan Caldwell) at a 1:500 dilution. The membrane was washed, and secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase [HRP]; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was applied at a 1:1,000 dilution, incubated at room temperature, and washed in 1&#xD7; TBS prior to detection using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (enhanced chemiluminescence [ECL] detection system; Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and CL-XPosure Film (Thermo Scientific).</p>

        <p>The purified genomic DNA from the clinical case was shotgun sequenced using a combination of the 454/Roche GS-FLX Titanium and GS Junior instruments (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT). The 809,874 reads were generated with an average read length of 404&#xA0;nt. Preliminary analysis suggested an unusually high proportion of contamination of DNA from the HeLa cell culture. Therefore, 618,844 reads of human origin were removed (identified by mapping to the hs19 golden path release of the genome [<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway">http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway</uri>]) using Newbler gsMapper 2.5 software.</p>
        <p>We assembled a random subset of 50,000 of the remaining reads <italic>de novo</italic> using the 454 gsAssembler software program, version 2.0.01.14, with default parameters. The order of the contigs in the final genome sequence was determined using a combination of the possible connections between contigs suggested by overlapping reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>) and information from mapping contigs against the L<sub>2</sub>/434 reference genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). After determination of the correct path through the contig graph, the contigs were assembled to form the final sequence. To accomplish this, the ends of adjoining contigs were matched using BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>) against the database of reads. Reads found in both contigs were assembled into a consensus sequence that bridged the two contigs to form a single, larger contig. The majority of gaps were small enough to be spanned by a single read. The plasmid was a single contig with reads overlapping the beginning and end, indicating the expected circular redundancy.</p>
        <p>For verification of the sequences, we aligned the original reads to the consensus chromosomal and plasmid templates using gsMapper 2.3; 91.6% of the 191,030 human screened reads (average length, 436&#xA0;nt) mapped to the chromosome, and 6.8% mapped to the plasmid. The remaining unmapped reads were found not to assemble <italic>de novo</italic> into any contigs consisting of more than 2 reads, suggesting that these were mostly contamination that had not matched the human reference sequence. The mapped assemblies were inspected to remove a small number of errors. The final assembly, with an average redundancy of coverage of approximately 75-fold, was used for annotation. The identity of each base in the final consensus sequence was determined by majority vote. The gsMapper software revealed two possible structural variants in a minority of sequence reads. The first was a deletion between coordinates 133542 and 155549 present in 4 sequence reads. The second was a deletion between bases 849581 and 849942 present in 19 sequence reads.</p>

        <title>Comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis.</title>
        <p>To detect recombination, we developed a program called Q-plotGenome that was written as a set of macros in the SAS software 9.2 language (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) to compare the genome sequences of L<sub>2</sub>c with those of reference strains L<sub>2</sub>/434 and D/UW3. The core of the program is similar to that of SimPlot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>) except that it covers the entire 1-Mb genome instead of a discrete sliding window of limited size; it samples a series of fixed-length subsequences (windows) from one genome and then compares them to windows from the other genome. Q-plotGenome is, thus, a tool for comparing DNA sequences in the range of 1&#xA0;Mb plus and for displaying results graphically. The description of Q-plotGenome is detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sS1">Text&#xA0;S1</xref> in the supplemental material.</p>
        <p>To identify statistically significant recombination breakpoints or regions, SimPlot software 3.5.1 (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://sray.med.som.jhmi.edu/SCRoftware/">http://sray.med.som.jhmi.edu/SCRoftware/</uri>) was utilized as we have previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The parameters included a window size of 200 base pairs (bp), a step of 20&#xA0;bp, neighbor-joining trees calculated using the Kimura-2-parameter distance model (60), and 1,000 bootstrap replicates to determine confidence for each branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig.&#xA0;7</xref>).</p>
        <p>For a global analysis, we used a version of the BLAST score ratio approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) to identify recombinants. We aligned the databases of both (i) raw L<sub>2</sub>c sequences and (ii) 100-nt windows along the L<sub>2</sub>c chromosome sequence separated by 50&#xA0;nt against the L<sub>2</sub>/434 genome as a reference and the other complete genomes listed in the previous section. Matches with a BLAST score ratio of &lt;0.95 were plotted using Circos software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig.&#xA0;5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>).</p>
        <p>For analysis of specific regions, nucleotide sequences were aligned by ClustalW 1.8, MUSCLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>), or MAUVE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>). Gaps were removed using GBLOCKS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>) with default parameters. Phylogenic inference and tree plotting were performed using the MEGA 3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>) package described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) or PHYLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>) programs DNApars, Seqboot, and Consensus. Neighbor-joining trees were calculated using the Kimura 2-parameter model that assumes constant nucleotide frequencies and their rates of substitution among sites (60) and 1,000 bootstrap replicates.</p>
        <p>For detection of strain D-specific SNPs within the L<sub>2</sub>c data, we first identified SNPs between the D/UW3 and L<sub>2</sub>/434 genomes using the show-snps tool of the MUMmer package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>). We then mapped L<sub>2</sub>c against L<sub>2</sub>/434 using gsMapper 2.3 and extracted the number of &#x201C;D&#x201D;-like and &#x201C;L<sub>2</sub>&#x201D;-like nucleotides at each variant position from the 454AllDiffs.txt output using a custom script.
