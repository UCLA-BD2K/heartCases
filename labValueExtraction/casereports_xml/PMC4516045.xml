          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is characterised by the presence of a fusion driver oncogene, <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic>, which is a constitutive tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the central treatment strategy for CML patients and have significantly improved survival rates, but the T315I mutation in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1 confers resistance to all clinically approved TKIs, except ponatinib. However, compound mutations can mediate resistance even to ponatinib and remain a clinical challenge in CML therapy. Here, we investigated a ponatinib-resistant CML patient through whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to identify the cause of resistance and to find alternative therapeutic targets.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Patients and methods</title>
          <p>We carried out WGS on a ponatinib-resistant CML patient and demonstrated an effective combination therapy against the primary CML cells derived from this patient <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Our findings demonstrate the emergence of compound mutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain following ponatinib treatment, and chromosomal structural variation data predicted amplification of <italic>BCL2</italic>. The primary CD34<sup>+</sup> CML cells from this patient showed increased sensitivity to the combination of ponatinib and ABT-263, a BCL2 inhibitor with a negligible effect against the normal CD34<sup>+</sup> cells.</p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Our results show the potential of personalised medicine approaches in TKI-resistant CML patients and provide a strategy that could improve clinical outcomes for these patients.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro" id="mdv110_s1"><title>introduction</title><p>Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is driven by a constitutive tyrosine kinase, <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic>, which results from a reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) in haemopoietic stem cells [<xref rid="MDV110C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the main treatment of CML and have improved disease management and survival [<xref rid="MDV110C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, resistance is a persistent clinical problem and a significant proportion of patients will progress on first-line therapy due to the emergence of TKI-resistant clones. In some patients, TKI resistance is mediated by BCR-ABL1-independent mechanisms, including increased BCL2 expression and overexpression of LYN kinase, but 20%&#x2013;30% of patients progress due to acquired point mutations in the <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> kinase domain that disrupt TKI binding. In particular, BCR-ABL1 p.T315I (the &#x2018;gatekeeper&#x2019; mutation) confers resistance to all approved first- and second-line TKIs, including imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib [<xref rid="MDV110C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="MDV110C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Notably, BCR-ABL1 p.T315I remains sensitive to the TKI ponatinib, a third-line inhibitor [<xref rid="MDV110C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although an initial response to ponatinib is promising in patients with single mutations in <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic>, response in advanced patients is limited because successive or long-term use of TKIs lead to the evolution of compound <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> kinase domain mutations that show resistance even to ponatinib [<xref rid="MDV110C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="MDV110C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. No fourth-line treatments have yet been approved for ponatinib-resistant CML.</p><p>We used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to characterise a ponatinib-resistant CML patient. This revealed a constellation of <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> mutations that were not detected in diagnostic Sanger sequencing approaches. The WGS approach also revealed amplification of the anti-apoptotic gene <italic>BCL2</italic> and we show that this patient's CML cells were susceptible to a ponatinib/ABT-263 combination, revealing a therapeutic strategy that may have been effective in this patient.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="mdv110_s2"><title>patients and methods</title><p>Detailed experimental procedures are in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdv110/-/DC1">supplementary Methods, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>. Briefly, tissues were collected following informed consent and ethical approval from the scientific subcommittee of the Manchester Cancer Research Centre Tissue Biobank and in compliance with the ethical and legal framework of the <italic>Human Tissue Act</italic>, 2004. Normal mobilised CD34<sup>+</sup> cells surplus to requirements were from patients undergoing chemotherapy and autologous transplantation for myeloma. Their use was authorised by the Salford and Trafford Research Ethics Committee, for samples collected since 2006, and following written informed consent of donors. Isolated CML CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were expanded <italic>ex vivo</italic> for genomic DNA extraction. Germline DNA was extracted from the buccal epithelial cells from the patient's fresh saliva. Total RNA from CML CD34<sup>+</sup> cells was used for RNA-seq and shot-gun cloning. WGS and RNA-seq were carried out on an Illumina HiSeq2500 in paired-end 100-bp runs, with 65&#xD7; depth for CML DNA and 35&#xD7; depth for germline DNA. Raw data are accessible via EGAS00001001150.

Validation and identification of single and compound mutations in the <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> kinase domain was by shot-gun cloning and Sanger sequencing [<xref rid="MDV110C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Annexin V apoptosis assays (BD Biosciences) and cell proliferation assays (CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution; Promega) were as per manufacturers' instructions. Colony forming cell (CFC) assays were used to examine CML CD34<sup>+</sup> cell differentiation following small molecule inhibitor treatments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="mdv110_s3"><title>results</title><p>We report on a patient in their 70s who presented with chronic phase CML. The patient was initially treated with imatinib (400 mg/day), which resulted in a complete haematological response (CHR), but failed to achieve a complete cytogenetic response (CCR) at 6 months (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV110F1">1</xref> A). Dose escalation of imatinib (600 mg/day), followed by the second-generation TKI dasatinib (100 mg/day), each for 6 months also failed to produce a CCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV110F1">1</xref>A) and due to nilotinib and interferon intolerance, the patient was again placed on standard-dose imatinib. <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> mutation analysis at this time demonstrated a C&gt;T, p.T315I mutation, but the patient was not considered suitable for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation due to co-morbidities. In the absence of haematological response, imatinib was discontinued and the patient was treated with hydroxycarbamide. Three years following diagnosis, the patient was treated with ponatinib (45 mg/day) and despite achieving a temporary CHR, a CCR was never achieved, and within 9 months the CHR was lost, as revealed by a rising white blood cell count. The patient was retreated with hydroxycarbamide, but developed leg ulceration necessitating discontinuation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV110F1">1</xref>A). The patient remains in chronic phase with disease control being achieved with intermittent etoposide (Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Limited, Uxbridge).

CML, chronic myeloid leukaemia; TKIs, tyrosine kinase inhibitors.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mdv11001"/></fig></p><p>To characterise further the patient's disease, we carried out WGS on CD34<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from blood 57 months after diagnosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV110F1">1</xref>A and B). The CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were 99.5% <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic><sup>+</sup> by FISH, and germline DNA was isolated from buccal epithelial cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV110F1">1</xref>A and B). We observed 12 466 predicted somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the patient's CML cells, resulting in 23 predicted non-synonymous mutations (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="MDV110TB1">1</xref>), a modest mutational burden that is similar to that seen in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), but considerably lower than that in cutaneous melanoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, and lung cancers, which are associated with known carcinogens (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV110F2">2</xref>A). Approximately 40% of the somatic mutations were C&gt;T (G&gt;A) transitions and approximately 20% T&gt;C (A&gt;G) transitions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV110F2">2</xref>B), also a common mutation signature in AML [<xref rid="MDV110C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Trinucleotide analysis of the mutant base and its flanking nucleotides (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV110F2">2</xref>C) revealed a match to the recently described mutational signature 1B, which is common in several cancers including AML, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), and B-cell lymphoma [<xref rid="MDV110C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

Notably, RNA-seq analysis revealed that only 12 of the 23 predicted SNVs were expressed and of the 4 previously reported in cancers (COSMIC, <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic">http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic</uri>), only <italic>ABL1</italic> (C&gt;T, p.T315I) and <italic>ABL1</italic> (T&gt;G, p.F359V) were expressed (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="MDV110TB1">1</xref>). The <italic>ABL1</italic> mutations are also the only missense SNVs that have been reported in CML (COSMIC) and have a damaging effect on protein function as predicted by SIFT and PolyPhen scores (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="MDV110TB1">1</xref>). We used a 10% threshold to call the SNVs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdv110/-/DC1">supplementary Methods, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>), so to detect lower-frequency SNVs in the <italic>ABL1</italic> kinase domain we set the detection limit to 0.1%, but did not detect any additional mutations. However, when we manually scanned this region in the Integrative Genomic Viewer (IGV v2.3.3.38), we observed an additional 53 low-frequency SNVs, but only 2 of these were validated by Sanger sequencing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdv110/-/DC1">supplementary Table S1, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>). To investigate this region further, we carried out PCR-mediated shot-gun cloning and Sanger sequencing of the <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> kinase domain [<xref rid="MDV110C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], comparing a pre-ponatinib sample from 21 months to the post-ponatinib sample obtained at 57 months. The p.T315I mutation was present in 100% of the clones from the pre-ponatinib sample and &#x223C;21% of these carried additional point mutations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV110F3">3</xref>B), including p.E225G/T315I and p.T315I/F359C compound mutations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdv110/-/DC1">supplementary Table S2, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>), which have been shown to mediate ponatinib resistance [<xref rid="MDV110C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Intriguingly, following ponatinib treatment, we observed a reduction of p.T315I to &#x223C;17% of the clones, with emergence of a new dominant clone (&#x223C;53%) carrying a p.F359V mutation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV110F3">3</xref>B). Moreover, following ponatinib, the number of compound mutations increased to &#x223C;45% and included p.T315I/M351V which also confers ponatinib resistance [<xref rid="MDV110C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdv110/-/DC1">supplementary Table S2, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>).

We also predicted 12 chromosomal translocations with the potential to generate fusion genes, 2 of which were the balanced t(9;22)(q34;q11) reciprocal translocations that create <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV110F3">3</xref>A and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdv110/-/DC1">supplementary Table S4, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>). However, our RNA-seq revealed that only <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> and <italic>ABL1-BCR</italic> were expressed, strongly suggesting that <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> was the driver oncogene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdv110/-/DC1">supplementary Table S4, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>) and that the other potential fusions were not pathogenic.</p><p>We predicted 53 large chromosomal deletions and 7 large chromosomal amplifications (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV110F3">3</xref>A). Two of the deletions and three of the amplifications affected coding regions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdv110/-/DC1">supplementary Table S5, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>). A large deletion of 5q23 is similar to that previously described in a blast crisis patient (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdv110/-/DC1">supplementary Table S5, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>), but we noted an &#x223C;8 Mb amplification of chromosome 18q that harbours the anti-apoptotic gene <italic>BCL2. BCL2</italic> upregulation is associated with sensitivity to BCL2 inhibitors, so we modelled this using two <italic>BCR-ABL1<sup>+</sup></italic> cell lines, BV173R and K562 cells. BV173R cells expressed approximately seven-fold more <italic>BCL2</italic> than K562 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV110F4">4</xref>A) and were significantly more sensitive to a BH3-mimetic BCL2 inhibitor, ABT-263 [<xref rid="MDV110C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV110F4">4</xref>B). We confirmed that <italic>BCL2</italic> expression was 14-fold higher in the patient's CD34<sup>+</sup> CML cells than normal mobilised CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV110F4">4</xref>A), and that the patient's CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were more sensitive to ABT-263 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV110F4">4</xref>B). Moreover, ponatinib and ABT-263 cooperated to increase apoptosis in the patient's CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV110F4">4</xref>C). These results were reflected in viability assays. Ponatinib and ABT-263 did not significantly suppress the viability of normal CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV110F4">4</xref>D), but both inhibited growth of the patient's CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and they cooperated to suppress the growth of these cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV110F4">4</xref>E). We also examined ABT-199, a second BCL2 inhibitor [<xref rid="MDV110C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. ABT-199 was less potent than ABT-263 at inducing apoptosis in the patient's CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdv110/-/DC1">supplementary Figure S1A, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>), but it nevertheless cooperated with ponatinib to enhance apoptosis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdv110/-/DC1">supplementary Figure S1B, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>). Next, we examined the differentiation capacity of the patient's CD34<sup>+</sup> cells that survived the drug treatments. In CFC assays, only &#x223C;5% of the control colonies were erythroid and &#x223C;95% were granulocytic, but the granulocytic fraction decreased to &#x223C;85% in the presence of ponatinib, to &#x223C;60% in the presence of ABT-263, and to only 24% in the presence of both drugs, a trend that was also observed with ABT-199 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV110F4">4</xref>F and G; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdv110/-/DC1">supplementary Figures S1C and S2, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>). Thus, in addition to inducing apoptosis and reducing viability, the ponatinib/ABT-263 combination selectively reduced production of granulocytic lineage cells, either by inducing lineage-specific apoptosis or differentiation of surviving cells down the erythroid lineage.

These mutations are thought to result from spontaneous deamination of 5-methyl-cytosine in germline and normal somatic cells [<xref rid="MDV110C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although the aetiology of these cells is unclear, this signature is age-related and particularly common in haematological malignancies including ALL, AML, CLL, and B-cell lymphoma [<xref rid="MDV110C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], suggesting a common somatic mutation mechanism in these diseases.</p><p>We observed a modest mutational burden, characteristic of cancers that are not associated with known carcinogens such as ultraviolet light or cigarette smoke. Moreover, the WGS revealed an ABL1 p.F359V mutation that was not detected by diagnostic Sanger sequencing. We confirmed the presence of this mutation by shot-gun cloning and Sanger sequencing, and it is unclear why the diagnostic Sanger sequencing did not reveal this mutation, but one possibility is that the wild-type codon is favoured for base incorporation and thereby masks the mutant allele. The shot-gun sequencing also revealed several compound mutations that were not identified by WGS, because read-length limitations only reveals these when they are within &#x223C;100 bases of each other. Finally, the shot-gun sequencing identified many low-frequency <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> kinase domain mutations that were not revealed by WGS, possibly because of low read-depth in our WGS or because they are PCR-generated artefacts of the shot-gun cloning. These observations highlight why a combination of sequencing approaches is desirable when performing these studies, but these considerations aside, our data suggest that there was dramatic treatment-driven clonal evolution. This presumably accounts for the failure to achieve a CCR despite the initial haematological response and is in agreement with recent data, showing that p.T315I TKI-resistant CML patients fail to respond to ponatinib due to emergence of compound <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> kinase domain mutations [<xref rid="MDV110C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It has also been reported that sequential TKI treatments in relapsed CML patients can drive clonal selection of <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> mutants that were present at a low frequency before treatment commenced [<xref rid="MDV110C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="MDV110C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The reciprocal t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation is the hallmark of CML [<xref rid="MDV110C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It was predicted by our WGS and RNA-seq results, and validated by our shot-gun cloning approach. The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene in this patient is the e14a2 isoform that occurs between exons 14 and 15 of <italic>BCR</italic>, generating the BCR-ABL1 p210 fusion protein. The importance of e13a2 and e14a2 isoforms to risk stratification at the time of diagnosis is debated, but it has been suggested that the e14a2-type CML cells can activate HLA-mediated T-cell response that can be exploited in IFN-&#x3B1; therapy [<xref rid="MDV110C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>It is unclear what contribution the large chromosomal structural variations (SVs) made towards the disease. A putative amplification of &#x223C;42 Mb on chromosome 6 harbours 370 genes, including 16 HLA family genes that modulate T-cell response towards leukaemic cells [<xref rid="MDV110C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This region also includes <italic>TNF</italic>, which modulates CML CD34<sup>+</sup> cell survival, and whose co-inhibition with BCR-ABL1 induces CML cell death [<xref rid="MDV110C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Importantly, we observed a putative &#x223C;8 Mb amplification on chromosome 18 that harbours <italic>BCL2</italic>, a pro-survival driver oncogene in B-cell lymphomas [<xref rid="MDV110C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. <italic>BCL2</italic> is important in CML pathogenesis, progression to blast crisis [<xref rid="MDV110C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="MDV110C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and its overexpression is associated with TKI resistance [<xref rid="MDV110C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. BCL2 inhibitors such as ABT-263 and ABT-199 are in phase 2 clinical trials [<xref rid="MDV110C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="MDV110C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We find that the chromosomal SV that leads to <italic>BCL2</italic> amplification in this patient was associated with elevated BCL2 expression and sensitivity to ABT-263 as has been reported for B-cell lymphomas and ALL cells harbouring an <italic>IGH-BCL2</italic> fusion or trisomy 18 [<xref rid="MDV110C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, in other reports, only a modest induction in apoptosis was seen with ABT-263 in <italic>BCR-ABL1<sup>+</sup></italic> CML cells without any effects on stem cell survival or self-renewal capacity [<xref rid="MDV110C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="MDV110C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Using cell lines, we show that the response to ABT-263 is correlated to high levels of <italic>BCL2</italic> and independent of <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> expression, supporting the conclusion that the response to ABT-263 we observed in the CML patient's CD34<sup>+</sup> cells is due to the <italic>BCL2</italic> amplification. This observation suggests BCR-ABL-dependent and BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms of resistance in this patient and notably, the patient's CML cells were highly sensitive to combined inhibition of both resistance pathways. Moreover, the cells that survived the combination treatment favoured erythroid over granulocytic lineage differentiation.</p><p>Thus, in summary, we describe the first WGS of CML. The patient developed ponatinib-resistant disease and our data suggest that the underlying mechanism was driven by compound <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> kinase domain mutations and <italic>BCL2</italic> overexpression. Our study describes an approach to personalised medicine for CML and we provide a proof-of-principle that the integration of WGS and functional studies can identify new combination treatments for patients who have failed even third-generation BCR-ABL1 inhibitors. Unfortunately, in this case, we were unable to translate our findings into patient's benefit because ABT-263 is not currently licensed.</p></sec><sec id="mdv110_s5"><title>funding</title><p>This work was supported by the <funding-source id="cs1" rid="cn1">Kay Kendall Leukaemia Fund</funding-source> (<award-id id="cn1" rid="cs1">KKL631</award-id>) and <funding-source id="cs2" rid="cn2">Cancer Research UK</funding-source> (<award-id id="cn2" rid="cs2">C15759/A12328</award-id>).</p></sec><sec id="mdv110_s6"><title>disclosure</title><p>The authors have declared no conflicts of interest.</p></sec>
