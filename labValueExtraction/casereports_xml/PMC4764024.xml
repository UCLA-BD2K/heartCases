      <title>Pancytopenia</title>
      <p content-type="flushleft">Pancytopenia is characterized by a decreased number of at least two blood cell lines. Pancytopenia may progress acutely, such as with decreased blood cell counts in fulminant sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or rapid hemolysis. Alternatively, pancytopenia may evolve insidiously over weeks to months. In this review we focus on the latter group of acquired and congenital pancytopenias in children.</p>
      <p>Chronic pancytopenia is a diagnostic challenge. The range of potential causes is bewildering, signs and symptoms overlap substantially, and many diseases presenting with pancytopenia are life-threatening if not recognized and managed properly. Therefore, clinicians must be familiar with clinical scenarios that should prompt evaluation of blood counts and a pediatric hematology referral.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>Causes</title>
        <p content-type="flushleft">Pancytopenia may be caused by decreased production or increased pooling or destruction of blood cells. These problems may be congenital or acquired (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p>

            <italic>Case 1</italic>
          </bold>
          <italic>: Bert is a previously healthy 4-year-old boy who is seeing his pediatrician for a health supervision visit. His mother mentions that for the last 3 weeks, he has been asking for pain medicines because &#x201C;his legs are hurting&#x201D;. Last Saturday Bert missed his baseball practice because he woke up with a nosebleed that stopped after 15 minutes of pressure, but &#x201C;he was too tired to play anyway.&#x201D; He spent most of the past week napping. His vital signs are normal except for a heart rate of 128 beats/min. His physical examination reveals a few scattered ecchymoses on shins, forearms, and lower back; dried blood in both nares; and a red, nonblanching pinpoint rash on his cheeks.</italic>
        </p>
        <p>Anemia has well-known clinical consequences: malaise, sleepiness, irritability, exercise intolerance, shortness of breath, and pallor. A rapid drop in red blood cell hemoglobin due to acute hemolysis may abruptly trigger clinical symptoms that are reminiscent of a large blood volume loss due to hemorrhage. In contrast, an insidious-onset anemia is associated with relatively mild symptoms as the cardiopulmonary and biochemical compensatory mechanisms activate over time.</p>
        <p>Leukopenia impairs the immune system&#x2019;s ability to fight infections. Neutropenia (low absolute neutrophil count [ANC]) is frequently encountered in clinical practice. Children with severe neutropenia (defined as ANC &lt;500/&#x3BC;L [0.5 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L]) face a high risk of life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections. Fever in a child who has neutropenia is a medical emergency, particularly in the context of acute neutropenia due to cancer chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. Evidence-based guidelines for the management of febrile neutropenia in children have been developed by an international expert panel. (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) Affected children must be evaluated emergently under the guidance of a pediatric hematologist-oncologist. Blood cultures must be obtained and empiric broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy started immediately.</p>
        <p>In the absence of trauma, a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) does not lead to clinical symptoms until the count decreases below 10 to 20 &#xD7; 10<sup>3</sup>/&#x3BC;L (10 to 20 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L). Children with severe thrombocytopenia develop spontaneous bruising, bleeding, and petechiae (small subcutaneous capillary hemorrhages). Menstruating females experience heavy and prolonged periods.</p>
        <p>
          <bold>
            <italic>Case 1, continued</italic>
          </bold>
          <italic>: Bert&#x2019;s signs and symptoms are concerning for pancytopenia of potentially ominous etiology. Bruised shins are common in active toddlers, but ecchymoses on the forearms and lower back as well as facial petechiae are suggestive of thrombocytopenia. (A possibility of child abuse should always be kept in mind when evaluating a child with an atypical bruising pattern.) Prolonged epistaxis may be due to thrombocytopenia or other coagulation abnormalities. Bert&#x2019;s decreased activity may be due to anemia or bone pain. His leg pain may be caused by leukemia or infection. A new-onset acute leukemia is high on the differential diagnosis list due to the subacute progression of symptoms and bone pain. This child&#x2019;s laboratory evaluation begins with a complete blood cell (CBC) count.</italic>
        </p>
        <p><italic>An automated CBC count reveals a white blood cell (WBC) count of 600/&#x3BC;L (0.6 &#xD7; 10</italic><sup><italic>9</italic></sup><italic>/L) with 100% lymphocytes, hemoglobin of 7.3 g/dL (73 g/L), and platelet count of 9 &#xD7; 10</italic><sup><italic>3</italic></sup><italic>/&#x3BC;L (9 &#xD7; 10</italic><sup><italic>9</italic></sup><italic>/L).</italic>

        <title>Leukemia</title>
        <p content-type="flushleft">Leukemias are the most common childhood malignancies, representing approximately 30% of cancer in children. Most of the pediatric leukemias are acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs), followed by acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs).</p>
        <sec>
          <title>Presentation.</title>
          <p content-type="flushleft">Signs and symptoms of acute childhood leukemia are often relatively mild and nonspecific; thus, it is easy to miss the diagnosis of new leukemia in a general pediatrics setting. Because progressive pancytopenia and bone pain due to proliferation of leukemic blasts in the bone marrow often evolve over weeks to months, it is not unusual to diagnose leukemia in a child who has a 2-month history of leg pain, minor bruising and bleeding, recurrent fevers, and malaise. Therefore, children who present with mild but recurrent &#x201C;leg and back pain&#x201D; deserve a careful examination in the office. Most importantly, these children should never be prescribed systemic corticosteroids before excluding the possibility of leukemia. Unsupervised exposure to systemic corticosteroids in patients who have new-onset leukemia may cause rapid death due to tumor lysis if appropriate inpatient supportive care is not provided or it may worsen the patient&#x2019;s long-term outcome if the leukemic blasts acquire resistance to corticosteroid-based chemotherapy. Therefore, children with &#x201C;bone pains&#x201D; and pancytopenia should be evaluated under the guidance of a pediatric hematologist-oncologist or a pediatric rheumatologist, depending on the overall clinical picture.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Diagnosis.</title>
          <p content-type="flushleft">At the initial evaluation, distinguishing acute leukemia from aplastic anemia may be difficult. Although some children with acute leukemia have a high WBC count with circulating blasts, a low or normal WBC value is not uncommon in new-onset leukemias. Furthermore, a substantial number of children with leukemia do not have peripherally circulating blasts. Even if present, peripheral leukemic blasts may not be recognized by automated cell counters. Therefore, a review of a peripheral blood smear by an experienced hematologist is essential.</p>
          <p>Some clinical signs and symptoms may be more consistent with leukemia or aplastic anemia, but a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy must be analyzed by a pediatric hematologist-oncologist to establish the correct diagnosis in a child with pancytopenia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>).</p>

          <p>The morphology of aplastic bone marrow is nonspecific. The appearance of bone marrow in other bone marrow diseases, including genetic bone marrow failure syndromes, may be identical. A high index of clinical suspicion is necessary to avoid a wrong diagnosis. Immune-mediated SAA is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is established once other causes of bone marrow aplasia, including inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, are ruled out.</p>
          <p>Patients with newly diagnosed bone marrow aplasia should be examined by a pediatric hematologist who has expertise in bone marrow failure syndromes. Diagnostic clues are often discovered through a careful physical examination and history taking. Persistent macrocytosis, reflecting stress hematopoiesis, is seen in multiple bone marrow failure syndromes in the absence of hemolysis. Small stature, facial dysmorphism, developmental delay, caf&#xE9;-au-lait macules, or foci of cutaneous hypopigmentation are seen in a wide range of congenital bone marrow failure syndromes, including Fanconi anemia (FA). Abnormal teeth and nails as well as oral leukoplakia raise concerns about dyskeratosis congenita. Chronic diarrhea may direct the diagnostic process toward Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. Recurrent fevers or altered mental status should be managed as neutropenic sepsis until proven otherwise, but they are concerning for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Thrombosis, dark urine, and recurrent abdominal pain suggest paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) as the cause of pancytopenia.</p>
          <p>A detailed family history interview may reveal family members with unexplained &#x201C;low blood counts,&#x201D; miscarriages or early childhood deaths, short stature, unusual infections, developmental abnormalities, or early-onset cancers in children or young adults who experienced unusual treatment toxicities. All the aforementioned issues are concerning for an undiagnosed congenital bone marrow failure syndrome associated with cancer predisposition or immunodeficiency. Family history of early-onset breast or pancreatic cancers may be concerning for FA due to disruption of the BRCA branch of the FA signaling network. Family history of pulmonary fibrosis raises suspicion of dyskeratosis congenita.</p>
          <p>The clinician must review all laboratory tests performed since the patient&#x2019;s birth. We commonly find evidence of mild pancytopenia and macrocytosis reported incidentally several months or years before the onset of clinical symptoms, which is concerning for an undiagnosed genetic problem.</p>
          <p>The laboratory evaluation of children who have newly diagnosed SAA varies among pediatric hospitals due to lack of evidence-based guidelines. We routinely administer a panel of screening tests to all children with newly diagnosed SAA to exclude common congenital bone marrow failure syndromes. A chromosome breakage test is performed to exclude FA. Flow cytometry should be used to exclude classic PNH. A review of bone marrow studies and chromosome tests can exclude myelodysplasia. Screening tests for Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and dyskeratosis congenita should be considered as well. A comprehensive infectious disease evaluation, including a search for evidence of viral hepatitis, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus, and human immunodeficiency virus, should be pursued. Red blood cell folate and serum vitamin B<sub>12</sub> as well as copper should be measured to exclude vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies as the cause of failed hematopoiesis. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing of the patient and siblings should be performed because matched-related stem cell transplant plays an essential role in the treatment of aplastic anemia.</p>

          <title>Treatment.</title>
          <p content-type="flushleft">Stem cell transplantation and immunosuppression are two excellent therapeutic options for children with immune-mediated SAA.</p>
          <p>Based on current research evidence from observational studies, a matched-related hematopoietic stem cell transplant is considered the best therapeutic option for children with SAA who have an HLA-matched family donor. With current conditioning regimens and meticulous supportive care, the expected 5-year survival is greater than 90%, but chronic graft-versus-host disease and second malignancies contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in survivors. Therefore, long-term follow-up evaluations with a bone marrow failure clinic are essential.</p>
          <p>Patients without a matched-related family donor undergo immunosuppression to stop the T-cell attack on the hematopoietic stem cells. In the United States, the first-line immunosuppressive strategy employs a combination of horse antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CSA). A brief course of corticosteroids is used to prevent ATG-induced serum sickness (corticosteroids alone have no role in the treatment of SAA). Approximately two out of three children who have SAA begin to recover their blood counts within 3 months of ATG therapy. These patients remain dependent on red blood cell and platelet transfusions while awaiting blood count recovery. Their risk of life-threatening opportunistic bacterial, viral, and fungal infections may increase even further during that time period due to therapy-induced immunosuppression on top of chronic neutropenia. Therefore, infection prophylaxis plays a vital role, and immediate attention to febrile neutropenia is necessary. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor may be used to boost neutrophil recovery.</p>
          <p>Patients who recover their bone marrow function after immunosuppressive therapy require close long-term follow-up evaluations at a bone marrow failure clinic. Hematopoietic progenitors in a subset of these patients undergo a clonal evolution, which may lead to myelodysplasia and leukemia. These patients are also at risk for PNH, solid tumors, and autoimmune disorders. CSA is tapered very slowly because rapid CSA weaning substantially increases the risk of relapse.</p>
          <p>Multi-institutional studies are needed to develop evidence-based guidelines for treatment of children who relapse or never recover bone marrow function after immunosuppression. Accumulating evidence suggests that children with SAA who do not recover counts within 3 months after immunosuppression should be offered an unrelated-matched donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation if a matched donor is available. Alternative therapeutic strategies are available if transplant is not an option, but they have not been systematically evaluated in clinical trials in the pediatric population. Eltrombopag, a small-molecule thrombopoietin receptor activator, improved hematopoiesis in a significant number of adults with refractory SAA in recent clinical trials. (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) The safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in refractory pediatric aplastic anemia remains to be studied in clinical trials.</p>

          <p>PNH is an acquired bone marrow disorder that leads to pancytopenia and thrombosis due to complement-mediated breakdown of blood cells. (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) PNH develops when a hematopoietic stem cell undergoes a somatic mutation in PIG-A, an enzyme essential for the attachment of multiple proteins to the cell membrane through a glycosyl phosphatidylinositide anchor. As a consequence, all blood cells produced by the PIG-A mutant cell do not display the surface signature of GPI-anchored proteins. These proteins include CD55 and CD59, two antigens that protect blood cells from complement-mediated destruction. In PNH, the absence of these proteins on blood cell membranes renders cells susceptible to complement lysis.</p>
          <p>Destruction of blood cells causes pancytopenia. Children who have PNH experience recurrent abdominal pain, headaches, and malaise out of proportion to their anemia. Hemoglobinuria, the eponymous sign of PNH, is caused by intravascular breakdown of red blood cells and release of hemoglobin into the bloodstream. Hemoglobinuria in PNH is notable on the first morning void, but it may persist throughout the day; in some patients, hemoglobinuria leads to acute or chronic kidney injury.</p>
          <p>PNH-associated thrombosis often leads to life-threatening complications such as arterial or venous thrombosis of the central nervous system. The pathophysiology of thrombosis in PNH is not clear, but the intravascular hemolysis appears to play a crucial role because therapeutic inhibition of complement reduces the risk of thrombosis to normal levels.</p>

          <title>Diagnosis.</title>
          <p content-type="flushleft">PNH is diagnosed by flow cytometry tests that detect the CD55/CD59 antigens on the surfaces of blood cells. The size of the &#x201C;PNH clone&#x201D; is quantified by measuring the fraction of PNH granulocytes (the PNH red blood cells undergo rapid complement lysis in the bloodstream). The blood of a PNH patient contains a mixture of normal blood cells produced by healthy bone marrow cells and the CD55/CD59-negatve &#x201C;PNH clone&#x201D; representing the offspring of the PIG-A-deficient hematopoietic stem cell. The size of the PNH clone has diagnostic and therapeutic implications. In classic PNH, more than 50% of blood cells represent the PNH clone. Bone marrow evaluation may not be needed if the diagnosis of classic PNH is established via flow cytometry. Most patients with PNH have normocellular bone marrow, but PNH may evolve into aplastic anemia.</p>
          <p>Interestingly, many patients with aplastic anemia have a small but detectable PNH clone. According to observational studies, these patients should not be diagnosed with PNH and do not require PNH therapy as long as the size of their PNH clone is less than 50% (usually is much lower) and there are no clinical or laboratory signs or symptoms of PNH. The intriguing relationship between PNH and aplastic anemia is incompletely understood and will be addressed in future studies.</p>

          <title>Treatment.</title>
          <p content-type="flushleft">Medical management of PNH has been revolutionized by eculizumab, the monoclonal antibody against the C5 component of the complement cascade. Clinical trials in adult populations showed that eculizumab rapidly inhibits hemolysis in PNH, improves blood counts, and alleviates clinical symptoms. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) Importantly, eculizumab appears to reverse the risk of thrombosis back to baseline level. However, most patients treated with eculizumab continue to experience mild ongoing hemolysis. This is likely due to alternative complement activation pathways as well as genetic polymorphisms in the complement pathway. Efforts to develop drugs against the alternative pathway are ongoing, and clinical trials are expected soon.</p>
          <p>Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only cure for PNH. Limited data indicate that a hematopoietic stem cell transplant is a feasible option for selected children and young adults without history of significant comorbidities such as major thrombosis.</p>

          <p>FA is a rare, genetically complex multiorgan disorder caused by mutations in one of at least 18 genes of the FA signaling network.</p>
          <p>The prevalence of FA is estimated at 1 in 100,000 individuals. Progressive bone marrow failure is the most consistent clinical hallmark. The clinical presentation is exceptionally heterogenous; disruption of the FA pathway may cause abnormal development of all organs.

Some patients who have multiple congenital anomalies are recognized soon after birth. However, at least one in three patients does not have any visible developmental anomalies. They may not come to medical attention until their school years, when they develop clinically significant pancytopenia due to bone marrow failure. Several patients with unusual or treatment-resistant cancers have been diagnosed with FA as adults, indicating that the prevalence of FA is likely underestimated.</p>

          <p content-type="flushleft">A chromosome breakage test is a sensitive and specific diagnostic tool to screen for FA. It is one of the most useful tests in the diagnostic armamentarium of a pediatric hematologist-oncologist. This test is based on the fact that a low concentration of DNA-crosslinking chemical such as DEB (diepoxybutane) or MMC (mitomycin C) causes chromosome breakage in FA patient cells but not in normal cells.</p>
          <p>A positive chromosome breakage test establishes a diagnosis of FA. This is followed by a genetic evaluation to identify the affected gene. A rational approach to genetic diagnostics of FA is essential, given the large number of FA genes. A next-generation parallel sequencing of all FA genes may be pursued. In some patients, multiple variants of unknown significance are identified in several FA genes, and functional complementation studies are required to identify the disease-causing mutation. Alternatively, candidate gene sequencing may be performed first if the patient&#x2019;s presentation offers sufficient clues to predict what gene may be affected. The genotype-phenotype correlations in FA are only beginning to emerge, but such prediction can be made for selected patients. For example, a child with new-onset FA and a strong family history of early-onset breast cancer may have a biallelic mutation in <italic>BRCA2/FANCD1</italic> or one of its binding partners.</p>
          <p>Comprehensive guidelines for diagnosis and management of FA are provided by a panel of experts at the Fanconi Anemia Research Fund. Children with newly diagnosed FA should undergo a comprehensive evaluation to screen for clinically silent developmental abnormalities. Creatinine and electrolytes are assessed to screen for kidney dysfunction. Ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen and pelvis is performed to detect renal dysplasia, hydronephrosis, and other functionally important structural aberrations of the urogenital system. The child who has a history of recurrent urinary tract infection should be referred to urology for further studies, such as voiding cystourethrography to determine whether vesicoureteral reflux is present. A formal referral to an endocrinologist is warranted to screen for hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, dyslipidemia, osteopenia, and hyperglycemia. An audiology evaluation is performed to screen for hearing loss. Other tests are guided by the patient&#x2019;s past medical history.</p>

          <title>Treatment.</title>
          <p content-type="flushleft">Supportive care is personalized, based on the results of the baseline evaluation. Most patients experience progressive bone marrow failure over time, but there is substantial variation among patients. Thus, CBC counts are monitored on a scheduled basis to follow the trajectory of pancytopenia. Bone marrow aspirates/biopsies and cytogenetic studies are obtained annually or as clinically needed due to the high risk of myelodysplasia and AML. Multiple observational studies show that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be lifesaving for FA patients who develop transfusion-dependent pancytopenia or AML. FA-specific stem cell transplantation protocols must be used because patients are hypersensitive to chemotherapeutics and chemotherapy doses must be minimized to prevent life-threatening complications. Because cancers in FA are extremely difficult to treat, an aggressive surveillance strategy is instituted.</p>

<italic>A chromosome breakage test yields positive results, confirming the clinical suspicion of FA and indicating that Donna&#x2019;s short stature and frequent infections were due to FA.

          <p>Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (also known as Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome [SBDS]) is a genetic disorder associated with pancytopenia, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, skeletal malformations, and developmental delay. The incidence of this syndrome is estimated at 1 in 76,000 individuals. Patients often come to medical attention due to chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive. Most require supplementation with pancreatic enzymes due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The endocrine pancreatic function is normal.</p>
          <p>Progressive bone marrow failure often starts in early childhood. Skeletal malformations range from clinically insignificant abnormalities of long bone metaphyses to potentially lethal thoracic abnormalities leading to respiratory failure. Delayed ossification and osteopenia are universal. Although many have SBDS diagnosed in the first postnatal year, the syndrome may be diagnosed in older children because clinical signs and symptoms, as with other inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, are highly heterogenous.</p>

          <title>Diagnosis.</title>
          <p content-type="flushleft">Approximately 90% patients clinically diagnosed with SBDS have autosomal recessive mutations in the <italic>SBDS</italic> gene. The <italic>SBDS</italic> gene localizes to the nucleolus and the mitotic spindle in a cell cycle-dependent manner to regulate ribosome assembly in interphase and chromosome segregation during mitosis.</p>
          <p>The evaluation of pancytopenia begins with a bone marrow examination to exclude leukemia. Chronic pancytopenia in combination with hypocellular bone marrow, history of chronic diarrhea, and skeletal abnormalities should direct the diagnostic process toward SBDS. However, the absence of these physical findings does not exclude the syndrome; some affected patients have subclinical pancreatic insufficiency and no skeletal abnormalities. Quantification of age-appropriate pancreatic enzyme concentrations in serum assists with the diagnosis. Low serum trypsinogen values are seen in affected children younger than age 3 years, but low serum isoamylase values are more sensitive in older children. <italic>SBDS</italic> gene sequencing confirms the diagnosis and allows genetic counseling for most patients. A skeletal survey helps detect bone abnormalities. Pancreatic imaging reveals replacement of exocrine pancreas with fatty tissue.</p>

          <title>Treatment.</title>
          <p content-type="flushleft">Expert guidelines for diagnosis and management of SBDS have been published. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) The complex medical needs of affected children should be coordinated by an expert hematologist-oncologist. Blood counts should be followed regularly because these children may progress into severe transfusion-dependent bone marrow failure. A significant number of patients require a stem cell transplant to restore normal hematopoiesis. Because the risk of myelodysplasia and AML is significantly higher compared to the general population, a bone marrow evaluation, including karyotype and MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome) genetic fluorescence in situ hybridization screening panel, is performed yearly. Pancreatic enzyme supplementation is managed by a pediatric gastroenterology specialist with expertise in management of SBDA.</p>
          <p><bold><italic>Case 5 continued</italic></bold><italic>: A bone marrow evaluation reveals a hypocellular bone marrow with no blasts. Results of a chromosome breakage test are negative, excluding FA. Laboratory tests show extremely low serum trypsinogen values consistent with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, which explains Christopher&#x2019;s diarrhea. He is referred to gastroenterology to initiate pancreatic enzyme supplementation. Skeletal survey does not reveal any bone abnormalities other than delayed ossification of carpal bones, widened distal ulnae and radii, and generalized osteopenia. A Shwachman-Diamond gene sequencing reveals biallelic mutations in the</italic> SBDS <italic>gene that had been described as disease-associated. Genetic counseling is provided to the family. A multidisciplinary management plan is developed with collaboration among pediatric hematology, clinical genetics, pediatric gastroenterology, and an endocrinologist.</italic></p>

                <p>On the basis of consensus, primary clinicians play a key role in identifying children who have pancytopenia. A high index of suspicion is indispensable because signs and symptoms of low blood cell counts are often nonspecific.
