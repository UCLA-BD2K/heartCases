    <p><bold>Clinical data:</bold> non-progressive shortness of breath on moderate exertion for 1
year. A heart murmur had been heard at one month of age, and the patient had been followed
up irregularly ever since. She did not report cyanosis and had recently been prescribed
with hydrochlorothiazide. Laboratory tests showed H = 4,700,000/mm<sup>3</sup>; Hct = 41%;
Hg = 13.4 g/dL.</p>
    <p><bold>Physical examination:</bold> normal breathing, acyanotic, normal pulses. Weight: 62
kg; height: 163 cm; blood pressure: 110/60 mmHg; heart rate: 78 bpm; oxygen saturation:
97%; aorta not palpable on the suprasternal notch.</p>
    <p>The apical impulse was not palpable in the precordium, and there were no systolic impulses
on the left sternal border. Normal heart sounds; grade 3/4 course systolic murmur on the
mid-left sternal border accompanied by thrill. The liver was not palpable.</p>
    <sec>
      <title>Laboratory tests</title>
      <p><bold>Electrocardiogram</bold> showed normal sinus rhythm and signs of right ventricular
(RV) overload. Low-voltage QRS complex with qR morphology in V1, RS in V6 with final
conduction disturbance through the right bundle branch. QRSA: -70&#xBA;, TA: + 30&#xBA;.</p>
      <p><bold>Chest radiograph</bold> showed normal cardiac silhouette (cardiothoracic ratio of
0.46). The pulmonary vascular network was normal and the arch of the pulmonary artery
was concave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

      <p><bold>Echocardiogram</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>) showed
right ventricular inflow tract stenosis causing an intraventricular gradient of 80 mmHg,
with a 13-mm diameter ventricular septal defect partially occluded by the tricuspid
valve, thus resulting in an effective 4.7&#x2011;mm orifice. There was RV hypertrophy with
mildly enlarged right cardiac chambers. Gradient between ventricles was 82 mmHg. There
was a small aneurysm formation in the ventricular septum. Measurements were as follows:
left ventricle (LV) = 45 mm; left atrium (LA) = 32; Ao = 26; septum = posterior wall = 7
mm. LV ejection fraction = 66%. There was a 3-mm foramen ovale with bidirectional
predominantly left&#x2011;to&#x2011;right shunt. RV systolic pressure = 110 mmHg.</p>

Pressure values were: RV inflow tract = 98/13; RV outflow tract = 25/7; PT = 20/7-12; LV
= 124/11; Ao = 126/64; PC = 11 mmHg.</p>
      <p><bold>Clinical diagnosis:</bold> Severe RV inflow tract stenosis with perimembranous
ventricular septal defect of little impact, with no hypoxemia and/or heart failure, in
natural course.</p>
      <p><bold>Clinical reasoning:</bold> The clinical elements of long-standing right
obstructive congenital heart defects without hypoxemia present as shortness of breath
and are not accompanied by hematocrit elevation. For this reason, with preserved cardiac
output, their outcome is favorable thanks to compensatory myocardial hypertrophy. The
normal heart sounds suggest normal arterial position, and the preserved pulmonary flow
results from an adequate compensatory mechanism. The severe systolic murmur in the
mid-left sternal border suggests the presence of an obstructive lesion in the RV inflow
tract and differentiates from the murmur of the ventricular septal defect for being
coarser and stronger. Ventricular septal defects of little impact do not result in any
functional disturbance, and their auscultatory manifestation mingles with that of the
obstructive defect. RV systolic overload on the electrocardiogram suggests the diagnosis
of an obstructive lesion on the right. Chest radiograph showing normal cardiac
silhouette is consistent with good RV function, and the normal pulmonary vascular
network results from the maintained antegrade flow.</p>
      <p><bold>Differential diagnosis:</bold> Heart diseases with RV outflow tract obstruction
may have a similar presentation, except for the systolic murmur, which is more intense
in the upper left sternal border, irradiating to the neck vessels, albeit mildly.</p>
      <p><bold>Management:</bold> Because of the long-standing systolic impact with severe
hypertrophy and nearly systemic RV pressures, indication of operation becomes mandatory,
aiming at relieving the chamber obstruction, which would imply a greater possibility of
development of myocardial fibrosis, heart failure, arrhythmias and earlier death.</p>
      <p><bold>Commentaries:</bold> Obstructive congenital heart defects usually manifest early
in life by means of a heart murmur. Cardiac compensation with maintained antegrade flow
is achieved by myocardial hypertrophy. The consequences of this phenomenon are directly
proportional to the degree of obstruction. In the present case, this obstruction, which
was more intense in adulthood and whose manifestation of symptoms had been more recent,
progressed throughout time, which permitted a good outcome during this period. Hence,
the patient had a favorable course up to the fourth decade of life. Most of these
patients are treated in childhood and very uncommonly in adulthood. These defects result
from an impaired growth of the trabecular myocardium during the early fetal formation,
and the non-uniformity in its position, closer to the tricuspid or pulmonary valve,
which causes the ventricle to divide into two parts &#x2013; a proximal and a distal part. They
are frequently associated with ventricular septal defects (80% of cases)<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Even when their impact is minor, these obstructive anomalies should be
treated earlier to prevent an unfavorable outcome in relation to the development of
myocardial fibrosis, arrhythmias and heart failure.</p>
