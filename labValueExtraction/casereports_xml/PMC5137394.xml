    <p>A 56-year-old man was admitted for a diagnostic evaluation of recent onset of chest
pain.</p>
    <p>Three days before admission, he had woken up in the middle of the night with a tight
precordial pain of strong intensity, lasting for 20 minutes, radiating to the upper left
limb and accompanied by dyspnea, which led him to seek medical attention. The myocardial
injury markers were not increased, and the ECG was not considered suggestive of acute
myocardial ischemia. After receiving a prescription of atenolol and aspirin, the patient
was instructed to seek the Cardiology Department for outpatient care. In the days
following the initial clinical presentation, he had two new episodes with lower
intensity and sought medical assistance at this Hospital.</p>
    <p>He also complained of dyspnea on exertion, which progressed over many years and had not
intensified in the period. He was a smoker of 40 cigarettes per day and had known
hypertension, which was controlled without medication.</p>
    <p>On physical examination (on March 25, 2009), the patient was in good general condition,
ruddy, hydrated, eupneic, with a regular heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 132 x
78 mmHg and normal pulmonary and heart auscultation. There were no changes upon
examination of the abdomen. Peripheral pulses were normal, and there was no edema or
signs of deep vein thrombosis.</p>
    <p>The ECG at rest (on March 25, 2009) showed a sinus rhythm, a heart rate of 82 bpm, a PR
interval of 160 ms, QRS duration of 110 ms, QT of 360 ms, left atrial enlargement, an ST
segment flat in leads II, III and aVF and also elevated from V<sub>1</sub> to
V<sub>3</sub> (increased convexity in V<sub>1</sub> and increased concavity in
V<sub>2</sub> and V<sub>3</sub>), and positive and symmetrical T waves in leads
V<sub>5</sub> and V<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
    <p>
<fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>ECG (on March 25, 2009): sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement,
intraventricular conduction disturbance of the stimulus (dQRS = 110 ms),
left ventricular enlargement, ventricular repolarization abnormalities (ST
segment with a slight elevation from V<sub>1</sub> to V<sub>3</sub> and flat
in the inferior leads), and symmetrical T waves in V<sub>5</sub> and
V<sub>6</sub>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="abc-107-05-0485-gf01"/></fig>
</p>
    <p>A stress test performed on the same day revealed during rest a heart rate of 83 bpm and
blood pressure of 140 x 90 mmHg. The maximum heart rate achieved with 3 minutes of
exercise was 127 bpm and the blood pressure measured at that moment was 140 x 90 mmHg.
The test was interrupted due to physical fatigue, and at 4 minutes and 21 seconds, his
heart rate returned to 87 bpm and blood pressure to 140 x 80 mmHg.</p>
    <p>The ECG at peak exercise revealed a horizontal segment depression of 2 mm in
V<sub>5</sub> and of 1 mm in V<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure
2</xref>), and the ECG during recovery showed an increase in the segment depression,
which became descendant in the same leads and in the II, III and aVF leads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

</p>
    <p>The test was considered positive for myocardial ischemia, and the patient was admitted
for coronary cineangiography.</p>
    <p>The laboratory tests (on March 25, 2009) revealed a hemoglobin of 15 g/dL, hematocrit
44%, leukocytes 8,000/mm&#xB3; (with normal differential count), platelets 142,000/mm&#xB3;,
glucose 109 mg/dL, urea 25 mg/dL, creatinine 0.72 mg/dL, total cholesterol 184 mg/dL,
HDL-cholesterol 57 mg/dL, LDL-cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglycerides 54 mg/dL, sodium 136
mEq/L, potassium 4.1 mEq/L, thrombin time (INR) 1.2, activated partial thromboplastin
time (rel) 1.08, CK-MB 2.12 ng/mL, and troponin &lt; 0.2 ng/mL.</p>
    <p>The patient received a daily prescription of aspirin 200 mg, propranolol 120 mg,
captopril 37.5 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, and enoxaparin 60 mg.</p>
    <p>Coronary cineangiography (on March 26, 2009) revealed a left main coronary artery free of
obstructions, anterior interventricular branch with an 80% obstructive lesion in the
middle third, first diagonal with a 90% lesion in the ostium, and second diagonal with a
70% lesion in the ostium. There were multiple lesions in the circumflex branch, the
largest with 90% in the middle third, the first and second left marginal branches with a
90% lesion, the third left marginal with a 60% lesion, and two posterior ventricular
branches of the circumflex with irregularities. The right coronary artery was occluded
and received grade 3 collaterals from the left coronary artery branches. The left
ventricle was dilated, with accentuated diffuse hypokinesia and an apical dyskinetic
area, with a filling failure suggestive of an apical thrombus.</p>
    <p>Coronary artery bypass graft surgery was indicated.</p>
    <p>About 6 hours after the coronary cineangiography, the patient developed dyspnea with
bronchospasm and fenoterol 2 mg and ipratropium bromide 0.5 mg were administered by
inhalation and hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenously. Propranolol and captopril were
suspended.</p>
    <p>Plasma level of CK-MB was 2.91 ng/mL.</p>
    <p>A few hours later (at 1:45 a.m. on March 27, 2009), the patient presented cardiac arrest
in asystole, for which external cardiac massage was started, three doses of 1 mg
epinephrine and three doses of 0.5 mg atropine were administered, and endotracheal
intubation was performed. The patient progressed with pulseless electrical activity,
followed by ventricular fibrillation reverted with a 360-J shock. ECG tracing in a
single lead revealed an extreme ST segment elevation (greater than 10 mm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>) and, soon after, pulseless electrical
activity with extreme bradycardia (25 bpm), irreversible asystole and death (at 2:30
a.m. on March 27, 2009).</p>

      <title>Clinical aspects</title>
      <p>This is a 56-year-old man with a recent onset of angina and three-vessel lesions on
coronary cineangiography, who presented with dyspnea and, a few hours later,
cardiorespiratory arrest with intense ST segment elevation.</p>
      <p>Angina is the initial manifestation in half of the patients with coronary artery
disease. Even when stable, <italic>i.e.</italic>, without changes in the triggering
events or intensity, a duration of the episodes longer than 3 months doubles the
risk of cardiovascular events.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
</p>
      <p>Unstable angina is defined by the presence of at least one of the following findings:
occurring at rest or upon exertion, lasting more than 20 minutes, or having a
progressive pattern (more intense, prolonged, or frequent).<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>
</p>
      <p>Thus, the anginal pattern presented by the patient was that of unstable angina, which
implies a 6% risk of death and of requirement of revascularization in the first
year.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>
</p>
      <p>The occurrence of unstable angina, such as that of the patient, is greater in men
than in women and increases with age, reaching its peak frequency at the age of 70
years and decreasing in the following decades.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
</p>
      <p>According to unstable angina risk classifications, the patient would be classified
with TIMI 2 and GRACE 86 scores, which predict risks of death at 30 days of 5.4% and
4%, respectively.</p>
      <p>The risk of the patient was been stratified with the stress test, which proved
positive with a frequency of 156 bpm but showed an increased segment depression
during recovery, which increased his odds of being a multivessel patient or carrier
of a left main coronary artery lesion. This was confirmed by coronary
cineangiography, which revealed critical lesions in the anterior, diagonal,
circumflex, and marginal interventricular arteries, as well as occlusion of the
right coronary artery.</p>
      <p>Autopsy studies show that 75% of the fatal infarctions have plaque rupture, while the
remaining 25% have endothelial erosion.<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>
</p>
      <p><italic>In vivo</italic> studies using optical coherence tomography have shown a
similar or slightly increased number attributed to erosion in patients with unstable
angina (from 22% to 31%).<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>
</p>
      <p>More recently, the erosion of the atherosclerotic plaque has been more associated
with thrombosis in infarctions either with or without segment elevation, which led
to the questioning of the vulnerable plaque concept (plaques with a thin fibrous cap
with less than 65 micra, and rich lipid core.)<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p>
      <p>As for the final event, cardiorespiratory arrest with ECG during recovery showing QRS
with monophasic R wave, large segment elevation with J point elevation, and positive
T wave (the so-called complex M in acute myocardial infarction) has been associated
with the presence of left ventricular free wall rupture, but without much
specificity.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>
</p>
      <p>It is known that the occurrence of hypotension and bradycardia followed by pulseless
electrical activity are typical signs of bleeding to the pericardial sac;
additionally, pulseless electrical activity in the absence of previous heart failure
in a patient in a first heart attack has a predictive accuracy of 97.6% for the
diagnosis of left ventricular free wall rupture.<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> (<bold>Dr. Desiderio Favarato</bold>)</p>
      <p><bold>Diagnostic hypothesis:</bold> ischemic heart disease unstable angina followed
by acute myocardial infarction with likely left ventricular free wall rupture.

      <title>Necropsy</title>
      <p>The necropsy evidenced systemic atherosclerosis as the main disease, with severe
involvement of the aorta and coronary arteries, with an obstruction greater than 80%
in the three main branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). In the
right coronary artery, there was a thrombus undergoing organization in the distal
bed, and a recent, occlusive thrombosis with plaque rupture at the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th
centimeters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>). Due to these
thromboses, in the posterior wall (inferior, diaphragmatic) of the left ventricle,
there were a small infarction in the final stage of organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>) and morphologically dubious areas of
myocardial infarction with a few hours of onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>); the latter change was also present in the lateral wall of the
left ventricle, in the subendocardial region of the remaining walls of this chamber,
and in the right ventricle. As a possible consequence of a recent infarction, there
was acute pulmonary edema.</p>

      <title>Comments</title>
      <p>This patient had severe triple-vessel coronary atherosclerotic obstructions. In the
past, he had thrombosis of the right distal coronary artery bed, with infarction in
its territory of irrigation. Subsequently, he had new thrombosis in this artery, at
a more proximal level, which possibly determined the myocardial infarction, thus
causing the patient's death. It should be emphasized, however, that the
morphological aspect was highly suggestive (but not indisputable) of a recent
infarction. For this reason, the precise extent of the ischemic injury could not be
determined. The presence of acute pulmonary edema strengthens the possibility of the
occurrence of the recent infarction. (<bold>Dr. Paulo Sampaio Gutierrez</bold>)</p>
