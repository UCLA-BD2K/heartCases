        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>A dog developed a cervical mass, and computed tomography verified a mass
surrounding the trachea with some pulmonary masses. Histopathologically, the cervical mass
was composed of malignant neoplastic cells showing follicular appearance which reacted
positive for thyroglobulin on immunohistochemistry. A characteristic feature of the tumor
was abundant and metaplastic stromal components. Anastomosed collagenous tissues
connecting to capsule of the tumor were abundant in the stroma. In parts of the
collagenous tissues, mature cartilages and bones were continuously formed. There was no
cellular atypia or invasion in the components. We diagnosed this case as follicular
thyroid carcinoma with metaplastic stroma. This is the first case report that
characterizes stromal components with chondroid and osseous metaplasia in a canine thyroid
carcinoma.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Thyroid carcinomas (follicular cell carcinomas) are diagnosed more frequently than adenomas
in dogs and are classified into well-differentiated, poorly-differentiated and
undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].
Well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas are subdivided into follicular, compact,
follicular-compact and papillary thyroid carcinomas on the basis of predominant histologic
pattern, and the neoplastic cells form multinodular nests including hemorrhage and necrosis.
It has been described that some canine thyroid carcinomas form bone in the stroma [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, stromal chondroid and osseous metaplasia
have also been reported [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, there was limited
information concerning the stromal components in the literatures. This is the first case
report that characterizes abundant stromal components with chondroid and osseous metaplasia in
a canine follicular thyroid carcinoma.</p>
    <p>A 12-year-old, spayed female, mixed-breed dog with a cervical mass was taken to an animal
hospital. Computed tomography revealed the mass surrounding the trachea with patchy regions of
high density which was comparable to bone tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.
1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Computed tomography image of the neck. The mass surrounding the trachea (arrowheads) is
observed. There are patchy regions of high density (arrow) which is comparable to that

cervical mass was resected by surgery and then fixed in 10% neutral formalin. Macroscopically,
the mass was approximately 8 &#xD7; 7 &#xD7; 3 cm, solid and relatively well-demarcated and irregular in
shape. The cut surface was creamy-white and had partial sandy texture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Cut surface of the cervical mass. The color is creamy-white, and white areas that have
a sandy texture are scattered within the mass.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1161-g002"/></fig>). After surgery, the dog developed a cough, and decreasing thyroxine and increasing
total cholesterol in the serum were elucidated. Serum thyroxine was controlled with a thyroid
hormonal agent, and myxedema was not observed. The dog died of respiratory failure eight
months after surgery, and necropsy was not done.</p>
    <p>Samples from the formalin-fixed mass were embedded in paraffin, cut at 4 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>m
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE), alcian blue and the Watanabe&#x2019;s method for
reticulin fibers. Calcified solid samples were decalcified with 10% formic acid for several
days before embedding. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using the immunoenzyme
polymer method. The 4 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>m sections were pretreated with citrate buffer (pH
6.0) in a microwave for 15 min at 95&#xB0;C (for all antibodies except cytokeratin) or Proteinase K
Ready-to-use (for cytokeratin; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 3 min at room temperature. After
the sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide, blocking solution (Dako) was applied and
incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The following primary antibodies were reacted at 4&#xB0;C
overnight; polyclonal rabbit anti-thyroglobulin (Dako; pre-diluted), polyclonal rabbit
anti-calcitonin (Dako; 1:100), monoclonal mouse anti-synaptophysin (clone SY 38; PROGEN,
Heidelberg, Germany; 1:50), polyclonal rabbit anti-cytokeratin wide spectrum screening (Dako;
1:100), monoclonal mouse anti-vimentin (clone V9; Dako; 1:100), monoclonal mouse anti-smooth
muscle actin (&#x3B1;-SMA; clone 1A4; Dako; 1:200) and monoclonal mouse anti-proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA; clone PC10; Dako; 1:200). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse/rabbit IgG
(Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan) was used as the secondary antibody for 30-min incubation at room
temperature. The sections were color developed with DAB solution (Nichirei) and counterstained
with hematoxylin. As the positive control, normal canine thyroid tissue was used.</p>
    <p>Histopathologically, the cervical mass was encapsulated by connective tissue and divided into
a large number of neoplastic nests, and no native thyroid tissues were observed in any
sections. Focal necrosis, cholesterin clefts and lymphoplasmacytic infiltration were
scattered. Two histologic patterns of the neoplastic cells were observed in the tumor. The
first pattern showed follicular appearances, being absolutely predominant in the tumor. The
neoplastic cells were cuboidal with round to oval and vesicular nuclei and amphophilic to
eosinophilic cytoplasms, and these cells formed a number of miniature follicles, or cribriform
or solid nests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Neoplastic follicular cells form cribriform nests. HE. (Inset) The neoplastic cells are
positive for thyroglobulin.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1161-g003"/></fig>). Mitotic figures were frequently seen (28 per 10 high-powered fields). The second
pattern showed compact sheets resembling C cells. The neoplastic cells had small round nuclei
and clear cytoplasm with obscure cell borders and formed small and solid nests or trabecular
structures. By immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells in both areas were strongly positive
for thyroglobulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref>) and cytokeratin, while
negative for calcitonin or synaptophysin. Moreover, a large number of the cells were positive
for PCNA (55 positive cells per 100 tumor cells; 55%). These findings indicated that
malignancy of the tumor and the neoplastic cells originated from thyroid follicular cells.</p>
    <p>On the other hands, abundant mesenchymal tissues formed in the tumor stroma. In the stroma,
collagenous tissues connecting capsule of the tumor formed anastomosed branch of collagen
bundles across the neoplastic tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_004" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Anastomosing collagen bundles connecting to capsule of the tumor (Cap) are developed.
The cartilages (C) are continuously formed from the fibrous tissue. HE.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1161-g004"/></fig><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_005" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>Multifocal cartilages (C) and bones (B) are formed in the tumor stroma. HE.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1161-g005"/></fig>). Additionally, multifocal cartilage and bone were continuously formed from the
collagenous tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Figs. 4</xref> and<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_005"> 5</xref>). The collagenous component was composed of mature collagen fibers
and interlaced with spindle cells with uniform elongate or oval nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_006">Fig. 6</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_006" position="float"><label>Fig. 6.</label><caption><p>The spindle cells interlacing with collagen bundles are present in the stromal fibrous
area. These cells don&#x2019;t show atypia and mitotic figures. HE.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1161-g006"/></fig>). Immunohistochemically, the spindle cells were positive for vimentin and negative for
cytokaratin or thyroglobulin. A small portion of the cells positively stained with &#x3B1;-SMA or
PCNA (16 positive cells per 100 spindle cells; 16%). In the chondral component, monomorphic
chondrocytes that had single and crumpled nuclei in hyalinized cartilages were observed. The
cartilage matrices were stained with pale to deep blue for alcian blue staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_007">Fig. 7</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_007" position="float"><label>Fig. 7.</label><caption><p>The chondral components are composed of well-differentiated chondrocytes in mature
cartilage matrices which are stained with pale to deep blue. Alcian blue staining.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1161-g007"/></fig>) and were partially calcified. From the edge of the calcified cartilages, the osseous
components were formed, suggesting endochondral ossification. These osseous tissues were
composed of lamellar bone matrix containing osteocytes within the lacunae and were partly
fringed with osteoblasts which had pyknotic nucleus and flattened cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_008">Fig. 8</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_008" position="float"><label>Fig. 8.</label><caption><p>The osseous components are composed of mature bone matrix with osteocytes which are
partly fringed with osteoblasts (arrows) and osteoclasts (arrowhead). HE.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1161-g008"/></fig>). Some multinucleated osteoclasts were contacted with the border of the bone. No
mitotic figure or atypia was observed in the fibroblasts, chondrocytes and osteoblasts at any
sites. The cartilage and bone were thoroughly surrounded by neoplastic parenchyma, and there
was no independent proliferation of the chondral or osseous component without fibrous tissue.
In the cartilage and bone, necrosis of adjacent tissue associated with invasion was not
observed. The stromal components were clearly separated from neoplastic parenchyma by basement
membranes highlighted in Watanabe&#x2019;s method for reticulin fibers. The amount of stroma varied
remarkably depending on the neoplastic area examined.</p>
    <p>We diagnosed the case as follicular thyroid carcinoma with abundant stromal components based
on the view that the stromal components underwent alteration that was not neoplastic, but
metaplastic. The tumor was characterized by mixed features of follicular neoplastic cells and
abundant mesenchymal components with osseous and chondroid metaplasia in the stroma. It has
been reported bone or cartilage formation in the stroma of canine follicular carcinoma [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; however,
details of the stromal components were not described particularly.</p>
    <p>As differential diagnosis, thyroid carcinosarcoma (canine malignant mixed tumor of thyroid)
which is characterized by malignant follicular and malignant mesenchymal components was
included. In fact, at first, we suspected the thyroid carcinosarcoma due to superficial
proliferation of the mesenchymal components in the present case. In published reports,
sarcomatous components in carcinosarcoma showed various differentiation including fibrous,
chondral, osseous and sometime vascular components [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The origin or
clonality of the components remained unclear [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In
these reports, malignancy of the sarcomatous components was demonstrated based on cellular
atypia and high mitotic index of the mesenchymal cells. Clinically, each carcinomatous and
sarcomatous component could metastasize to other organs, such as the lungs [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It was considered that the mesenchymal components in our
case would not show neoplastic, but hyperplastic and metaplastic alteration. The fibroblasts,
chondrocytes and osteoblasts never show atypia and mitosis and accompanying mature cartilage
and bone. These components showed heterogeneous and multifocal extension in the tumor stroma
without invasion to the surrounding tissues. There was no independent proliferation of the
components.</p>
    <p>Careful microscopic examination of cellular atypia, localization and invasion in the
mesenchymal components to diagnose thyroid carcinoma with abundant stroma in dogs is
important. In abundant stroma, it is likely that the proliferative and metaplastic mesenchymal
components seem to be sarcomatous in some cases. Prognosis and therapeutic responses might be
different between thyroid carcinoma and carcinosarcoma, although clinical information of
carcinosarcoma is still poor because the tumor is very rare in dogs.</p>
