      <abstract>
        <p>Six patients, all with evidence of metastatic or locally recurrent tumours, were selected for inclusion in a trial study of simultaneous hyperthermia and ionizing radiation therapy. Heat was applied by hot air, or microwaves, or a combination of both. When examined after treatment, 3 patients were found to be free of the lesions treated. One patient had a partial response, followed by regression of the tumour; one patient died with metastases in the lungs and one patient responded to the treatment but died from a massive pulmonary embolus. The simultaneous application of hyperthermia and ionizing radiation therapy was well tolerated. It induced disappearance of tumours in cases where conventional methods had failed, and with far greater efficiency than conventional therapeutic methods.</p>
