        <p>Intramuscular sparganosis is not common, and its rarity makes it difficult to be distinguished from soft tissue tumors. A case of rare intramuscular sparganosis is reported. A 44-year-old man presented with a painful mass in the left thigh for 8 months, which was initially diagnosed a as soft tissue tumor. Ultrasonography and MRI revealed a multilobulated mass in the sartorius muscle. After the needle biopsy under the guidance of ultrasonography, sparganum was discovered under microscopic examination of the excised tissue. Surgical excision was performed, and a live larva of sparganum was removed. Sparganosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of soft tissue tumors, especially among Koreans who have frequently ingested mountain water and consumed raw snakes or frogs.</p>
