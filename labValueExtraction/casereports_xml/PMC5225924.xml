      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS - OMIM 303600) is a rare cause of intellectual disability
that is associated with genetic inheritance linked to the X chromosome.
Independently described by Coffin and Lowry, this syndrome is clinically
characterized by neurological, facial, skeletal, dental and cardiac
manifestations.<sup>(<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>The rarity of the condition (1:75,000 people) and the genetic heterogeneity (more
than 140 different mutations have been identified in the RPS6KA3 gene, whose loss of
function determines CLS)<sup>(<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup> justify
the scarcity of information on lung involvement in these individuals. Information on
adult patients is also scarce due to the short life expectancy related to this
condition; a literature review reports that the average survival is 20.5 years (age
range of patients 13 to 34 years),<sup>(<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup> with survival up to 39 years.<sup>(<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>The absence of publications with an emphasis on pulmonary performance in CLS patients
with mechanical ventilation support motivated this case report. We describe a
patient with CLS with respiratory failure due to community pneumonia and his need
for and weaning from mechanical ventilation support during hospitalization in the
intensive care unit (ICU).</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>Patient ALMB was 27 years old and was admitted to the tertiary public hospital of
Brasilia (DF) in June of 2015 due to progressive dyspnea, cough with purulent sputum
and a fever of 38.5&#xB0;C during the 10 days prior to hospitalization. The patient
reported acute sinusitis in the month previous to the hospitalization and had taken
amoxicillin/clavulanate for 10 days. He was treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma (nodular
sclerosis type) in 2008 and met the healing criteria. The physical examination
revealed the external changes and facial dysmorphism typical of CLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>), a brevilineal body type, obesity grade
II (body mass index of 37.6), and a mitral systolic murmur that was discreet and
without irradiation.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Associated with the clinical picture described above, the patient presented with
polyglobulia and plaquetopenia that evolved into epistaxis during hospitalization.
The chest computed tomography (CT) showed a reduction of the right lung volume with
signs of ipsilateral hypoaeration and condensation with air bronchograms in the
lower lobes (more extensive on the right) in addition to cardiomegaly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). The two-dimensional transthoracic
echocardiogram revealed light mitral and tricuspid insufficiency associated with
light pulmonary arterial hypertension (average pulmonary arterial pressure estimated
at 34mmHg).</p>

      </p>
      <p>The patient was hospitalized with a diagnosis of severe community pneumonia, and
antibiotic therapy was initiated with amoxicillin/clavulanate. Due to the
hematological changes, a relapse of lymphoma and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
were investigated but discarded based on the clinical and laboratory criteria.</p>
      <p>The patient worsened with progression to an infectious and respiratory condition with
maintenance of dyspnea and fever. The blood cultures did not show bacterial growth.
An empirical antibiotic escalation to cefepime and azithromycin was performed on day
10 and to meropenem and linezolid on day 11 of hospitalization due to worsening of
the clinical condition.</p>
      <p>On day 15 of hospitalization, the patient presented with acute respiratory failure
with a need for orotracheal intubation and observations of a difficult airway
(Mallampati scale 4). Continuous sedoanalgesia and mechanical ventilation support
were initiated to maintain the partial pressure of the oxygen/inspired fraction
(PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>) at 168. He presented hemodynamic instability
when norepinephrine was initiated and was diagnosed with septic shock and moderate
acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS).</p>
      <p>Initially, the patient was kept under assisted-controlled ventilation with
pressure-cycled inspiratory pressure. The inspiratory pressure was maintained with a
tidal volume between 3 and 6mL/kg of predicted weight, thereby limiting the maximum
distension pressure at 15cmH<sub>2</sub>O and the maximum plateau pressure at
30cmH<sub>2</sub>O. The final positive expiratory pressure (PEEP) was adjusted
according to the best complacency point (PEEP-complacency technique) with the value
fixed at 12cmH<sub>2</sub>O. The respiratory frequency was set at 20irpm. The
FiO<sub>2</sub> was intended to keep the arterial oxygen saturation
(SpO<sub>2</sub>) above 92%, and the maximum FiO<sub>2</sub> used was 80%. No
alveolar recruitment, neuromuscular block or prone position maneuver was
performed.</p>
      <p>Noradrenaline was used for a short period of time (48 hours) at low doses (up to
0.1&#xB5;g/kg/minute). During the first six days, invasive ventilation support was
maintained without difficulties with improved gas exchange and mechanical
ventilation. The distension pressure was always maintained at &#x2264;
15cmH<sub>2</sub>O, and the plateau pressure was maintained at &lt;
30cmH<sub>2</sub>O. In relation to the monitoring of mechanical ventilation, the
static complacency of the respiratory system (Cst) was always &gt;
30mL/cmH<sub>2</sub>O, and the maximum resistance of the airways (Rva) was
18cmH<sub>2</sub>O/L/s.</p>
      <p>On day 7 of mechanical ventilation (MV), a sudden worsening was observed, with an
increase in the parameters (inspiratory pressure and FiO<sub>2</sub>) associated
with ventilator asynchrony, increased Rva and reduced Cst. A massive amount of
semi-thick secretion was observed with the formation of obstructive plugs. The chest
X-ray performed on that day revealed atelectasis at the base of the right lung.
After bronchial hygiene maneuvers, the clinical status was restored, and the
previous parameters were achieved with improvement in the Cst and Rva values (days 8
and 9 of MV). However, on the 9<sup>th</sup> day of MV, new worsening was observed
in the PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>, with the need for high FiO<sub>2</sub>.
Ultrasound of the lung showed B-lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure
3</xref>), but a CT scan of the chest revealed no significant atelectasis areas.
When the PEEP was adjusted to 12cmH<sub>2</sub>O and the water balance was made
negative, an increment in the oxygenation index to 175 was observed within 24
hours.</p>
      <p>
        <fig id="f3" orientation="portrait" position="float">

          <graphic xlink:href="rbti-28-04-0483-gf03"/>
        </fig>
      </p>
      <p>With clinical improvement, ventilation weaning occurred with good evolution through
the progressive reduction of pressure support (PS). Because the patient maintained a
PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio of 280, arterial pH of 7.37, good level of
consciousness based on the ability to obey four commands (open eyes, track examiner,
shaking hands and protrude the tongue), hemodynamic stability, normal axillary
temperature, laboratory test values and a balanced water balance, on day 15 of
respiratory support the spontaneous breathing test was performed with the mechanical
ventilator adjusted to the pressure support mode (PSV) with the PS adjusted to 7, a
PEEP of 5cmH<sub>2</sub>O and FiO<sub>2</sub> of 25%. After the test, the rapid
shallow breathing index (or Tobin index) was 80 breaths/min/L, the systolic blood
pressure was 106mmHg, the cardiac frequency was 102 beats/minute, and no change was
detected in the level of consciousness. Thus, extubation was successfully performed.
Due to the presence of comorbidities and obesity grade II (both considered relative
criteria), the patient was submitted to preventive non-invasive ventilation with one
full-face mask per day for two 2-hour periods.</p>
      <p>The patient was discharged from the ICU after 72 hours under spontaneous breathing
and remained for 6 days in the Hematology ward. Then, the patient was discharged
after a 41-day hospital stay.</p>

    <sec sec-type="discussion">
      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The patient in question has a rare syndrome with above average survival compared with
his peers, especially considering his Hodgkin's lymphoma morbid antecedent. The
patient was seen by a geneticist in 2014 at the age of 25 years when the possibility
of CLS was proposed. Because the patient is the only child with the disease of a
non-consanguineous couple with three other male children, we believed that this case
is an example of a <italic>de novo</italic> mutation that is very prevalent and was
present in up to 68% of CLS patients in a series of cases.<sup>(<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>Invasive ventilation support in these patients has not been addressed in detail in
the medical literature. Aspiration pneumonia may be the most prevalent cause of
respiratory failure among these patients. Stimulus-induced drop episodes (SIDEs),
which are present in 20% of patients, are followed by quick recovery of muscle tone
without loss of consciousness<sup>(<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)</sup>
and are not a cause of bronchoaspiration. Feeding problems, vomiting and
gastroesophageal reflux have been reported,<sup>(<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup> which when associated with neurological commitment can
create a favorable scenario for bronchoaspiration. The patient in this study had a
report of SIDE in February 2013 but no history of feeding difficulties. However,
relatives reported a recent episode of pneumonia treated 3 months prior to
admission.</p>
      <p>Interstitial pneumonia secondary to chemotherapy with bleomycin, which was used by
the patient at the time of lymphoma treatment, was an evaluated differential
diagnosis. However, this hypothesis was discarded through clinical evolution and
mechanical ventilation, and the chest CT was not suggestive of this diagnosis. Chest
deformities were not observed, including <italic>Pectus excavatum</italic> or
<italic>carinatum</italic>, which are prevalent in CLS patients. Although the
clinical status was not suggestive, a histopathological examination that rejected
pulmonary emphysema or pulmonary fibrosis due to chronic incipient aspiration was
performed because these findings were possible in patients with this
syndrome.<sup>(<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>The patient remained under ventilation support for 15 days. The day when support
began was marked by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Moderate ARDS was diagnosed
as proposed by the Berlin Definition (acute start, PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>
between 101 and 200 with PEEP &#x2265; 5cmH<sub>2</sub>O, bilateral lung
condensation and respiratory failure not clearly explained by heart failure or
overhead volume).<sup>(<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>Due to the diagnosis of moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a
protective ventilation strategy was adopted with the use of low tidal volumes
according to the Brazilian Guidelines for Mechanical Ventilation of 2013.<sup>(<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)</sup> This approach consists of the use
of tidal volumes of 3 to 6mL/kg of the predicted weight to maintain a maximum
distension pressure of 15cmH<sub>2</sub>O and a plateau pressure up to
30cmH<sub>2</sub>O. Because several methods have been proposed to adjust the
PEEP in ARDS without clear evidence of superiority, a PEEP-complacency technique was
chosen in which a PEEP of 2cmH<sub>2</sub>O above the best complacency was
established.</p>
      <p>Because the patient maintained the PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> above 150, a prone
position was not adopted. Moreover, we decided not to conduct recruitment maneuvers
because the distension pressure remained below 15cmH<sub>2</sub>O without major
difficulties in tuning the mechanical ventilation. Similarly, a neuromuscular
blocker was not used because the PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> was greater than
120.<sup>(<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>With protective ventilation maintenance, progressive clinical improvement was
observed during the first 6 days of MV, with a reduction of the ventilation
parameters (i.e., inspiratory pressure and FiO<sub>2</sub>). This clinical
improvement of the gaseous exchanges and mechanical ventilation were due to the
action of the antibiotic therapy, the septic shock resolution and the reduction of
the inflammatory process.</p>
      <p>The instability of the ventilation status observed on day 7 of the mechanical
ventilation, with increased Rva and reduced Cst, was explained by the formation of
obstructive plugs and atelectasis in the lower right lobe, which are complications
that must be researched in the face of acute changes in patients under MV. The
worsening of gas exchanges observed on the ninth day of MV was attributed to
pulmonary congestion by water excess because the changes were quickly reversed by
making the water balance negative and slightly increasing the PEEP to
12cmH<sub>2</sub>O. The B-lines in the pulmonary ultrasound corroborated the
diagnostic hypothesis of pulmonary congestion. Additionally, antibiotic escalation
had already occurred to keep the infectious status under control despite the
severity associated with septic shock under treatment.</p>
      <p>The continuous administration of analgesia with opioid (fentanyl) was maintained with
progressive withdrawal to reduce sympathetic stimulation and prevent the increase in
peripheral vascular resistance and, consequently, myocardial stress.<sup>(<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>)</sup> Decreasing pressure support was
used until the time of extubation on the fifteenth day of support. Due to the
favorable evolution, we made a choice to not perform a tracheostomy before the
possibility of extubation success.</p>
      <p>We believe that the successful ventilation weaning occurred due to the absence of
cardiomyopathy in the patient. The existence of comorbidities such as
cardiomyopathies associated or not with valvulopathies is common in individuals with
CLS. The momentary dependency on the vasopressor corroborates the echocardiographic
findings of good heart performance.</p>
      <p>Despite mortality associated with this clinical entity (32%), the patient had a
favorable evolution and remained in respiratory support during the time expected for
moderate ARDS by the literature (4 - 14 days).<sup>(<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>We hope that similar reports will enrich our knowledge of patients with CLS under
mechanical ventilation support, allow the establishment of ventilation strategies
and provide specifics on the syndrome. Recognizing specific patterns of organic
responses in these individuals when under critical care will result in agreed-upon
actions.</p>
