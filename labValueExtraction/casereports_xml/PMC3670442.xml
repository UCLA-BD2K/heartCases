      <abstract>
        <p>Depression and comorbid cognitive impairment in the elderly can be difficult to
distinguish from dementia. Adding to the complex differential is that depression
may be part of a bipolar illness rather than a unipolar mood disorder. A
diligent workup and close monitoring of patients can inform appropriate
treatment and can make the difference between recovery and persistence of
symptoms. The present case will illustrate how a comprehensive workup utilizing
extensive data gathering, laboratory workup, use of neuropsychological testing,
neuroimaging, and timely treatment can lead to successful clinical outcomes that
can be sustained for many years.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The elderly can present with two different patterns of mixed affective-cognitive
disturbances. The first refers to a primary mood disturbance accompanied by a
cognitive disturbance, while the second refers to a primary dementing illness that
is accompanied by a secondary major depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. When severe, the first type has also been called
pseudodementia or dementia of depression. Several overlapping features make it hard
to differentiate between the two. A major difference, however, is that
pseudodementia is a reversible cognitive impairment. This differential prognosis of
pseudodementia requires a timely diagnosis and adequate treatment of depression,
which can represent the difference between recovery and the persistence of symptoms.
The diagnosis and treatment of this type of depression can be even more complex if
it is part of a bipolar spectrum rather than a unipolar illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>We discuss a case that illustrates the difficulties in distinguishing between these
two presentations.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s2">
      <title>Case Presentation</title>
      <p>The patient is a 76-year-old Caucasian male, a successful professional who was
working full time until about 2 months prior to admission to our hospital. He was
first admitted to another psychiatric hospital for a month after he reportedly made
a suicide gesture by pointing a gun to his head and firing two shots into the
ceiling. In recent months, the patient had been very concerned about developing
Alzheimer&#x2019;s dementia after one of his close friends was sent to a nursing home for
advanced dementia. Over the prior 6 months, he was reported to have become very
confused, paranoid, and distrusting of other people. He was often tearful at times
and had reported significant &#x201C;guilt&#x201D; to his wife. Per him and his family, he was
working 12 to 15 hours a day, but his work output was significantly diminished. He
was also described as sleeping only 2 to 3 hours at night. The patient was admitted
to a community psychiatric hospital where, over a period of 1 month, he exhibited
fluctuating orientation levels, cognitive deficits such as anomia, grossly
disorganized speech and thinking, and severe memory loss. His Folstein Mini Mental
Status Examination (MMSE) score varied between 13 and 23 points (out of 30) during
this hospitalization. He would rarely eat because of his depressed mood as well as
significant paranoia that someone had poisoned his food. He reportedly suffered a
weight loss of 20 pounds in 60 days. He displayed marked impairment in his
activities of daily living as well. A diagnosis of Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise
Specified (NOS) and possible Alzheimer&#x2019;s dementia was made, and he was initially
given a trial of haloperidol and olanzapine for 3 to 4 days but developed extra
pyramidal side effects and hypotension from these medications, respectively. He was
then started on sertraline 50 mg, with the dose gradually titrated up to 150 mgs a
day, and risperidone, gradually titrated to 2 mgs BID. His family reported that his
paranoia increased despite these medications. Because the patient had made no
improvement in clinical status after an almost 30-day stay in a community hospital
and treating doctors recommended a transfer to a nursing facility in the future, he
was transferred to our academic teaching hospital as per his family wishes.</p>
      <sec id="s2a">
        <title>Hospital Course at our Facility</title>
        <p>After his admission to our hospital, he continued to have cognitive impairment as
well as affective symptoms. We interviewed his family and obtained permission to
interview his work staff extensively to get a detailed longitudinal history. We
found out that he had a history of a &#x201C;breakdown&#x201D; about 20 years prior to the
current episode, after working &#x201C;long hours for many days&#x201D; where he &#x201C;couldn&#x2019;t
slow down.&#x201D; During that episode, he flew for an impromptu trip across the
country with his friends. On the trip, he had an anxiety attack, and he was
firmly convinced that it was a heart attack. He received alprazolam to &#x201C;slow his
mind down&#x201D; in the emergency room of a hospital, where he was worked up for what
he believed was a myocardial infarction. After a reportedly normal cardiology
workup, the patient was discharged from the hospital with PRN alprazolam. He had
no other psychiatric or substance abuse history and until recently had been a
very successful and productive professional who would often work extra-long
hours without feeling tired. Personality wise, he was described to us by his
staff and family as a very flamboyant, boastful, and charming individual, who
was &#x201C;full of energy&#x201D; and &#x201C;extremely driven.&#x201D; In his moments of guilt, while he
was still showing significant apathy and cognitive disturbance, he told us about
some prior episodes of hyper sexuality and indiscrete behaviors that he had not
shared with anyone before. His wife also mentioned to us he had a liking for
&#x201C;good things&#x201D; in life, including &#x201C;fancy cars and younger women,&#x201D; and despite his
indiscreet behaviors, she had always remained very devoted to him. Even though
he had never been treated or officially diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder,
these symptoms suggested a lifelong undiagnosed bipolar disorder (with possible
hypomanic episodes in the past) or a possible late life onset bipolar disorder
most recent episode mixed versus depressed with psychotic features.</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s3">
      <title>Baseline Laboratory Investigations</title>
      <p>Routine chemistries done at the previous hospital were found to be within normal
limits. Although our main differential diagnosis was an affective illness, a broad
range of lab tests were ordered by us to evaluate the patient&#x2019;s complex cognitive
and psychiatric condition. Some of the conditions we ruled out included common and
uncommon causes of cognitive impairments in the elderly such as HIV, neurosyphilis,
vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, Porphyrias, hyperparathyroidism, neoplastic and
paraneopalstic syndromes, etc. Patient&#x2019;s liver function tests, serum protein
electrophoresis, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, serum heavy metals, HIV, RPR,
porphyrins, urine electrolytes, ceruloplasmin, folate, vitamin B12, methylmalonic
acid levels, thyroid stimulating hormone, and anti-nuclear cytoplasmic antibody were
also normal. Patient&#x2019;s serum ionized calcium at admission was 1.42mmol/lt and was
1.41mmol/lt at discharge (normal range = 1.10-1.30mmol/lt). However patient&#x2019;s
parathyroid hormone (PTH), parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrp), vitamin D
25, OH and 1, 25 Di Hydroxy, and vitamin D were normal. Anti-nuclear antibody was
positive with speckled appearance, titer 1:80 of non-significance. C- Reactive
Protein (CRP), a non-specific inflammatory marker, was elevated at 25.2mg/l. The
patient&#x2019;s erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was mildly elevated to 20mm/hr. The
patient&#x2019;s routine EEG obtained in awake and drowsy states was normal.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s4">
      <title>Baseline Neuropsychological Testing</title>
      <p>Patient had shown a great deal of fluctuation in his MMSE at the previous hospital.
It was notable that this fluctuation on MMSE was not specific to orientation in
time, place, or person, which would have been indicative of a delirious process. The
fluctuations rather seemed to be related to be being unmotivated to finish testing
or being paranoid at times. We decided to consult for neuropsychology testing to get
a better picture of patient&#x2019;s cognitive deficits. Cognitive tests including the
RBANS (Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status) and Trail
Making Test were administered given the patient&#x2019;s perplexing clinical presentation
and history. RBANS is a brief neurocognitive battery measuring immediate and delayed
memory, attention, language, and visuospatial skills. It was developed for two main
applications: as a standalone battery for the detection and neurocognitive
characterization of dementia and as a brief neurocognitive battery for the detection
and tracking of neurocognitive deficits in a variety of disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>Results of the first testing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) showed
a significant impairment in attention span, memory, and executive function,
suggesting a possible neuro-degenerative condition such as dementia.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s5">
      <title>Neuroimaging Studies</title>
      <p>MRI scan of the head was normal. Given the lack of a high resolution functional
imager such as a PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scan at our hospital, a Single
Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) was ordered after the MRI to evaluate
regional cerebral blood flow and to look for patterns consistent with
neurodegenerative disorders. The SPECT scan showed moderate hypoperfusion within the
left parietal lobe/temporoparietal cortex. There was also mild hypoperfusion within
the right parietal lobe/posterior temporoparietal and the frontal lobe, more evident
within the left frontal lobe relative to the right. There were no findings
compatible with a cerebral vascular accident. Perfusion within the thalamus, the
cerebellum, the occipital lobe cortex, and visual cortex were within normal
limits.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s6">
      <title>Diagnosis, Treatment, and Hospital Course</title>
      <p>Once the initial workup was complete and other medical illness was ruled out, the
patient was diagnosed with bipolar illness most recent episode mixed versus
depressed with psychotic features. His medications were gradually cross tapered from
risperidone 2mg BID to aripiprazole, which was eventually titrated to 30 mg once a
day. Aripiprazole was chosen as it is an FDA-approved agent for treatment of mania
and mixed episodes in bipolar illness in adults. It is also an FDA-approved
medication for augmentation agent for major depressive disorder in adults. It was
also chosen as it is one of the less sedating atypical antipsychotic agents with a
lower anticholinergic profile, hence a lower propensity to cause confusion and
hypotensive effects compared with other atypical antipsychotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>The patient&#x2019;s family had reported worsening of depression with sertraline 150mg, so
it was gradually cross-tapered to a combination of venlafaxine extended release
(gradually increased to 300mg once a day) and mirtazapine (eventually increased to
45mg at bed time). Venlafaxine was chosen as it is a dual, serotonergic, and
noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Mirtazapine was also chosen as it has a positive effect on sleep
and appetite as well as depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. While we were significantly concerned about
polypharmacy in a 76-year-old man, the combination of two antidepressants along with
aripiprazole was chosen because of the severity of his depression and rapidly
deteriorating status. Patient&#x2019;s family was not agreeable to trying other potentially
effective agents such as lithium or ECT to alleviate his depression and psychotic
symptoms. Later, the patient was also started on galantamine 4mg 2 times a day to
address cognitive impairment. Gradually, 10 to 12 days after starting the new
medication regimen, the patient started to show improvement in his psychomotor
retardation, appetite, sleep, thought process, and paranoia. With the improvement in
his condition, a diagnosis of dementia was less likely so we tapered off the
galantamine. Had the patient&#x2019;s symptoms not improved and his diagnosis remained
dementia, we would have possibly increased the dose of galantamine rather than
discontinuing it. Atypical antipsychotics are commonly used to treat aggression and
psychotic symptoms in dementia. However, the FDA has issued a black box warning that
elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with atypical antipsychotic
drugs are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. If patient had true
dementia, we would have very been cautious about using a high dose of aripiprazole.
We would have possibly continued mirtazapine to help patient with sleep and
appetite. A bigger challenge would have been to discuss a future course of action,
including suitable placement for the patient in a nursing home. Fortunately, the
patient had a complete remission of symptoms as his diagnosis indeed turned out to
be a bipolar illness.</p>
      <p>At the time of discharge, almost 1 month after admission, patient&#x2019;s CRP and ESR
normalized. Studies have shown that in old age, depressed mood is associated with
high levels of inflammatory markers, suggesting that depressed mood is causing
and/or caused by systemic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. It is significant that in our case, CRP and ESR values came
down to normal after successful treatment.</p>
      <p>Repeat neuropsychological testing was obtained at the time of discharge and showed
significant improvement compared with admission. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, his scores improved significantly
relative to scores at admission and were now all in the average range except the
Delayed Memory Index, which showed improvement and was now in the Borderline range.
His Geriatric Depression Scale score improved to within normal limits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s7">
      <title>Long-Term Follow-Up</title>
      <p>Over the 2 months following his discharge from the hospital, we discontinued his
antidepressants venlafaxine and mirtazapine as we thought his mixed-depressive
symptoms were more on a bipolar spectrum rather than just a unipolar depressive
disorder. We also changed aripiprazole to quetiapine 300 mg at bed time as patient
was noted to have akathisia symptoms of fidgetiness and reported constant &#x201C;inner
restlessness.&#x201D; As mentioned above, we had discontinued the galantamine earlier, as
patient had no evidence of residual cognitive impairment whatsoever. Six months
after discharge from our hospital, the patient transferred his care to a community
psychiatrist near his house who questioned the diagnosis of bipolar disorder and
discontinued quetiapine as well. Soon thereafter, the patient experienced a relapse
with a similar but milder episode, including cognitive symptoms as well as paranoia,
sleep disturbance, and racing thoughts. He was briefly hospitalized to our facility
again and was restabilized on quetiapine 300mg at bed time, lorazepam 0.5mg as
needed, and zolpidem 6.25mg at bed time.</p>
      <p>At 4-year follow-up, patient remained on quetiapine 300mg QHS, off and on lorazepam
0.5mg PRN, and zolpidem 6.25mg at bed time to help with anxiety and sleep,
respectively. Although he had cut down on his professional work, he stayed very
productive. Despite significant psychosocial stressors including a worsening
economy, moving, and family problems, he did not have a relapse or required a
further hospitalization for the last 4 years. His MMSE continued to be 30 on every
subsequent visit, and he had no adverse effect from any of his medications. In
August 2010, neuropsychological testing was again repeated and results are presented
in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Thus, at 4-year follow-up, all
scores including Delayed Memory were in the average range, and the patient&#x2019;s
depression score remained normal.</p>
      <p>After doing well for more than 5 years, patient decompensated again in June 2012
after his wife was diagnosed with a neoplasm. His initial symptoms were again of
confusion, paranoia, and sleep disturbance. We gradually increased the dose of
quetiapine to up to 600mg a day in divided doses. However, he had to be hospitalized
after a few weeks as his cognitive and affective symptoms worsened. He began to
refuse food because of his paranoia and stopped doing his activities of daily
living, including showering and shaving. Given a lack of response to an increased
dose of quetiapine, the inpatient team switched him back to a combination of
aripiprazole 30mg once a day, venlafaxine 225mg once a day, and mirtazepine 45mg at
bed time, a combination he had responded well to previously. His cognitive and
affective symptoms continued to stay somewhat impaired despite being on the new
medication regimen for over 3 weeks. Since the patient&#x2019;s condition was not improving
satisfactorily with medications alone and he did not have the capacity to give
informed consent for Electro Convulsive Therapy (ECT) treatment, an ECT against will
hearing was scheduled to achieve a faster alleviation his symptoms. A probate judge
granted permission to start ECT, and he was started on Right Unilateral ECT, two
times a week. After four ineffective treatments of Right Unilateral ECT, he was
switched to Bi Frontal ECT. After two treatments with Bi Frontal ECT, his symptoms
of cognitive, affective, and paranoia completely resolved. There were no adverse
effects noticed or reported from ECT treatment. The patient continued with
maintenance ECT treatment for 2 months. At the time of submission of this
manuscript, the patient had stopped mantainence ECT treatment. He was tapered off
aripiprazole and venlafaxine as he developed akathisia again. He was tapered off
mirtazapine as he had a sleeping walking episode from it. We transferred his care to
a psychiatrist near his house as commuting to us was becoming a problem. After
discussions with us, his new psychiatrist switched him over to a combination of
lithium 300mg once a day and loxapine 10mg once a day. Patient tolerated the changes
very well without resurgence of mood symptoms, cognitive symptoms, or akathisia.
Reportedly, he has resumed his work and all other activities as well. It is notable
that during the last 3 years, two of the patient&#x2019;s children and grandchildren have
also suffered from manic episodes and major depression with psychotic features,
further confirming a strong genetic loading of mood disorder in his family. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> summarizes the patient&#x2019;s important
clinical events and medication periods and helps frame the reader to the timeline of
his disease onset and recovery.</p>

    <sec sec-type="discussion" id="s8">
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our case illustrates the challenges clinicians face in the evaluation and treatment
of impaired cognitive functioning presenting in the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. The patient&#x2019;s presentation included
both depressive symptoms and cognitive difficulties, the latter being so pronounced
that a comprehensive subacute dementia and an acute cerebrovascular workup were
ordered. Our case shows that the distinction between &#x201C;organic&#x201D; cognitive symptoms
(thought of as symptoms due to structural or neurodegenerative, irreversible
conditions) and &#x201C;functional&#x201D; symptoms (thought of as symptoms due to reversible
conditions, usually psychiatric in nature) can be challenging using our current
diagnostic nosology. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> further
highlights the overlap between symptoms of bipolar disorder and pseudodementia,
demonstrating the subtleties in the diagnosis. The patient&#x2019;s cognitive presentation
and neuroimaging results were consistent with a neurodegenerative condition such as
Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease. Because of the mismatch of a dementia diagnosis with the
time-course of symptoms, we hypothesized that the patient&#x2019;s disordered thought
process (i.e., due to a primary mood or psychotic disorder) might be more central to
his presentation. As a result of treatment for affective symptoms, the patient&#x2019;s
cognitive symptoms and associated neuropsychological symptoms abnormalities reversed
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>This supports two hypotheses: 1) that the distinction between &#x201C;functional&#x201D; and
&#x201C;organic&#x201D; conditions may be impossible to make based on our current diagnostic
tests, since the diagnosis of most &#x201C;organic&#x201D; conditions are made by autopsy; and/or
2) that different etiological conditions may present similarly based on the neural
circuits they affect, circuits whose dysfunction can be observed clinically and via
neuroimaging methods.</p>
      <p>The question arises as to whether our patient&#x2019;s depression may represent a prodrome
of a later dementing process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Although this has not yet occurred over 6 years of follow-up,
we cannot predict how our patient&#x2019;s affective symptoms will progress over time.</p>
      <p>In recent literature, some authors conclude that reversible cognitive impairment in
late life moderate to severe depression appears to be a strong predictor of later
onset dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Even
when the cognitive impairment improves with the treatment of the depressive
symptoms, patients are still at a substantially greater risk for dementia than
demographically similar people without depression. In a study of more than 1,000
individuals over 60 years of age living in a community, baseline depressed mood was
associated with a moderately increased risk for incident dementia at follow-up
examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Other
authors have suggested that depression with reversible cognitive impairment may be
an early phase of dementia rather than a risk factor for it. One hypothesis
postulates that people with higher cognitive reserves are able to compensate enough
at baseline so that their cognition stays marginal but out of the clinical arena
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Any additional
insult to their brain, however (such as a physical illness or depression),
overwhelms their already strained cognitive reserves and these people&#x2019;s cognition
crosses the threshold of clinical impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Should the physical illness, depression, or other
brain insult improve, these patients&#x2019; cognitive abilities may return but not to
baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Thus, brain
insults such as depression obviate the patients&#x2019; decreased cognitive reserves. Some
authors recommend that patients with dementia of depression have a full dementia
screening, comprehensive cognitive testing, and ongoing monitoring of their
cognitive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>This case brings to highlight the phenomenon of late life onset bipolar illness
presenting as pseudodementia. New onset of bipolar disorder becomes less common with
age, but late onset bipolar disorder may still constitute about 5 percent to 8
percent of all annual inpatient psychiatric admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Some studies have suggested that 6 percent to 8 percent of
patients with bipolar illness may have a late life onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Some authors have defined this
late onset of mixed affective and cognitive symptoms as bipolar type VI, a variant
of the broader bipolar spectrum illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. This presentation of bipolar illness seems to have a lower
association with family history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], and patients generally have a higher premorbid psychosocial
functioning as compared to early onset illness before the age 65 years. Even
euthymic elders with late onset bipolar illness when compared to age matched
controls seem do worse in domains of cognition, language, and executive functioning
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Some
older literature has described symptoms as mixed or agitated depressive states with
overexpression of complaints, occasional hyper sexuality, irritability, and motor
agitations often bordering pseudo-hysteria or histrionic personality disorder
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Mania in elderly
often may be secondary to a physical illness. A truly frank manic picture may be
mistaken for dementia or an organic brain disease even if it is indeed a primary
affective illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Therefore, before beginning a
specific treatment especially in the elderly, neuroimaging to rule out
cerebrovascular organic disease is of paramount importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>].</p>
      <p>There are no clear guidelines available to treat late life onset bipolar illness
presenting as pseudodementia. In addition to a thorough medical workup and
psychiatric assessment, a firm understanding of baseline psychosocial functioning
and timeline of events is very important. Besides affective symptoms, our patient
also had paranoia, so we did not try a traditional mood stabilizer first and
straight away tried an atypical antipsychotic. It is reported that mood stabilizers
in the form of anticonvulsants are better tolerated in the elderly with bipolar
illness than lithium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>].
However, recently this particular patient has now been switched to lithium and is
tolerating it well. It is also suggested that acute mania responds well to valproate
and atypical antipsychotics in the same population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Pseudodementia associated with late onset bipolar
illness, when treated with only antidepressants and or acetylcholinesterases, may
worsen or aggravate symptoms by unmasking mania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. These challenges call for closer clinical follow up
and monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Other
forms of treatment such as ECT may be tried in refractory cases as evidenced by
several mixed age studies. There is a serious dearth of literature on treatment of
this condition and most available literature is currently extrapolated from case
series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] and mixed age population studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Further research and high quality
longitudinal studies needed to shed light on the various neuropsychiatric
associations and management of late life onset bipolar illness and its associated
complications such as pseudo-dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].</p>
