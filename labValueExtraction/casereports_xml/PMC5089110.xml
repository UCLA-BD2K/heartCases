          <title>Background:</title>
          <p>Cystic angiomatosis (CA) is a rare disorder causing bony cysts. It displays some similarity to Gorham&#x2013;Stout disease (GSD), but has a much better local prognosis, despite the larger number of cysts. These 2 conditions also differ in terms of their location, visceral involvement, and response to treatment.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec sec-type="methods">
          <title>Methods:</title>
          <p>We report 4 cases of CA, including 1 sclerosing form, which we compare with cases from a literature review performed with PRISMA methodology.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec sec-type="results">
          <title>Results:</title>
          <p>We reviewed 38 articles describing 44 other patients. Mean age at diagnosis for the 48 patients (our 4 patients&#x200A;+&#x200A;the 44 from the review) was 22.5 years, and 28 of the patients were men. The femur was involved in 81% (n = 39), the pelvis in 73% (n = 35), the humerus in 52% (n = 25), the skull in 48% (n = 23), and the vertebrae in 44% (n = 21). Visceral lymphangiomatosis (either clinical, or detected on autopsy) was also reported in 35% (n = 18) of the patients. The spleen was the most frequently involved organ (n = 12), followed by the lungs and pleura (n = 8). Liver cysts and/or chylothorax were rarely reported (5 cases), but were invariably fatal. Radiation therapy on bone or soft tissue masses was ineffective, as was interferon alpha, in the 2 patients in which this drug was tested. The efficacy of bisphosphonate was at best equivocal.</p>

        <sec sec-type="conclusion">
          <title>Conclusion:</title>
          <p>The progression of CA is unpredictable and treatments effective against GSD, such as bisphosphonates and radiotherapy, have proved ineffective for this condition. New treatments are thus urgently required.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cystic angiomatosis (CA) is a rare disease characterized by multifocal bony cysts with a honeycombed or &#x201C;bubble&#x201D; appearance, but without aggressive osteolysis. It varies in severity from frequent mild forms with skeletal abnormalities discovered fortuitously on X-rays, to rare severe forms with widespread visceral lymphangiomatosis causing early death.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[1]</sup></xref> Men seem to be more frequently affected than women, with a sex ratio of 2:1.<sup>[</sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>]</sup>
</p>
      <p>Imaging reveals typical features. The lesions are multifocal, well-defined, skeletal intramedullary cysts, with a relatively well-preserved bony cortex,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[4]</sup></xref> and no periosteal reaction, even if the cysts are located just beneath the cortex. The cysts are oriented over the long axis of the bone, and are classically surrounded by a sclerotic peripheral rim.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[5]</sup></xref> On macroscopic examination, the cysts may appear empty or filled with a colorless or &#x201C;pinkish&#x201D; bloody proteinaceous material.<sup>[</sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>]</sup> On histological examination, vascular channels with a single layer of flattened endothelial cells are typically observed.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[2]</sup></xref>
</p>
      <p>As these cells are lymphatic, some authors have suggested that this disorder should be called &#x201C;generalized lymphatic abnormality&#x201D; (GLA) rather than &#x201C;cystic angiomatosis&#x201D; (CA),<sup>[</sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>]</sup> particularly as tissues other than bone may be affected. However, although GLA does indeed commonly affect bone, this condition is often both congenital and fatal.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[10]</sup></xref> We restricted our review to patients with typical CA, which remains a benign disorder in most cases.</p>
      <p>Neither peripheral soft tissue involvement nor a periosteal reaction are observed in CA,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[1]</sup></xref> facilitating differential diagnosis from metastasis, multiple myeloma, or other malignant conditions. CA has a number of features in common with Gorham&#x2013;Stout disease (GSD), but it differs in several aspects. CA has a much better prognosis, the rim of the cysts has a sclerotic appearance on X-rays and sclerosing lesions rather than osteolysis are sometimes observed. These elements suggest a possible difference in the pathogenesis of these 2 conditions, although they are probably closely related. We report here 4 new cases of CA diagnosed in the past 10 years at a single university hospital, including 1 case with an osteosclerotic pattern, which we have compared with previously reported cases of CA.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>We carried out a systematic literature review with the PubMed and Medline databases, by the PRISMA method.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[11]</sup></xref>
</p>
      <p>We selected articles published in English, with no restriction on the date of publication. The first author screened titles, abstracts, and full texts. The second author was consulted if the diagnosis seemed unclear, and articles were included if both authors agreed. Articles were excluded if important information (clinical or imaging features) was missing.</p>
      <p>The key words used for the search were: polycystic, and/or cystic and bone, and/or skeletal, and/or skeleton, and angiomatosis or hemangiomatosis.</p>
      <p>We identified 170 potentially relevant articles in PubMed and Medline databases. After the removal of duplicates, 151 articles remained, 100 of which were excluded (73 articles were considered nonrelevant once the title and abstract had been read, and 27 articles were published in a language other than English); 51 abstracts were screened, fifteen of which were excluded as they were considered nonrelevant. We therefore assessed 36 full-text articles for eligibility. Two of these articles were excluded because they contained incomplete clinical and imaging data. We finally retained 34 articles for this study. Another 4 articles were identified with Google scholar, all of which were included in this study with the agreement of all authors, leading to 38 articles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Informed consent was collected for the 4 patients before we report their case in this article.</p>

      <title>Observation/results</title>
      <p>The first case was a 26-year-old woman referred to us in 2006 for severe neck pain of 1 year duration. She had a medical history of untreated asthma and depression. Clinical examination showed neither stiffness nor associated radicular pain. The general examination was normal. Blood analysis revealed only lymphopenia (500&#x200A;lymphocytes/mm<sup>3</sup> (N = 1500&#x2013;4000)), principally concerning CD4<sup>+</sup> (141/mm<sup>3</sup>; normal range (N = 500&#x2013;1200/mm<sup>3</sup>), and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells (189/mm<sup>3</sup>; N = 300&#x2013;700/mm<sup>3</sup>)) T cells, with B- and natural killer cells (NK cells) levels in the normal range. Cervical X-rays and computerized tomography scan (CT scan) of the cervical spine showed spontaneous C5&#x2013;C6 vertebral dislocation with osteolytic C5 and C6 posterior arches and zygapophyseal joint cystic lesions (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The patient underwent emergency laminectomy surgery and posterior osteosynthesis. No malignant cells were found on histological examination. The bone marrow spaces appeared to be filled with fibrous and edematous tissue associated with vascular structures consistent with hemangioma. No other bone or visceral lesions were found. No neurological impairment occurred.</p>

      <p>Four months after surgery, the patient reported a recurrence of cervical pain and C6 radicular pain. Clinical examination showed no neurological impairment. Cervical X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed progression of the lytic intravertebral lesion at C5 and a spontaneous recurrence of C5&#x2013;C6 dislocation. The patient underwent emergency surgery again, with C4&#x2013;C7 arthrodesis and anterior cervical osteosynthesis. Radicular and cervical pain improved after surgery and remained stable thereafter.</p>
      <p>Bisphosphonate treatment was initiated 3 months after surgery. Zoledronic acid (4&#x200A;mg) was administered intravenously after vitamin D intake, once every 6 months for 2 years. In 2009, the patient complained of acute severe cervical spine pain radiating to the face. MRI showed prevertebral soft tissue swelling at C2 compressing the left second vertebral nerve. This pain improved spontaneously. In 2011, mediastinal cystic lesions were detected on a control MRI scan, with no associated symptoms. A Positron emission tomography (PET) scan was then performed to assess tumor mass, but no 18-fluorodesoxyglucose (FDG) uptake was observed. The patient has a routine control MRI scan once per year, and no relapse has since occurred. The patient had received 9 bisphosphonate infusions (once per year) by 2015. These infusions were well-tolerated and stabilized the bony lesions.</p>
      <p>The second case was a 38-year-old man with low back pain of 3 years&#x2019; duration radiating to the legs and the right buttock, without causing a limp. He had a history of smoking and depression. The results of physical and biological examinations were normal. Lumbar and pelvic X-rays and CT scans showed cystic lesions of both the ilium and left sacral bones, with a sclerotic rim and partial cortical osteolysis of the right iliac crest (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). MRI was therefore performed. The cystic lesions yielded a high-intensity signal on T2-weighted sequences and an isointense signal on T1-weighted sequences, suggestive of liquid cysts with a fatty component. As the pain was disabling, the patient underwent pelvic cementoplasty in 2008, leading to partial pain relief. In 2009, the low back pain increased with bilateral S1 radiation. The patient underwent pelvic cementoplasty again, with better results. A right iliac crest biopsy was performed during the first cementoplasty procedure, but no meaningful histological analysis was possible because the sample obtained was too small. The patient also complained of severe headaches. He therefore also underwent brain and spinal cord angio-MRI, which showed that there were no aneurysms present. No other visceral involvement was suspected. In 2013, 7 years after diagnosis, the patient's lesions were completely stable on X-ray evaluation.</p>

      <p>The third case was a 30-year-old woman referred to us in 2009 for heterogeneous lytic and sclerosing cystic bony lesions discovered on a routine X-rays examination. She had a history of spontaneously resolving thrombopenia during a pregnancy in 2008. A clinical examination in 2009 revealed splenomegaly. The patient was otherwise healthy. Blood analysis results were normal, with the exception of thrombocytosis (476&#x200A;&#xD7;&#x200A;10<sup>9</sup> platelets per liter; N = 150&#x2013;400&#x200A;&#xD7;&#x200A;10<sup>9</sup>/L). Ultrasound measurements showed the spleen to be more than 20&#x200A;cm long. X-rays and PET scans were performed for a more detailed assessment of splenomegaly. These examinations revealed the presence of lytic cystic lesions of the T12 vertebra, sclerosing lesions of the L2 and L5 lumbar vertebrae and poor vascular uptake (standardized uptake value (SUV) max of 2.3; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), together with lytic lesions of the head of the left humerus and the right iliac crest. A diagnosis of histiocytosis X was suggested and the patient underwent splenectomy. Angiomatous features were observed on histological examination of the spleen. Iliac crest biopsy showed mixed tissue, with positive staining for CD31. Vascular uptake at sclerosing spots was observed on a bone scan (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). MRI revealed features typical of CA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). The patient underwent her first intravenous infusion of 5&#x200A;mg zoledronic acid, after vitamin D reloading, in 2010. The vertebral lesions remained stable on a spinal CT scan performed 4 months later.</p>

      <p>The fourth patient was a 52-year-old woman who was referred for bilateral knee joint pain. She had no relevant personal or familial medical history. Clinical examination was normal with the exception of the presence of widespread brown nevi. An X-ray of the knees was normal, but a 99mtc bone scan revealed vascular uptake in both knees, with no other abnormalities (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). Knee MRI revealed the presence of multiple cystic lesions of variable size (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). On T2 sequences, a high-intensity signal was observed in the cystic areas, suggesting that the cysts contained liquid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). Biopsy was proposed several times, but was systematically refused by the patient. A diagnosis of CA was proposed on the basis of the radiological and clinical features. The bony cysts stabilized during follow-up, with no further growth of existing cysts and no new cysts appearing. The pain improved spontaneously. Three years later, the patient presented a nodular lesion of the head of the pancreas. A biopsy was carried out and histological findings were consistent with glucagonoma. The patient underwent surgery and experienced no further relapse. After 6 years of follow-up, 2 pulmonary nodules 2 to 4&#x200A;mm in diameter and 1 hepatic nodule 5&#x200A;mm in diameter were identified on a full-body CT scan. No progression of these nodules was observed on a full-body CT scan carried out 2 years later. The patient is still alive, 18 years after diagnosis.</p>

      <title>Discussion and review</title>
      <p>We included 38 articles in the review. These articles described 44 patients. Together with our 4 patients, we therefore considered data for 48 patients in total. The mean age of these patients was 22.5 years, and there were 28 men and 20 women. The sex ratio was thus 1.4, indicating that men were more likely than women to be diagnosed with CA.</p>
      <p>CA is a rare nonmalignant vascular tumor of the bone causing skeletal cysts, which are often associated with extraskeletal cysts. Parsons and Ebbs<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[7]</sup></xref> provided the first description of this condition in 1940, in a 13-year-old girl referred for presternal and supraclavicular soft tissue swelling. Clinical examination revealed spleen enlargement. X-rays revealed the presence of several bony cystic lacunae in the skull, sternum, humeri, ribs, pelvis, femurs, tibia, and right fibula. The patient died of acute respiratory failure. Cysts were found in the spleen, lungs, and liver on autopsy. Histological examination of bony and soft tissues showed &#x201C;purplish black cysts&#x201D; containing fluid, with &#x201C;angiomatous spaces&#x201D; lined by a layer of endothelial cells. Several authors subsequently described similar cases of CA with or without visceral involvement (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>

          <p>CA cysts are often completely asymptomatic, and diagnosis is therefore often fortuitous, on X-rays taken for other reasons. Growth plate closure and remodeling during growth remain unaffected.<sup>[</sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

            <p>CA typically presents as multifocal well-defined intramedullary cysts with a sclerotic peripheral rim, a preserved bony cortex, and no periosteal reaction.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[1]</sup></xref> However, exceptions have been reported. For instance, our first patient experienced a spontaneous C5&#x2013;C6 vertebral dislocation with osteolytic C5 and C6 posterior arches and zygapophyseal joint cystic lesions (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), and our second patient presented with cortical osteolysis of the ilium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This feature is very rare in CA, but the MRI scan was otherwise typical of this condition. To our knowledge, only one other author has described an isolated femoral neck cortical lytic cyst<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[33]</sup></xref> in a patient with histological features of a biopsied lesion fully consistent with CA (cystic vascular spaces lined with a single layer of endothelial cells).

            <p>Other unusual radiological aspects have also been reported, including sclerosing cysts or osteosclerotic patchy areas within the cysts (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>).<sup>[</sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

Reid et al<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[18]</sup></xref> described a familial case series in which more than 10 years of follow-up data were available for some patients. One of these patients displayed a shift from a lytic to a sclerosing appearance on X-ray.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[18]</sup></xref> Two of our patients (Cases 1 and 4) had asymptomatic cysts with heterogeneous lytic and sclerosing patterns.

            <p>Several bones may be affected in the same patient, and lytic CA can mimic many conditions: bone metastasis (either osteolytic or condensing), lymphoma, fibrous dysplasia, histiocytosis, brown tumors of hyperparathyroidism.

        <p>GSD is also known as disappearing (or vanishing) bone disease, highlighting its main feature: massive and progressive osteolysis. Some authors have suggested that GSD and CA are part of the same disease entity, simply differing in terms of the severity of osteolysis. Indeed, histological findings are very similar for these 2 conditions, with cysts (in CA) or fibrous tissue (in GSD) separated by bony trabeculae covered with a single layer of flattened endothelial cells, with few cellular abnormalities, if any (contrasting with bone hemangiomas<sup>[</sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>]</sup>). Similarly, lymphangiomatosis, rather than hemangiomatosis, is found in both conditions.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[32]</sup></xref> However, most authors agree that CA and GSD should be seen either as 2 separate conditions, or at least as being located at the 2 ends of a single spectrum.

          <title>Better prognosis in cystic angiomatosis than in Gorham&#x2013;Stout disease</title>
          <p>The main difference is that GSD usually leads to progressive massive osteolysis resulting in cortical bone loss, and leading to severe deformations and disability,<sup>[</sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>]</sup> whereas CA usually remains confined to the medullary cavity and does not progress. CA cysts are usually surrounded by a sclerotic rim, and bone lesions may present as osteosclerotic lesions, as observed in our fourth case (Case 4). By contrast, no bone formation occurs in GSD, even after the osteolytic process has stopped.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[38]</sup></xref> Some patients seem to present an intermediate form, like the case reported by Shivaram et al<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[29]</sup></xref> of severe late-onset CA of the proximal humerus, which continued to grow, complicated 5 years later by disseminated bony involvement, with the development of numerous pathological stress fractures that failed to heal, despite surgery and bisphosphonate treatment. However, this case was nevertheless classified as CA, particularly as follow-up for 15 years showed osteosclerotic conversion for many of the lesions.</p>

        <title>Pathophysiology of cystic angiomatosis</title>
        <p>The pathophysiology of CA and GSD remains poorly understood. Lymphatic vessels are not present in normal bones, but are found in the medullary and cortical regions of bones in patients with GSD<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[38]</sup></xref> and CA. Lymphangiogenesis&#x2014;the sprouting of new lymphatic vessels from preexisting vessels&#x2014;occurs in an uncontrolled manner in GSD, but this lymphatic abnormality is considered to be a malformation rather than a tumor.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[38]</sup></xref> Several prolymphangiogenic factors, either alone or in combination, can stimulate lymphangiogenesis in CA and GSD. Several members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family (from A to D) and the angiopoietin family (1 and 2) have already been implicated in this process. A lack of antilymphangiogenic factors (including TGF-beta and interferon-gamma) may also enhance the sprouting of lymphatic vessels in the bones.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[38]</sup></xref> A positive feedback loop between some bone cells (including mesenchymal cells) and new lymphatic vessels might account for the frequent restriction of lymphangiogenesis to the bone in CA and GSD, although extension to other tissues, such as the pleura, has also been reported in both conditions.</p>
        <p>The hypothesis that vascular channel proliferation in the bone marrow affects bone remodeling and causes bone destruction in GSD has been put forward by several different authors.<sup>[</sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref><sup>]</sup> Large numbers of pericyte/macrophage-like mononuclear cells with abundant acid phosphatase-positive lysosomal bodies are usually present, and these cells could drive lymphangiogenesis, either directly, or indirectly, by releasing VEGF (A, C&#x2013;D). However, mature osteoclasts are not always present in areas of bone resorption in GSD, particularly in stable lesions.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[38]</sup></xref> Thus, although some investigators have observed osteoclasts in osteolytic zones, many others have reported an absence of typical osteoclasts from some areas of bone resorption.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[38]</sup></xref> Other reports have stressed the lack of evidence for an increase in osteoblast activity in active GSD lesions, in which the disappearing bone is replaced by fibrovascular tissue rather than by newly formed woven repair bone. This lack of osteocyte and osteoblast synthetic activity is puzzling, particularly in the most active lesions of GSD, because the high concentrations of VEGF-A should promote an osteoblastic response by enhancing angiogenesis. These findings suggest that the factors produced by the pathologic lymphatic cells stimulate the differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors along the fibroblastic, rather than osteoblastic lineage in GSD. This appears less likely in CA, because a peripheral sclerotic rim is frequently observed and some lesions may even condense. Such a hypothesis would be consistent with the high levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) reported in the affected bones of some GSD patients<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[47]</sup></xref> (because fibroblasts produce large amounts of IL-6, and this cytokine enhances osteoclast activity), and the normal levels of IL-6 in CA patients.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[30]</sup></xref>
</p>
        <p>There is strong evidence to suggest that CA has a genetic basis. For example, 12 cases of diffuse CA have been identified in 4 generations of 1 family. The disease appeared to have an autosomal dominant distribution, with no skipped generations and an equal sex distribution.<sup>[</sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>]</sup> In sporadic cases of CA, mosaicism for a somatic mutation in bone marrow precursor cells has been put forward as an explanation, and similar mutations may also be involved in GSD.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[38]</sup></xref> Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from cell lines derived from affected tissues or from the affected tissue itself could be used in exome-sequencing experiments, to detect local genetic changes, either in lymphatic cells or in pericyte/macrophage-like mononuclear cells, which may differ slightly between CA and GSD. However, such an approach could face ethical limitations, because bone biopsy is no longer necessary for the diagnosis of CA, which is instead usually diagnosed on clinical and radiological grounds.<sup>[</sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Our findings for 4 patients, and a review of the clinical and imaging features of CA in previous cases confirmed that CA was a heterogeneous disorder with an unpredictable natural course. New pathophysiological findings are urgently required, particularly as no treatment has yet been shown to be effective at stabilizing cysts or promoting their regression. Further studies should focus on the cellular and molecular aspects of CA, which may be very similar to those of GSD, given the striking similarities between these 2 conditions, despite their different prognoses.</p>
