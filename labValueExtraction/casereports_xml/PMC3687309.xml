    <p content-type="flushleft">Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x3B1; is an effective treatment for Crohn disease. It is recommended as a second-line therapy in steroid-dependent or -refractory disease, although first-line treatment may improve chances of intestinal mucosal healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In the context of diabetes, TNF-&#x3B1; has been implicated in the development of insulin resistance during obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and in autoimmune destruction of pancreatic &#x3B2;-cells in an animal model of type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), and a recent study demonstrated some preservation of insulin secretion in children with new-onset type 1 diabetes upon TNF-&#x3B1; inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p>
    <p>Here, we report a case of a 29-year-old Caucasian man who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 27 years on the basis of rapid onset of hyperglycemia, a lean BMI of 22.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, signs of &#x3B2;-cell autoimmunity (autoantibodies to GAD 476 IU/mL [normal value &lt;10] and islet-cell autoantibodies 125 units/mL [normal value &lt;1.5]), and a negative family history of diabetes. Upon treatment with insulin glargine and insulin lispro, A1C levels decreased from 9.4% (79 mmol/mol) to 6.1% (43 mmol/mol) within 6 months. In parallel to the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, the patient reported intermittent feelings of abdominal fullness and subsequent diarrhea. Fecal calprotectin levels were found to be markedly elevated: up to 1,280.6 &#x3BC;g/g (normal value &lt;50 &#x3BC;g/g stool), and Crohn disease was histologically confirmed 9 months after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.</p>
    <p>To prevent worsening of diabetes upon steroid therapy and because of the putative role of TNF-&#x3B1; in &#x3B2;-cell demise, we decided to treat the patient with the TNF-&#x3B1; inhibitor infliximab. Infliximab (5 mg/kg body wt) was administered intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 6 and every 8 weeks thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). After the first dose of infliximab, 9 months after diagnosing type 1 diabetes, remission of Crohn disease was achieved as reflected by normalization of bowel movements and by fecal calprotectin levels that were below the normal range (&lt;50 &#x3BC;g/g stool) after the second dose of infliximab. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels decreased from 1.3 mg/L (normal value &lt;10) to &lt;0.3 mg/L after the first dose of infliximab was administered.</p>
    <p>Remission of Crohn disease was paralleled by an immediate and sustained 2.4-fold increase in insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>) and a progressive up to 6.9-fold decrease in insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>) as derived from measurements of glucose and C-peptide assessed during mixed-meal tests that were performed right before and after the initiation of infliximab therapy every 3&#x2013;4 months over a 1-year period. A1C remained &#x223C;6.0% (42 mmol/mol), while insulin lispro requirements per 10 g carbohydrate dropped from 0.8 to 0.5 units after initiation of infliximab treatment.</p>

    <p>Several mechanisms may explain the observed effects of TNF-&#x3B1; antagonism on glucose metabolism. Since the treatment with infliximab was initiated 9 month after the diagnosis of diabetes, at a time when the patient had a stable requirement of insulin and A1C was &#x223C;6%, a reversal due to &#x201C;honeymoon&#x201D; or glucotoxicity is unlikely. Thus, it is conceivable that insulin secretion may have improved as a direct result of the immunosuppressive effects on insulitis and enhanced insulin sensitivity may have alleviated the burden on the &#x3B2;-cells. Of note, it was not expected to see changes in insulin sensitivity in a patient with type 1 diabetes. However, in the case depicted herein, increased leakiness of the mucosal barrier for bacterial products or systemic inflammation due to Crohn disease may have promoted insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Independently of the underlying mechanisms, we propose that TNF-&#x3B1; inhibitors be considered a first-line treatment in patients with both type 1 diabetes and Crohn disease.</p>
