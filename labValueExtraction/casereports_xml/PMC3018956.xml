        <p>Urinary peritonitis (the uroperitoneum) is categorized as a difficult to diagnose clinical entity due to its poor manifestations.</p>
        <p>Vesical trauma following pelvis bone fracture is the most frequently involved in the uroperitoneum aetiology, followed by spontaneous vesical rupture 
and intraoperative iatrogenic lesions.</p>
        <p>One of the most important and constant signs that can occur is diffuse abdominal tension, without tenderness.</p>
        <p>The imagistic procedure that sets the diagnosis is retrograde cystography showing intraperitoneal urine effusion.</p>
        <p>Vesical rupture is a surgical emergency.</p>
        <p>The uroperitoneum is a particular type of peritonitis that has hidden and misleading symptoms which can delay the diagnosis long enough to endanger 
the patient's life.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The truth about urinary peritonitis (or uroperitoneum as surgeons call this clinical entity) is that it is &#x2013; restating the motto &#x2013; 
a &#x2018;peculiar&#x2019; peritonitis! We will try to explain in the following paragraphs what this peculiarity consists of. Simply defined as the 
presence of urine in the peritoneal space, the uroperitoneum conceals many characteristics although at first sight can be enclosed in the rich category 
of causes for secondary, let us say ordinary peritonitis (urinary aetiology peritonitis: rupture of high urinary pathways or of urinary bladder). 
It represents through its content and clinical manifestations a rarely encountered and problematic type of pathology. There are not few the times when we 
see in medical literature strange cases or let us call them less than usual cases, not only by being spectacular but by being difficult to diagnose. There 
are not few the times when we confront with situations in which the patient's state makes us think although laboratory findings are 
within &#x2018;loose normal limits&#x2019;!</p>
    <p>Without exaggerating, we believe that there are cases when many experienced surgeons can not tell for certain if they are facing an uroperitoneum. 
Without any doubt, the diagnosis of the uroperitoneum is a difficult one and requires clinical experience (if there is seen such a thing) or flair.</p>
    <p>We have to particularly mention that not long ago (the very reason behind this article) we encountered such a case. It wasn't the first time we 
had seen in our practice a patient with urinary peritonitis. A woman of 52 years of age, a farmer in the Focsani county (observation sheet no. 49104 
from 21.01.2008), presented to our hospital at one of the medical clinics then admitted directly in the ICU due to her altered general status and acute 
renal failure: oligo-anuria &#x2013; 300ml in 24 hrs, serum potassium of 7.7 mEq/l, creatinine of 8.5mg/dl etc., without any other symptoms or signs. 24 
hours later we were called for a &#x2018;collegial&#x2019; consult in order for us to insert an autostatic double JJ stent (the well known Cook catheter) or 
a nephrostoma, something?!. . . (She was anuric after all).</p>
    <p>We examined the patient taking into account more than biochemical lab values and CT images (dubitative interpretation). We noticed that she had 
diffuse abdominal tension and vague hypogastrium pain. Retrograde cystography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) showed the flow of 
contrast substance in the peritoneal space. To be noted that we made this investigation not due to the suspicion of uroperitoneum but because of our 
previous experience, years ago, of a somewhat similar case: a 35 year old autistic man, sheared between two carriages of a circulating tram, without 
pelvis fracture but with urinary  bladder rupture and consequent uroperitoneum.</p>

    </fig>
    <p>We intervened surgically through an anterior abdominal incision and intraoperatively, an old an important vesical lesion was seen, on a bladder that 
looked &#x2018;withered&#x2019;, well fixed on an intestinal loop, which explained the almost missing symptoms. Without bringing new information in 
addition to the ones already reported in literature, we will note in the following, a few aspects on urinary peritonitis, with an intent of more 
than attracting attention towards this type of pathology</p>
    <p>Urine may get between intestinal loops by effraction through one of the urinary tract organs and the most frequently involved is the urinary 
bladder, through the rupture of its peritoneal side. Theoretically, the uroperitoneum can appear also through renal or urethral trauma but, considering 
their retroperitoneal location, causing agents must have a more complex and aggressive mechanism. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>)</p>

      <graphic xlink:href="JMedLife-01-66-g002"/>
    </fig>
    <p>As a consequence, urinary bladder ruptures can be spontaneous, traumatic or iatrogenic.Spontaneous ruptures presume in principle the existence of a 
thin vesical wall, an immunosuppressant status or a lack in body proteins, such as consumption diseases. Quite a few at a first glance, these 
pathological situations which lead to the spontaneous effraction of the bladder make us think that they are least probable to be juxtaposed in order to 
make the optimal frame that causes urinary peritonitis. Nevertheless, it happens!</p>
    <p>Most frequent vesical ruptures appear in situations like chronic alcohol intakes (drunk man's bladder) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
], immunosuppression, cirrhosis, diabetes, tuberculosis, scarred or tumoral bladders, when there are large vesical diverticula or chronic vesical 
obstacles with thin vesical wall. The question of a determining factor of vesical rupture was raised, in spite of the mentioned associated pathology. 
Most of the times there is a traumatic mechanism involved, brought to light by a very detailed history but there are cases in which no trauma can be 
traced.</p>
    <p>Vesical ruptures are induced mainly by action of the injury agent directly on the inferior abdomen. This determines a great and sudden pressure on 
the abdominal wall which spreads to the bladder, projects itself on the posterior wall of the pelvis and due to its resistance and comes back towards 
the bladder (anterior), giving it a counter blow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>].</p>
    <p>To this mechanism, a series of favourable conditions which may contribute to the extent of the lesions can be variably added.</p>
    <p>The amount of urine present inside the bladder at the moment of injury plays an important part. If the bladder is empty, it can be torn only through 
direct impact of the trauma agent on its walls because of its deep location in the pelvis and its protection by pelvic bones. Full bladder comes out of 
that protection and becomes an intraperitoneal organ. Vesical wall grows thinner in proportion with the quantity of urine and the flexibility of its 
muscular fibres decreases. Anatomical areas with least resistance are the superior and posterior walls.</p>
    <p>Vesical pathologies which determine a decline in wall strength (inflammatory, tumoral, scaring processes) favour surprisingly serious lesions 
following minor traumas.</p>
    <p>Neurological lesions of vesical wall lower its ability of distension and also muscle tone and consequently allow an accumulation of a great amount 
of urine. It is the case of neurogenic bladder patients. </p>
    <p>Last but not least, vesical ruptures can be accidentally produced during surgery of the pelvic area or during endoscopy procedures when, due to 
vesical wall lesion, the washing endovesical fluid effuses in the peritoneal cavity and produces an iatrogenic uroperitoneum (the patient's 
abdomen grows &#x2018;second by second&#x2019;).</p>
    <sec sec-type="Physiopathology" id="sec1-1">
      <title>Physiopathology</title>
      <p>The intimate substratum of urinary peritonitis symptoms is common to every peritonitis but noting that it depends greatly with the quantity and quality 
of urine, if we're allowed to say it like this. When a sterile urine effuses, the symptoms are minimal, hidden and become clinically obvious when 
this urine becomes infected. In the same way, the clinical suffering and the expressed symptoms can be seen when urine is infected per primam.</p>
      <p>Many local defence mechanisms come to aid against infection and other immune as well. Mechanical ones belong to the structural anatomy and to 
different characteristics of the peritoneum. Inside the immune mechanisms are cellular components, serum ones, unspecific immunity and the complement 
system.</p>
      <p>Confinement of infection is realised through direct absorption of bacteria in the lymphatic system, their fagocytosis and formation of 
intraperitoneal abscesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. The systemic response to bacterial 
aggression lies in the release of physiological messengers of inflammation: cytokines (TNF alpha, IL&#x2013;1, IL&#x2013;6, interferon, etc) and 
cellular effectors (neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells). These activated cellular effectors lead to the synthesis and secretion of 
new cytokines and secondary inflammation mediators (prostaglandins, leucotriens, tromboxans, trombocyte activating factor etc) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>Loss of local control is clinically identified with SIRS &#x2013;systemic inflammatory response syndrome &#x2013; which subsequently evolves toward 
MODS &#x2013;multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, which will not be detailed here. Most times, newly diagnosed uroperitoneum cases are comprised in the 
above mentioned situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>Finally, in serious and delayed treatment cases, multiple organ dysfunction becomes a sombre entity called CHAOS (Cardiovascular shock, 
Homeostasis, Apoptosis, Organ dysfunction, immune Suppression), with minimal chances of survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="Clinical Manifestations" id="sec1-2">
      <title>Clinical Manifestations</title>
      <p>Symptoms of vesical trauma and namely of urinary peritonitis are not specific.</p>
      <p>In the case of a pathological bladder, a surprising discordance may appear between the low force of the injury agent and the emergence of vesical 
lesions (a minor trauma may determine lesions of maximum gravity). Some other times, the tear of vesical wall is distanced from the moment of the 
accident, representing the so-called &#x2018;two&#x2013;stage vesical rupture&#x2019; (a temporary obstruction of the lesion with omentum or intestinal loops 
which determines tardy solution of continuity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>].</p>
      <p>The presence of sterile urine in the peritoneal space can be tolerated for many days, with faded, inconclusive local symptoms. In this 
situation, alteration in general wellbeing and imbalance of electrolytes are more obvious etc. Perforations and ruptures of urinary bladder usually begin 
with a violent pain, located in the pelvis or the perineum and are relatively constantly accompanied by vesical and rectal tenesmes. If urine 
emission continues to be spontaneous, it is accompanied by polakiuria, dysuria, haematuria, painful urine emission which is also weak, discontinuous and 
with a sensation of incomplete evacuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. In principle, the 
manifestations of uroperitoneum can be organised into the following symptoms and signs, one or two being present in common practice, thus making 
diagnosis difficult  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]:</p>

in 90% of cases), previous endoscopy manoeuvres and their juxtaposed pathology and presence of more than one of the above mentioned signs.</p>

      <p>In a book, the only one about this subject published in Romania and also a beginning of trade cornerstone for experienced surgeons 
&#x2013; &#x2018;Surgical exploration of abdomen&#x2019; by Dr. Dan Gerota (Medical Publishing House 1969, first edition, page 70, same publishing house 
1987, second edition) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] &#x2013; the unsurpassed surgeon and teacher pointed out:
&#x2018;Other effusions (peritoneal effusion, authors note) are rarely encountered and more difficult to diagnose, especially urine, when mixed with blood 
or in low quantity (the case of urether lesions). Even in the case of a vesical lesion, if empty during trauma, in the case of little continuity fluid, 
with outlet or situated in an extraperitoneal area, we encounter the same difficulties.&#x2019;</p>

      <p>Information offered by ultrasound and imaging explorations are doubtful and most often the interpretation offered by our specialist colleague is 
charged with a high, subjective and lacking involvement dose (caused for example by &#x2018;the presence of air in between loops, numerous 
artefacts&#x2019; and so on). In the case that we presented their help was minimal at most.</p>
      <p>Urethral cystoscopy is not recommended because the risk of aggravating the lesions is high (washing fluid will effuse in the peritoneum and become 
an additional factor of infection). If the manoeuvre is done nonetheless, the actual lesion, where intestinal loops or parts of the epiploon enter, can 
be seen inside the bladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p>

    <sec sec-type="Treatment" id="sec1-4">
      <title>Treatment</title>
      <p>The treatment of vesical ruptures and uroperitoneum is primarily surgical, of outmost urgency and is made of a median abdominal incision 
(preferably xifo&#x2013;pubian for a wider approach) through which the entire abdominal cavity and pelvis are explored. The vesical lesion is 
sutured, eventually in double layer with the excision of anfractuous vesical margins and the bladder is drained efficiently in order to ensure integrity 
of the future suture. An inspection of the entire cavity is done, false membranes are cleaned if present, the peritoneum is washed with a dextrane or 
saline solution and drained with one or more drainage canules, correctly placed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8
</xref>].</p>
      <p>When the agent of injury has a big enough force and determines an almost complete destruction of the bladder, enlargement enteral cytoplasties can be 
done.</p>
      <p>Supportive postoperative treatment plays a very important part. Antibiotics must have a large spectrum, eventually be against anaerobes and in close 
to maximum dose. Gastric protection (antiacids to prevent stress ulcers) is imposed along with electrolyte and acid&#x2013;base balance, anticoagulants 
to avoid disseminated intravascular coagulation, amino acids, human albumin or proteins to strengthen the immune system.</p>
      <p>This article does not follow known and asked for by the editor's author recommendations which is to say it will not conclude with anything.</p>
      <p>We wrote it because we wished to remind that the uroperitoneum is a type of peritonitis that has hidden manifestations which can greatly delay diagnosis 
so that patient's life is jeopardised.Clinical signs at presentation are most often few and common, one of which is muscle contraction 
without tenderness in the absence of subumbilical trauma.</p>
      <p>As it is often said, to make a good diagnosis, one must think of it! From here on to the motto: &#x2018;Qui bene diagnoscit, bene curat!&#x2019; only 
one step must be taken&#x2026;</p>
