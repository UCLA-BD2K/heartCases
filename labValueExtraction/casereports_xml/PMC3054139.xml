        <p>A rare case of bilateral renal cortical necrosis (BRCN) diagnosed only by the characteristic and specific findings of a contrast-enhanced CT scan during the acute initial phase of the disease is presented in this paper. Furthermore, twenty-eight patients of BRCN in the world literatures in English after 1980 were analyzed to investigate the changes in its clinical features over the past 15 years in comparison with the reported data before 1980 from two large centers in France (F) and India (I). Obstetric causes decreased from 68% (F) and 71% (I) before 1980 to 28% after 1980, whereas nonobstetric causes increased from 32% (F) and 29% (I) to 72% after 1980. Among the nonobstetric causes of BRCN, the leading causes were sepsis in 4 out of 12 patients (F) and snake bite in 6 out of 14 patients (I) before 1980, but, in contrast, drugs in 4 out of 21 patients after 1980. As a definite diagnostic procedure for BRCN, 95 to 100% before 1980 but 86% after 1980 performed renal biopsy, of which renal biopsy while living was done in only 42% (F) and 16% (I) before 1980 and 67% after 1980. None showed renal calcification in abdominal X-ray, and only 25% (3/12) had nonspecific echo findings in renal ultrasonography, whereas the high sensitivity for BRCN was noted in renal arteriography in 100% (6/6) and contrast-enhanced CT scan in 88% (7/8). The mortality of BRCN decreased from 55% (F) and 86% (I) before 1980 to 36% after 1980. This review of BRCN, in conclusion, revealed the distinctive changes over the past 15 years in the etiology with a higher incidence of non-obstetric causes than obstetric ones, diagnostic procedures with less dependence on renal biopsy but new trials of non-invasive radioimagings including CT scan and even MRI, and a further declining mortality rate.</p>
