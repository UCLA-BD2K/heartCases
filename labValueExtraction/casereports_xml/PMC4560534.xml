      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nails caused, in 80 to 90% of cases, by the
dermatophytes Trichophyton rubrum and <italic>Trichophyton mentagrophytes</italic>,
affecting from 10 to 30% of the global population.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Clinically, there are five different modalities: distal and
lateral subungual onychomycosis, proximal subungual onychomycosis, superficial
onychomycosis, endonyx onychomycosis and mixed onychomycosis.<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The most used conventional treatments include oral (OAF) and topical (TAF) antifungals.
Despite the numerous antifungal medications available in the market, the cure rate is
low, with high rates of relapse after treatment.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In addition, due to the
peculiarities of the ungual system and speed of fungal reproduction, oral antifungals
may require a long treatment, which would increase costs for the patient, besides
enhancing the possibility of adverse effects.<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Therefore, there is a growing need to seek a more efficient method that may diminish
relapses and have a smaller chance of adverse effects.<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In this context, some non conventional treatments for
onychomycosis, like laser and photodynamic therapy, have shown effectiveness in
combating this infection.<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The objective of this study was to present to patients with a recurring clinical picture
a topical therapy for the treatment of onychomycosis, more effective and faster than
conventional methods, using fractional co<sub>2</sub> laser 10.600nm associated with
photodynamic therapy in the same session.</p>

      <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
      <p>This is a study that had as object cases selected from our Outpatient Hair and Nails
Clinic, in the period between August and October 2012, which were clinically followed-up
for one year after the last session. All of the patients presented alterations in the
nail plate clinically suggestive of onychomycosis and underwent mycological examination
by culture and microcultivation to determine the etiologic agents at the Special
Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology of the Mycology Department. These examinations were
carried out at three occasions: before the sessions, 30 days after the second session
and 1 year after the second session. Prior to the beginning of the study the patients
were oriented not to use any TAF or OAF for one month before the collection date. None
of the patients used any TAF or OAF during the follow-up period of the study.</p>
      <p>The inclusion criteria of the study were: patients who had tried previous treatment with
TAF or OAF without therapeutic success and with recurrence of the clinical picture,
patients with onychomycosis of long progression or patients with chronic diseases in
whom the long-term use of OAF would have a chance of causing systemic alterations. Those
patients with collagenoses and patients with photosensitive disease who presented
onychomycosis by nondermatophyte agents in the prior examination were excluded.</p>
      <p>Two sessions were conducted with each study patient, with a 60-day interval between
them. The sessions were carried out with fractional CO2 laser 10.600nm, 3rd overlap,
1.600mJ energy and 0.6mm density between the points over the affected nail areas.
Subsequently methyl aminolevulinate hydrochloride 16% was applied over the area and the
product remained under occlusion by opaque material for 2 hours. Then Light-Emitting
Diode (LED) for photodynamic therapy was applied for 15 minutes. Both sessions were
carried out in the same manner. None of the patients used any OAF or TAF during
follow-up.</p>
      <p>In order to conduct the case study the patients were evaluated at moment zero, before
the sessions began, for mycological test and digital photograph; at moment one, 30 days
after the second session, for mycological test; and at a late moment, one year after the
second session, for mycological test and digital photograph. The nails were divided into
four quadrants with the back of fingers in a non anatomic position (medial distal nail
plate, lateral distal nail plate, medial proximal nail plate and lateral proximal nail
plate) through a vertical imaginary line and another horizontal imaginary line at the
mean point of each side of the plate. After this division, the number of clinically
involved and not involved quadrants was determined (1 quadrant, 2 quadrants, 3 quadrants
and 4 quadrants) before and after therapy (late moment) by digital photography. The
statistical analysis of this correlated paired sample was done with the Microsoft Excel
program through McNemar test with continuity correction, significance level 5% (alpha
level = 0.05 for rejection of the null hypothesis) and 1 degree of freedom. The number
of failures is considered as "a", because it goes from an absence of disease to a
presence of disease, and "d" is the number of successes, because it goes from a presence
to an absence of disease, according to the formula below:</p>
      <p>Q2 = ( |a-d| - 1)2 / a+d</p>
      <p>The clinical cure is based on the diminution of the number of quadrants without clinical
lesion after 1 year of follow-up. The mycological cure was determined by the mycological
test results, using culture and microcultivation at moment one and late moment.</p>
      <p>The Degree of Satisfaction of the patients was investigated by questionnaire with scores
from 0 to 4, with the following parameters: 0 - dissatisfied, as the condition worsened;
1 - dissatisfied, as nothing changed; 2 - satisfied, but would like more; and 3 - fully
satisfied. The questionnaire was applied after one year of follow-up. Data analysis was
carried out using simple percentages.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="results">
      <title>RESULTS</title>
      <p>The epidemiological profile of this case study had seven patients, four male and three
female, with ages varying between 41 and 65 years. All of the patients had undergone
previous therapy, both topical and systemic, with recurrence and treatment failure. The
time of progression of the disease varied from 1 to 12 years, with median of 10 years
before the patient looked for another type of treatment. None of them had used
technology in the approach to onychomycosis treatment.</p>
      <p>Of the seven nail lesion scrapings, after culture and microcultivation evaluations, six
presented <italic>Trichophyton rubrum</italic> and one Epidermophyton floccosum as
etiologic agents. After identification of the species, two sessions of fractional CO2
laser 10.600nm were performed on the affected nail, followed by Photodynamic Therapy,
with a 60-day interval between them.</p>
      <p>The total of quadrants analyzed was 28, as each of the seven nail plates were divided
into four, as described in the methodology. The analysis of the digital photographs with
the description of the number of affected and not affected quadrants before and one year
after the last session are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">table 1</xref>. Of
the 19 affected quadrants, 15 presented clinical therapeutic success ("d") and of the 9
quadrants not affected, none presented therapeutic failure ("a"). McNemar Test with
continuity correction for clinical cure was 13.06, with p = 0.00005. The digital
photographs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">figures 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">7</xref>.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Despite the numerous antifungal medications available for onychomycosis therapy, the
cure rate is low, with high relapse rates after treatment.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Light therapy
was shown to be a promising treatment for this nosology for its ability to act in a
small area of the affected region, which would limit the systemic adverse effects. In
addition, the high concentration of energy released by means of this technique allows
deeper penetration into the nail plate, eradicating all fungal residues.<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser 10.600nm immediately destroys, at the moment of
application, the area affected by fungi, allowing the elimination of the damaged nail
and a deeper penetration of the methyl aminolevulinate hydrochloride 16% to optimize the
action of light in photodynamic therapy.<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This photochemical reaction is able to selectively destroy a tissue.
This methodology represents a complex system that requires three factors to interact
concomitantly: a photosensitizer, such as the 5-aminolevulinic acid; a light source and
oxygen.<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In cases that involve superficial cutaneous fungal
infections, many in vitro studies demonstrated, in culture media, the effectiveness of
photodynamic therapy to combat the <italic>Trichophyton rubrum</italic>.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In this study, the mycological cure was achieved in all of the patients at two distinct
moments, with statistically significant outcomes (p&lt;0.005), without observing any
relapse of the infection in the follow-up period. These results are superior to those
already observed after treatment with conventional antifungals, when the cure rate is
low, with high relapse rates after treatment.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, it should be
emphasized that negative mycological tests may not prove that healing was achieved,
since over 40% of cases may be false negatives. An example of this may be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">figure 2</xref>, which presented persistent chromonychia.
Together with this mycological cure is associated the absence of onycholysis relapse and
nail pain one year after the end of treatment. In addition to this mycological cure, the
improved clinical aspect was also statistically significant, with p&lt;0.005 when each
of the 28 quadrants is compared. However, when the entire nail plate is compared before
and after the treatment, only 43% presented total lightening of lesions. This was a
selection bias of the study, as the patients included were those with a recurrent
clinical picture or of long progression, that is, onychomycosis pictures more resistant
to traditional therapy. In any case, the patients presented favorable outcomes after 12
months of follow-up, with no need for topical or systemic antifungal therapy for any of
the patients during this follow-up period, reaching the maximum degree of satisfaction
in 72% of the cases. In the long term, this reflects in a decreased risk of adverse
effects for the patients, contrary to what is observed in treatment with oral
antifungals.<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>

      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>Our conclusion is that the use of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser 10.600nm associated
with photodynamic therapy may be effective in the treatment of recurrent onychomycosis
of difficult treatment, as well as diminish the risk for systemic lesions that may be
triggered with prolonged use of oral antifungals. However, further studies and longer
follow-up are necessary to corroborate our observation.</p>
      <p>We consider this emerging treatment important not only as an individual therapy, but
mainly as combined therapy, since there was clinical improvement that could be increased
by association with other topical or systemic antifungal therapies.</p>
