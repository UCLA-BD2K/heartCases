        <p>Damage control surgery is a feasible and successful approach for the management

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Damage control or abbreviated laparotomy is the current alternative treatment for
exsanguinating patients who have developed the triad of hypothermia, coagulopathy,
and acidosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Although this staged approach previously has been
used in pediatric patients with blunt abdominal injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], this method also can be used safely
for other traumatic and non-traumatic causes of intra-abdominal bleeding
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. The use of umbilical
catheters has become a common procedure in neonatal intensive care units around the
world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. However, these
catheters have associated complications, including vascular and liver injuries
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Although rare, these injuries carry a significant rate of
morbidity and mortality due to significant blood loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. We present a newborn patient with hepatic
laceration and intra-abdominal hemorrhage secondary to an umbilical catheter-related
injury.</p>

      <title>Case Presentation</title>
      <p>This is a 4-day-old girl weighing 900 grams who was one of triplets born at 28-weeks
gestation. Immediately after birth, an umbilical artery catheter (UAC) and umbilical
vein catheter (UVC) were placed. The UVC had to be repositioned after an initial
unsuccessful attempt at placement. On day-of-life 3, she developed
hyperbilirrubinemia, requiring an exchange transfusion. During the course of her
exchange transfusion, she became pale, and her hematocrit (Hct) was dropped from 38
percent to 31 percent. After the transfusion was stopped, the patient became
hemodynamically unstable. A repeat Hct was 10 percent, and an ultrasound confirmed
the presence of a hepatic hematoma as well as a large amount of free fluid. The
patient was resuscitated, the UVC was removed, and the patient was transferred to
our institution, where the pediatric surgery team was consulted.</p>
      <p>On physical examination, her abdomen was extremely distended and bluish in color.
Despite several transfusions, the Hct was only 20 percent. The patient was taken
emergently to the operating room for evidence of ongoing intra-abdominal hemorrhage.
The abdomen was explored through an upper abdominal transverse incision. Upon entry
into the abdomen, massive hemoperitoneum was found. Initial exploration of the upper
abdomen revealed a two-centimeter tear in the liver capsule located at the dome of
the right lobe. Associated with this capsular tear was an underlying cavity with
dark debris and fibrinous material within it, suggestive of ruptured subcapsular
hematoma. Pressure was held at the site with a surgical sponge, and the remainder of
the abdomen was inspected. The hemoperitoneum was evacuated (approximately 50 ml of
blood), and the abdomen irrigated. No other injuries were found. The liver was again
inspected, and ongoing bleeding was noted. At this time, the patient had a rectal
temperature of 35.8C and was severely acidotic (arterial pH: 7.15, PCO2: 23).
Therefore, the area of the laceration was packed with Surgicel&#xAE; (ETHICON, INC.,
West Somerville, NJ) and surgical sponges, and the decision was made to terminate
the surgery. A piece of silastic sheeting was inserted below the abdominal fascia.
The wound was packed open with sponges, a drain was placed over the sponges, and the
entire wound was covered by an occlusive dressing. The patient was taken back to the
newborn special care unit (NBSCU) for aggressive resuscitation with the plan to
return to the operating room for re-exploration after correction of the patient&#x2019;s
acidosis, coagulopathy and hypothermia. On post-operative day (POD) 2, the patient
was taken for re-exploration. The packing was removed, and the abdomen was copiously
irrigated and inspected for hemostasis. A small amount of oozing from the dome of
the liver was noted and was packed with new Surgicel&#xAE;. After observing for
several minutes, no new bleeding occurred and the abdomen was closed. The patient
did well post-operatively, without further hepatic bleeding. Due to her prematurity,
she remained hospitalized but was ultimately discharged home on POD 101.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Damage control surgery for severe intra-abdominal hemorrhage has been proven to be a
safe alternative for adult and pediatric patients with exsanguinating hemorrhage
with the triad of hypothermia, coagulopathy, and acidosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. The goal of the initial approach is to control bleeding by
tamponade in order to have time to correct this lethal triad. After replacement of
clotting factors, rewarming, and correction of the acidosis, a second look procedure
is performed to remove packing and address any ongoing bleeding. The decision for a
staged operative strategy for unstable patients requires a thorough understanding of
the pathophysiologic consequences of this triad.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge, this is the first report of successful use of damage control
surgery in a premature infant. The etiology of the bleeding, an umbilical
catheter-related injury, may be unique to this population, but the techniques
employed should be included in the surgeon&#x2019;s armamentarium for any hemodynamically
unstable patient with intra-abdominal hemorrhage regardless of age or size. We
conclude that damage control surgery is a feasible technique in patients as small as
premature infants, and it should be considered for the management of intra-abdominal
exsanguinating hemorrhage regardless of the etiology.</p>
