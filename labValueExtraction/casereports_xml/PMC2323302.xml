          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Male pseudohermaphroditism, or Leydig cell hypoplasia (LCH), is an autosomal recessive disorder in individuals with a 46,XY karyotype, characterized by a predominantly female phenotype, a blind-ending vagina, absence of breast development, primary amenorrhea, and the presence of testicular structures. It is caused by mutations in the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor gene (<italic>LHCGR</italic>), which impair either LH/CG binding or signal transduction. However, molecular analysis has revealed that the <italic>LHCGR</italic> is apparently normal in about 50% of patients with the full clinical phenotype of LCH. We therefore searched the <italic>LHCGR</italic> for novel genomic elements causative for LCH.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="st2">
          <title>Methods and Findings</title>
          <p>In the present study we have identified a novel, primate-specific bona fide exon (exon 6A) within the <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene. It displays composite characteristics of an internal/terminal exon and possesses stop codons triggering nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in <italic>LHCGR</italic>. Transcripts including exon 6A are physiologically highly expressed in human testes and granulosa cells, and result in an intracellular, truncated LHCGR protein of 209 amino acids. We sequenced exon 6A in 16 patients with unexplained LCH and detected mutations in three patients. Functional studies revealed a dramatic increase in the expression of the mutated internal exon 6A transcripts, indicating aberrant NMD. These altered ratios of <italic>LHCGR</italic> transcripts result in the generation of predominantly nonfunctional LHCGR isoforms, thereby preventing proper expression and functioning.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>The identification and characterization of this novel exon not only identifies a new regulatory element within the genomic organization of <italic>LHCGR</italic>, but also points toward a complex network of receptor regulation, including events at the transcriptional level. These findings add to the molecular diagnostic tools for LCH and extend our understanding of the endocrine regulation of sexual differentiation.</p>

        <title>Editors' Summary</title>
        <sec id="sb1a">
          <title>Background.</title>
          <p>A person's sex is determined by their complement of X and Y (sex) chromosomes. Someone who has two X chromosomes is genetically female and usually has ovaries and female external sex organs. Someone who has an X and a Y chromosome is genetically male and has testes and male external sex organs. Sometimes, though, the development of the reproductive organs proceeds abnormally, resulting in a person with an &#x201C;intersex&#x201D; condition whose chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes), and external sex organs do not correspond. Leydig cell hypoplasia (LCH; also called male pseudohermaphroditism or a disorder of sex development) is an XY female intersex condition. People with this inherited condition develop testes but also have a vagina (which is not connected to a womb), and they do not develop breasts or have periods. This mixture of sexual characteristics arises because the Leydig cells in the testes are underdeveloped. Leydig cells normally secrete testosterone, the hormone that promotes the development and maintenance of male sex characteristics. Before birth, chorionic gonadotropin (CG; a hormone made by the placenta) stimulates Leydig cell development and testosterone production; after birth, luteinizing hormone (LH), which is made by the pituitary gland, stimulates testosterone production. Both hormones bind to the LH/CG receptor, a protein on the surface of Leydig cells. In LCH, this receptor either does not bind CG and LH or fails to tell the Leydig cells to make testosterone.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1b">
          <title>Why Was This Study Done?</title>
          <p>The gene that encodes the LH/CG receptor is called <italic>LHCGR</italic>. Several mutations (genetic changes) that inactivate the LC/CG receptor have been identified in people with LCH. However, the <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene is apparently normal in 50% of people with this intersex condition. In this study, the researchers examine the <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene in detail to try to find the underlying genetic defect in these individuals.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1c">
          <title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title>
          <p>The researchers used several molecular biology techniques to identify a new exon&#x2014;exon 6A&#x2014;within the human <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene. (Exons are DNA sequences that contain the information for making proteins; introns are DNA sequences that interrupt the coding sequence of a gene. Both introns and exons are transcribed into messenger RNA [mRNA] and the exons are then &#x201C;spliced&#x201D; together to make the mature mRNA, which is translated into protein.) The researchers identify several differently spliced <italic>LHCGR</italic> mRNA transcripts that contain exon 6A&#x2014;a terminal exon 6A mRNA that contains exons 1&#x2013;6 and exon 6A, and two internal exon 6A mRNAs that also contain exons 7&#x2013;11. The researchers report that human testes express high levels of the terminal exon 6A transcript, which is translated into a short version of LHCGR protein that remains within the cell (full-length LHCGR moves to the cell surface). By contrast, testes contain low levels of the internal exon 6A mRNAs. This is because exon 6A contains two premature stop codons (DNA sequences that mark the end of a protein), which trigger &#x201C;nonsense-mediated decay&#x201D; (NMD), a cellular surveillance mechanism that regulates protein synthesis by degrading mRNAs that contain internal stop codons. When the researchers screened 16 people with LCH but without known mutations in the <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene, three had mutations in exon 6A. Laboratory experiments show that these mutations greatly increased the amounts of the internal exon 6A transcripts present in cells and interfered with the cells' normal response to chorionic gonadotropin.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1d">
          <title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title>
          <p>These findings identify a new, functional exon in the <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene and show that mutations in this exon cause some cases of LCH. This is the first time that a human disease has been associated with mutations in an exon that is a target for NMD. In addition, these findings provide important insights into how the LHCGR is regulated. The researchers speculate that a complex network that involves the exon 6A-containing transcripts and NMD normally tightly regulates the production of functional LHCGR already at the transcriptional level. When mutations are present in exon 6A, they suggest, NMD is the predominant pathway for all the exon 6A-containing transcripts, thereby drastically decreasing the amount of functional LHCGR.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The gonadotropic hormones luteinizing hormone (LH) and chorionic gonadotropin (CG) play an essential role in male sexual differentiation. The action of both hormones is mediated by the LH/CG receptor (LHCGR), a G protein-coupled receptor, expressed in Leydig, granulosa-lutein, and theca cells. The human <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene (NCBI GeneID 3973; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) consists of 11 exons and ten introns, and spans 67 kbp on Chromosome 2 p21. Ten of the 11 exons encode the extracellular domain, while exon 11 encodes the seven-transmembrane and intracellular domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b001">1</xref>]. Several inactivating <italic>LHCGR</italic> mutations have been described in patients with 46,XY disorder of sex development (46,XY DSD) due to Leydig cell hypoplasia (LCH), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a predominantly female phenotype with a blind-ending vagina, absence of breast development, and primary amenorrhea and the presence of testicular structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b002">2</xref>]. However, in a substantial number of patients (50%) with the classical symptoms of LCH, no mutations of the <italic>LHCGR</italic> are found (unpublished data) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b004">4</xref>]. This finding raises the hypothesis that genomic defects in other genes or in <italic>LHCGR</italic> regions not considered so far may cause LCH. In this study we therefore searched the <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene for novel genomic elements in which genetic alterations could lead to LCH.</p>

          <p>Sixteen patients with complete LH resistance (male pseudohermaphroditism) due to LCH type 1 gave written informed consent to participate in the study. All patients had karyotype 46,XY, a blind-ending vagina, no breast development, and testicular structures in the abdomen and displayed the full phenotype of LCH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b004">4</xref>].

          <title>Case reports.</title>
          <p>A 20-year-old Turkish woman was referred to the gynecologist because of primary amenorrhea. She was the first daughter of a sibship of three children from consanguineous parents. She presented with a lack of breast development, normal pubic and axillary hair, blind-ending vagina (4 cm), and normal labia majora and minora. No clitoris hypertrophy was seen. She was obese (122 kg, 173 cm). Testes were palpable in the inguinal regions, but no m&#xFC;llerian derivatives were found by ultrasound. Karyotyping was performed and revealed a 46,XY karyotype. Hormone analysis showed very low serum testosterone levels (0.1 nmol/l), which could be not stimulated by treatment with 7,500 IU of hCG (maximal testosterone levels, 0.1 nmol/l). Serum levels of LH and FSH were elevated (LH 15.8 IU/l, FSH 13.6 IU/l) and responsive to stimulation with 100 &#x3BC;g of GnRH (LH 69.8 IU/l, FSH 20.1 IU/l).</p>
          <p>At the age of 26 y her sister, younger by 6 y, was referred to the Department of Endocrinology of the University of Essen also because of primary amenorrhea. She presented with the same phenotype as her older sister: 46,XY karyotype, blind-ending vagina (6 cm), inguinal gonads, obesity (126 kg, 176 cm), low estradiol level (21 pg/ml), low testosterone level (0.06 nmol/l, increasing to 1.9 nmol/l after 7,500 IU of hCG), elevated gonadotropin level (LH 24.3 IU/l, FSH 20.1 IU/l) responsive to 100 &#x3BC;g of GnRH (LH 98.0 IU/l, FSH 29.6 IU/l). Gonadectomy was performed and histological evaluation revealed complete Sertoli cell&#x2013;only syndrome with thickened tubule walls and focally disorganized tubules. Leydig cells appeared immature and their number was not evidently changed when compared to normal testes. In both affected sisters the previously performed genetic analysis of the <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene did not give any hint of mutations or other genetic alterations in other candidate genes.</p>
          <p>A third patient was analyzed for mutations in the <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene at the age of 21 mo. She was born to unrelated parents and presented a female phenotype with labial synechia. Gonads were palpable in both labia majora and a karyotype 46,XY was found. Postnatal testosterone levels were low and the girl was gonadectomized at the age of 2 mo. Histology showed fibrotic testis tissue. A heterozygous mutation leading to a Thr461Ile substitution in exon 11 of the <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene, resulting in complete inactivation, was found.</p>

        <p>Analysis of exon 6A was performed using the exon trapping system (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Plasmid constructs were generated by amplification of a DNA fragment from human genomic DNA using the specific primers Ex6a 150 fw (forward) 5&#x2032;-CGCTCGAGCCTGCCCTCCTCGGCCTCCCAAAG-3&#x2032; and <italic>LHCGR</italic> Ex6a 150 rev (reverse) 5&#x2032;-CGCGGATCCCTTTATAAGCAGCCGGTAGAGCTG-3&#x2032; containing the restriction site Xho1 within the forward primer or BamH1 for the reverse primer. The fragment was amplified using the following thermocycler conditions: 94 &#xB0;C for 50 s, 64 &#xB0;C for 50 s, 72 &#xB0;C for 90 s for 35 cycles. The obtained amplicon was restricted by Xho1 and BamH1 and cloned into the pSPL3 vector. Sequence fidelity was confirmed by DNA sequencing.</p>

        <title><italic>LHCGR</italic> Minigene Constructs</title>
        <p>The genomic region encompassing exon 6, exon 6A, and exon 7, with a total length of 9,534 bp, was amplified from genomic DNA of one patient with the A557C mutation and one male individual lacking the mutation using the Expand Long PCR kit by Roche (Mannheim, Germany). The following two primers and manufacturer-recommended thermocycler conditions were used: exon 6 for (forward) 5&#x2032;-GTGATAACTTACACATAACCACCATACCAGG-3&#x2032; and exon 7 rev (reverse) 5&#x2032;-GTCAGTGTCGTCCCATTGAATGCATGAC-3&#x2032;). The obtained amplicons were cloned into the pTarget expression plasmid (Promega, Germany) and sequence fidelity was confirmed by DNA sequencing.</p>
        <p>These constructs were further modified for signal transduction studies. To mimic the in vivo situation as close as possible we engineered a construct consisting of <italic>LHCGR</italic> cDNA and embedding the genomic intron 6 with exon 6A. To reduce the length of the intron to a manageable size the minigene constructs with the genomic region encompassing intron 6 from both wild-type and A557C <italic>LHCGR</italic> were digested with EcoRV, 6,209 bp were removed from the intronic region 3&#x2032; of exon 6A, and the remaining parts were re-ligated. A functional analysis of the shortened constructs revealed a similar splicing pattern to the full-length construct. Thereafter, a three-step cloning strategy was employed. In the first step cDNA from exons 1&#x2013;6 was amplified and joined to the 5&#x2032; end of the shortened minigene construct by overlapping PCR, yielding a product containing exons 1&#x2013;6, shortened intron 6, and exon 7; this product was subsequently cloned into the pTarget vector. In the second step, the 3&#x2032; end of shortened minigene construct was joined to exons 7&#x2013;11, yielding a product containing exon 6, shortened intron 6, and exons 6&#x2013;11; this product was also cloned into the pTarget vector. In the third step both constructs were digested with SacI and a fragment containing exons 1&#x2013;6 and extending into the intronic region was used to replace the 5&#x2032; part of the construct encoding exon 6, intron 6, and exons 7&#x2013;11. The resulting construct consisted of a chimera of partial <italic>LHCGR</italic> cDNAs and intron 6 containing exon 6A. Sequence fidelity was repeatedly verified by complete DNA sequencing of the different constructs. Primers used for amplification were as follows. LHCGR exons 1&#x2013;6, forward primer 5&#x2032;-ATGAAGCAGCGGTTCTCGGCGCTGC-3&#x2032;; reverse primer 5&#x2032;-GCATTTCCTGGTATGGTGGTTATGTGTAAGTTATCAC-3&#x2032;.

        <title>A Cryptic, Functional Exon in the <italic>LHCGR</italic> Gene</title>
        <p>In our effort to clone <italic>LHCGR</italic> variants we screened a cynomolgus testis cDNA library and human granulosa cell mRNA for <italic>LHCGR</italic> transcripts, and systematically identified unusual <italic>LHCGR</italic> variants consisting of exons 1 to 6 and additional unknown sequences either terminated by a poly(A) tail or continuing with exons 7&#x2013;11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050088-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). A BLAST search yielded a perfect match to the intronic region between exon 6 and 7 of the human <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene (from nucleotide position 33,900 to 34,200). Inspection revealed the presence of a 3&#x2032; splice acceptor site (AG) and a 3&#x2032; polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) indicative of a terminal exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b007">7</xref>]. Moreover, two internal 5&#x2032; splice sites were evident which, together with the 3&#x2032; acceptor site, give rise to a 159 bp (short) or to a 207 bp (long) internal exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050088-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Therefore, the human <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene contains an additional, previously unrecognized putative exon within intron 6 that can be spliced into the novel <italic>LHCGR</italic> transcripts following two different routes. We designated this new exon as exon 6A.</p>

        <p>Exon trap experiments with the human genomic region surrounding exon 6A yielded two transcripts including either 159 bp (short) or 207 bp (long) of the internal exon 6A, indicating specific splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050088-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, agarose gel lane 1). A different primer set revealed the expression of the terminal exon 6A transcript as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050088-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, agarose gel lane 1). Thus, exon 6A is a novel bona fide composite internal/terminal exon within the <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene. However, these experiments did not give any clues as to the presence of these exon 6A variants in native tissues. Therefore, using a different approach we analyzed and quantified the expression pattern of the known <italic>LHCGR</italic> mRNA and of the newly discovered transcripts by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) in human tissues. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050088-g003">Figure 3</xref>, high mRNA levels including exon 6A were detected in granulosa cells and in testes, where the terminal variant expression is about five times higher than that of the known mature mRNA without exon 6A. In addition, low levels of exon 6A transcripts were consistently detected in adrenal tissues. mRNA levels for the two internal exon 6A mRNA variants were significantly lower than in the known <italic>LHCGR</italic> without exon 6A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050088-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

            <p>Exon trap experiments with exon 6A. A genomic fragment of intron 6 of the human <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene including exon 6A and 150 bp upstream and downstream was cloned into the pSPL3 expression vector. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with this construct and RT-PCR performed. Primers for the detection of either internal exon 6A (A) or terminal exon 6A (B) are indicated by the arrows. A representative gel electrophoresis is shown below each expected PCR product. RT-PCR results of COS7 cells transfected with either the pSPL3 construct containing exon 6A (lane 1) or empty pSPL3 vector (lane 2) or untransfected COS7 cells (lane 3 in [A]) are shown. The agarose gel photograph in (B) displays the detection of the spliced terminal exon 6A variant. This splice variant can be obtained only in the exon trap system, when using a primer combination employing SD6 and 6A rev (lane 1 in [B]). In addition to the spliced mRNA variant a second amplicon arose by amplification of a partial fragment of the pSPL3 vector and the DNA construct covering 150 bp 5&#x2032; to exon 6A and exon 6A. The second amplicon, deriving from the DNA construct is therefore also detectable in a reaction omitting the RT-synthesis (lane 3 in [B]). RNA fidelity was confirmed by the detection of &#x3B2;-actin mRNA. These results show that exon 6A is recognized as a bona fide exon and is spliced to give rise to two internal (A) and one terminal variant (B) mRNAs, as predicted by the primary genomic sequence.</p>

        <p>The genomic region including exon 6A is perfectly conserved in the chimpanzee as shown by database sequence comparison. Moreover, we cloned and sequenced the corresponding genomic region in macaque, marmoset monkey, and lemur as representative species of the principal primate lineages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050088-sg001">Figure S1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b009">9</xref>]. Exon 6A presumably arose from a 2.7 kbp insertion, which was found in all primates investigated in this study. Both the internal and the terminal exon 6A are highly conserved in these primates, but comparable sequences are completely lacking in mouse as well as in other species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050088-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Exon 6A maintains phase 2 splicing typical of the <italic>LHCGR</italic> exon organization. However, it contains two stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050088-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and encodes 30 amino acids (pI = 4.5) with no significant sequence homology to any other known protein according to FASTA and BLAST searches. The incorporation of either terminal or internal exon 6A into the transcripts results in a truncated LHCGR protein of 209 amino acids. The expression of such protein using a HA-tagged <italic>LHCGR</italic>-exon 6A vector in transiently transfected COS7 cells revealed a predominantly cytosolic localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050088-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). The presence of stop codons qualifies the <italic>LHCGR</italic> transcript containing the internal exon 6A as a target for NMD, a recently described protein-mediated surveillance mechanism that selectively degrades nonsense mRNAs, thereby regulating protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b010">10</xref>]. Elimination of the stop codons by in vitro mutagenesis significantly increased the efficiency of internal exon 6A inclusion rate in transiently transfected COS7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050088-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Similar results were obtained when transfected cells were treated with cycloheximide, a strong protein synthesis inhibitor, for 4 h (unpublished data). These results indicate that exon 6A might function as novel regulator of <italic>LHCGR</italic> mRNA levels and transcript pattern. Upon inclusion of the internal exon 6A, an NMD-mediated process probably results in degradation of the <italic>LHCGR</italic> transcript, while inclusion of terminal exon 6A result in an intracellular, truncated LHCGR protein. Whether the deduced truncated 209 amino acid protein occurs naturally in testis and ovary remains unknown because appropriate antibodies are not available.</p>

Hybridization of human and marmoset ovarian mRNA revealed a unique and consistent binding pattern of the exon 6A probe resulting in a &#x201C;comet-like&#x201D; pattern in the range of 0.5 to 1.4 kb. This finding was specific for the human and marmoset ovary and was not observed in any other tissues tested. The comet-like appearance of exon 6A hybridization in the presence of distinct band patterns characteristic for the <italic>LHCGR</italic> mRNA (ranging from 2.3 to 9.5 kb) using the full-length <italic>LHCGR</italic> cDNA probe, suggests mRNA degradation, consistent with the hypothesis that the <italic>LHCGR</italic> exon 6A internal variants probably undergo NMD.</p>

            <p>Lanes 1 and 4, exon 6A probe. Lanes 2 and 5, full-length <italic>LHCGR</italic> cDNA probe. Lanes 3 and 6, negative control tissues hybridized either to <italic>LHCGR</italic> cDNA (lane 3) or to exon 6A (lane 6). Blots were exposed for 1&#x2013;6 h using a Phosphorimager. An RNA marker was used for size determination of the different transcripts. One Northern blot hybridization out of three independent experiments is shown. While a range of discrete transcripts is identified using the full-length <italic>LHCGR</italic> cDNA probe, a comet-like hybridization pattern, probably representing degraded mRNA transcripts, is detected by an exon 6A-specific probe. These results indicate that (i) transcripts containing exon 6A are naturally present in the ovary and (ii) they undergo massive degradation, possibly by NMD. &#x3B2;-actin hybridization results are given to demonstrate RNA integrity.</p>

        <title>Mutations of Exon 6A Are Associated with LCH/46,XY DSD</title>
        <p>We screened 16 clinically well-characterized patients with the overt phenotype of LCH and no known mutations in <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene for genetic alterations in exon 6A. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, for which the first represents a nonsynonymous SNP at nucleotide position 599 (starting from exon 1, rs4637137, NCBI-SNP database, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/</ext-link>) of the <italic>LHCGR</italic> changing ATG (Met) into ACG (Thr). The other two SNPs are located at nucleotide position A653G (rs4490239, SNP database) and at nucleotide position T748G (not found in the SNP database) within the noncoding region of exon 6A. Determination of the different SNPs in the patient group and in a cohort of 41 males lacking mutations showed similar distribution and frequencies. The SNPs T599C and A653G appear to be in LD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050088-st001">Table S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Apart from these SNPs present also in an appropriately sized control group, we identified three patients from two families with mutations of exon 6A. In two sisters with LCH we found a homozygous A to C mutation at position 557 within exon 6A, leading to an amino acid change from Glu (G<underline>A</underline>G) to Ala (G<underline>C</underline>G) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050088-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The two patients were from consanguineous parents who each carried the same heterozygous mutation, but without any apparent phenotype. An immunofluorescence-based comparison of the mutated LHCGR terminal exon 6A protein variant using a HA-tagged <italic>LHCGR</italic> and the wild-type LHCGR terminal exon 6A protein variant yielded no obvious difference; in both cases a predominantly cytosolic localization was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050088-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). A heterozygous G to C transversion at position 558 of exon 6A was found in another patient with LCH from an independent family who was concomitantly carrier of a heterozygous inactivating mutation in exon 11 of the <italic>LHCGR,</italic> leading to the complete absence of signal transduction upon stimulation with hCG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050088-sg005">Figure S5</xref>A). The two mutations were located on different alleles (compound heterozygosis; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050088-sg005">Figure S5</xref>B).</p>
        <p>According to the ESE finder software, the A557C mutation strengthens and the G558C mutation abolishes a binding site for the splicing factor SRp55 (consensus sequence TG<underline>CG</underline>TC, mutation sites underlined). We therefore analyzed the effects of the mutations on the <italic>LHCGR</italic> transcript pattern in vitro. Exon trap experiments revealed a 4-fold higher expression level of the A557C exon 6A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050088-g004">Figure 4</xref>) and a 6-fold increase of the G558C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050088-sg005">Figure S5</xref>C) internal variants compared to wild type. The entire <italic>LHCGR</italic> genomic region from exon 6 to exon 7 from one patient with the A557C exchange and from one control were cloned and expressed in COS7 cells, and the transcript pattern quantified by real-time RT-PCR. The mutation did not induce any change in the expression level of the transcript without exon 6A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050088-g006">Figure 6</xref>). However, the transcript containing the mutated, terminal exon 6A showed 2.5-fold higher levels compared to the wild type. The long internal exon 6A variant was about 5-fold more expressed, whereas for the short internal exon 6A variant the expression level changed dramatically, with about 3,000-fold increase compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050088-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

        <p>In order to assess the functional consequences of the mutation we conducted signal transduction studies using constructs consisting of two cDNAs covering exons 1&#x2013;6 and 7&#x2013;11 joined by a fragment of intron 6 including exon 6A with or without the A557C mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050088-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). Functionality at the transcriptional level was tested in transiently transfected COS7 cells. Using primer combinations directed to exon 6 and exon 7 of the <italic>LHCGR,</italic> RT-PCR yielded a predominantly expressed amplicon lacking exon 6A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050088-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). However, this pattern was completely reversed when analyzing the A557C mutation, which resulted in inclusion of both short and long variants of exon 6A. In functional experiments, increasing doses of hCG were able to significantly increase extracellular cAMP concentrations only when the cells were transfected with the expression vector containing the wild-type minigene, while response was practically abolished in the presence of the A557C mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050088-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). These data suggest that the mutation in exon 6A specifically alters the splicing pattern of the <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene, with a large increase of transcripts not contributing to the generation of the mature, full-length receptor protein, and it thereby prevents the physiological cAMP response to hCG stimulation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We detected a previously unrecognized, functional exon in the <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene that is present only in human and other primates. The appearance of novel exons in the primate lineage has been described for other receptor genes as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b011">11</xref>]. For example, a novel 5&#x2032; exon was identified in the human tumor necrosis factor receptor gene type 2, which evolved during evolution from an ALU element to a fully functional exon present only in apes and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b012">12</xref>]. Exon 6A was detected in all primate species analyzed, and we identified an IMAGE consortium clone from the Old World monkey <named-content content-type="genus-species">Macaca mulatta</named-content> testis in the EST-NCBI database that, despite its poor sequence quality, resembles the <italic>LHCGR</italic> exon 6A terminal variant. On the other hand, exon 6A-like sequences are not found in nonprimate species such as rat, mouse, dog, and fish. Therefore, this novel exon is confined to primates, where it is highly conserved, indicating strong functional constraints. We suggest that the genomic organization of the <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene in the primates be revised to include exon 6A, and hypothesize that the mRNA transcript without exon 6A encoding for the known LHCGR protein represents a splicing variant of the revised <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050088-sg002">Figure S2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b013">13</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that the appearance of exon 6A in the primate <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene is connected with the evolutionary appearance of CG in primates and its function during sexual differentiation and in pregnancy recognition and maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b010">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>Northern blot hybridizations revealed a unique pattern for exon 6A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050088-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The strength of the signal obtained with the exon 6A probe, which is at least comparable with the signal intensities of the full-length <italic>LHCGR</italic> mRNA, corroborates the finding obtained from the relative quantification studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050088-g004">Figure 4</xref>), while the comet-like signal indicates a spectrum of transcripts of various lengths. If, as postulated, exon 6A-containg transcripts undergo NMD this pattern could derive from partially degraded transcripts from the <italic>LHCGR</italic> exon 6A internal variants and from the terminal exon 6 variant (calculated size approximately 650 bp). A comparison with transcript patterns from other genes/exons undergoing NMD is not possible, since to our knowledge no other data on Northern blot hybridization of such transcripts have yet been performed.</p>
      <p>The exact role of exon 6A is not fully understood yet. However, this is the first time to our knowledge that a human disease has been strongly associated with mutations in a cryptic exon that resembles a target for NMD and does not contribute to the final/mature protein structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b014">14</xref>]. We hypothesize that the mutations in exon 6A described in this paper result in modifications of the relative amounts of each <italic>LHCGR</italic> transcript in the Leydig cells, with highly increased accumulation of variants including exon 6A. This dramatic change overwhelms the NMD machinery and/or alters the pattern of protein translation and transportation, resulting in an insufficient amount of full-length, mature LHCGR protein at the cell surface. This assumption is corroborated by the in vitro functional data demonstrating the incapability of the A557C construct to produce enough functional receptor protein and by the fact that immunohistological staining for the LHCGR in testis sections of the A557C patient was negative, whereas Leydig cells from sections of intact testes and from LCH patients displaying a &#x201C;classical&#x201D; inactivating mutation, hindering proper membrane trafficking or signal transduction of the LHCGR, stained positive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050088-sg004">Figure S4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b016">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>The phenotype of exon 6A mutations, i.e., LCH and 46,XY DSD, is illuminating and supportive for a strong regulatory function of exon 6A. We propose that a complex network, including the novel transcripts described here and involving NMD, regulates <italic>LHCGR</italic> expression at both the transcriptional and translational level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050088-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The spectrum of <italic>LHCGR</italic> transcripts includes forms with and without exon 6A, but only the <italic>LHCGR</italic> mRNA transcript lacking exon 6A will lead to a functional protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b017">17</xref>]. The levels of such a &#x201C;normal&#x201D; transcript and its translation probably depend on the correct function of two distinct regulatory avenues processing the <italic>LHCGR</italic> mRNA including exon 6A. On one side the variant in which exon 6A acts as terminal exon may give rise to a protein potentially capable of hormone binding and/or of interaction with the mature LHCGR protein, thereby acting as modifier of hormone action. On the other side the correct processing of the <italic>LHCGR</italic> transcripts without exon 6A may depend on the elimination by NMD of the variants including the internal exon 6A. This complex pattern of <italic>LHCGR</italic> transcripts form a network which, considering the strong physiological constraints of LH/CG action, must be tightly regulated. We postulate that the strict regulation of this network is crucial for establishing the correct ratio between the transcripts, which in turn allows proper LHCGR functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b018">18</xref>]. This view is supported by the fact that the internal and terminal exon 6A transcripts are physiologically detected along with the &#x201C;normal&#x201D; <italic>LHCGR</italic> mRNA in testes and granulosa cells. Should exon 6A be mutated, the NMD machinery might be unable to process the transcripts efficiently and, if a substantial part of them is translated, the functional LHCGR protein will compete with the truncated LHCGR protein derived from terminal and internal exon 6A variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b020">20</xref>]. Via dimerization of the full-length LHCGR with the truncated exon 6A variant, this might result in improper receptor trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050088-b021">21</xref>].</p>

          <p>Hypothetical model of the transcriptional network of the <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene including the novel exon 6A in the wild type (hollow arrows) or mutated (filled arrows) forms. The primary transcript of the <italic>LHCGR</italic> gene includes exon 6A, which can then be skipped in the mature mRNA giving rise to the full-length LHCGR protein, or is spliced into the terminal or internal exon 6A variants. Since exon 6A contains a stop codon (asterisk), the terminal variant may be translated into a truncated LHCGR protein, which remains mainly trapped within the cell and could hypothetically interact with the mature, full-length protein. Conversely, the stop codon in the internal 6A variants is recognized by the NMD pathway, which actively eliminates these transcripts. Under physiological conditions, both the mature transcript without exon 6A and the terminal 6A variant are present in roughly equal amounts in cells normally expressing the <italic>LHCGR</italic> (hollow arrows of equal width). In mutation(s) of exon 6A, the NMD surveillance mechanism is probably inadequate to eliminate the internal exon 6 variants, which accumulate in the cell and alter the relative abundance of the various transcripts, possibly resulting in an excessive increase of truncated LHCGR protein, incompatible with &#x201C;normal&#x201D; receptor function.</p>

      <p>This paper is dedicated to Prof. Dr. E. Nieschlag and to S. Nieschlag, MA, for their tireless efforts on behalf of reproductive endocrinology and for supporting our work over the years. We thank E. Lahrmann, N. Terwort, and R. Sandhowe for invaluable technical assistance. We are grateful to Prof. Dr. N. Albers for providing the DNA of one patient, to Dr. V. Nordhoff and Dr. S. Kliesch for providing human granulosa cells and testis tissue and to Dr. C. M. Luetjens for histological analysis of testicular samples, immunohistochemistry of LHCGR exon 6A protein expression, and help in preparing the illustrations. The LHCGR antibody was kindly provided Dr. F. Malavasi, University of Turin, Italy.</p>
