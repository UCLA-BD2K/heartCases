        <p>Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (DLVOTO) is a common condition in cats
and humans. In this case report, a dog is described with DLVOTO secondary to severe
intra-abdominal hemorrhage caused by a hemangiosarcoma. The dog was a 9-year-old, 35.7-kg,
spayed female German Shepard dog that presented with a history of tachypnea and collapse.
A Levine II/VI systolic murmur was present at the heart base. Abdominal ultrasonography
revealed a splenic mass and a large amount of ascites. Echocardiography showed a reduced
left ventricular diameter and an increased aortic velocity caused by systolic anterior
motion (SAM) of the mitral valve apparatus. The heart murmur and the SAM were resolved
after treatment including a splenectomy and a blood transfusion.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (DLVOTO) is a common condition in cats and
humans and can be seen with or without hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Reports of dogs
with HCM have been published [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; however, other causes of
DLVOTO have also been reported [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Hypertrophy of the left ventricle, secondary to DLVOTO following
systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve apparatus is observed, especially in young
terrier-breed dogs. This is similar to what is seen in cats with HCM; however, the DLVOTO in
these young dogs is resolved after maturation or after treatment with beta-blockers [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Other causes
of DLVOTO are a reduced left ventricular volume, a decreased afterload or an increased
contractility in cats and in humans [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Indeed, DLVOTO secondary to furosemide usage was
observed in a dog with pulmonary hypertension, which may have been due to the concurrent
occurrences of reduced pulmonary venous drainage secondary to the pulmonary hypertension and
reduced body fluid volume following the use of diuretics [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this report, we encountered a dog with transient DLVOTO following
hypovolemia caused by severe intra-abdominal hemorrhage secondary to a splenic
hemangiosarcoma. To our knowledge, secondary DLVOTO following severe hemorrhage in dogs has
not been described in previous reports.</p>
    <p>A 9-year-old spayed female German Shepherd Dog, weighing 35.7 kg, was presented to the
referring veterinarian with signs of tachypnea, collapse and increased abdominal girth after
walking. Hypodermoclysis was performed before referral to the veterinary hospital of Azabu
University for an emergency laparotomy, because severe intra-abdominal hemorrhage was
suspected after the referring veterinarian performed abdominal fluid analysis.</p>
    <p>On physical examination, the body temperature was 37.7&#xB0;C, the heart rate was 174 bpm, and the
respiration rate was increased (42 /min) and labored. Femoral pulses were detectable, and
capillary refill time was within 1 sec. The systolic blood pressure was measured using a
Doppler ultrasound device and was 110 mmHg. Auscultation revealed a systolic murmur with the
punctum maximum over the left heart base (Levine II/VI), which had not been detected
previously. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a splenic mass with an 8-cm diameter and a
large amount of ascites. The ascites properties were not examined at our hospital, because the
referring veterinarian had highly suspected hemorrhage from splenic rupture after performing
abdominal fluid analysis. Hematology results revealed a red cell count of 599.0 &#xD7;
10<sup>4</sup> cells/<italic>&#xB5;l </italic>(reference range: 550.0&#x2013;850.0 &#xD7; 10<sup>4</sup>
cells/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>); a packed cell volume (PCV) of 41.3% (reference range:
37.0&#x2013;55.0%); a hemoglobin concentration of 13.8 g/d<italic>l </italic>(reference range:
12.0&#x2013;18.0 g/d<italic>l</italic>); a mean corpuscular volume of 68.9 f<italic>l
</italic>(reference range: 66&#x2013;77 f<italic>l</italic>); and a mean corpuscular hemoglobin
concentration of 33.4 g/d<italic>l </italic>(reference range: 32.0&#x2013;36.0
g/d<italic>l</italic>). In addition to these normal values, leukogram was consistent with a
mature neutrophilia (segmented neutrophil of 27,342 cells/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>, reference
range: 3,000&#x2013;11,500 cells/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>; lymphocyte of 743 cells/d<italic>l</italic>,
reference range: 1,000&#x2013;4,800 cells/d<italic>l</italic>; and monocyte of 1,635
cells/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>, reference range: 150&#x2013;1,350 cells/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>).
Biochemical examination revealed a mild azotemia (blood urea nitrogen: 33.4
mg/d<italic>l</italic>, reference range: 9.2&#x2013;29.9 mg/d<italic>l</italic>) and a mild
hypoproteinemia (total protein: 5.0 g/d<italic>l</italic>, reference range: 5.1&#x2013;7.7
g/d<italic>l</italic>). Blood coagulation tests involving fibrin degradation products did
not show any significant abnormalities apart from an elevation of C-reactive protein (2.95
mg/d<italic>l</italic>, reference range: &lt;1.0 mg/d<italic>l</italic>). Thoracic
radiography revealed a reduced heart size (vertebral heart score 9.1 vertebrae [v], reference
range: 9.7 &#xB1; 0.5 v [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]) and a narrowed caudal vena cava.
Echocardiography showed a reduced normalized left ventricular end-diastolic diameter
(LVDd-index) at 0.86, reference range: 1.27&#x2013;1.85 [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; a
reduced normalized end-systolic left ventricular diameter (LVDs-index) at 0.55, reference
range: 0.71&#x2013;1.26 [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; and an increased end-diastolic
left ventricular free wall thickness [LVFd] at 1.38 cm, reference range: 0.66&#x2013;1.36 cm [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The LA/Ao ratio was 1.27. The aortic velocity was 3.38
m/sec with a scimitar-shaped profile caused by the systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the
mitral valve apparatus; however, because this examination was performed emergently, the image
quality was not sufficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Echocardiogram A) At the first presentation (Day 0): Systolic anterior motion of the
mitral valve apparatus was observed on the right parasternal left ventricular long axis
view (dotted arrow, top). The aortic flow was increased (3.38 m/sec) with a scimitar
shape; however, the image quality was not sufficient, because echocardiography was
performed emergently (bottom). B) Day 9: SAM of the mitral valve apparatus has resolved
(top). C) Day 667: Septal leaflet and/or chordae tendineae appear close to the left
ventricular outflow tract in systole (arrow, top). The aortic flow was 0.92 m/sec with a
normal profile (bottom).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-1187-g001"/></fig>). Color-flow Doppler echocardiography revealed a slight mitral regurgitation secondary
to SAM of the mitral valve apparatus. The bodyweight, measured 9 days after the first
presentation when the dog was recovered to her normal clinical status, was 33.6 kg. This
bodyweight was used for normalization of the echocardiographic parameters, because the
bodyweight at first presentation could have been affected by the severe hemorrhage and the
treatment. Splenic rupture was suspected after the initial examinations, and emergency
laparotomy was performed in combination with a transfusion of whole blood (400
m<italic>l</italic>) and infusion of hydroxyethylated starch (150 m<italic>l</italic>). The
general anesthesia protocol consisted of induction with fentanyl (10 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/kg,
intravenously [IV]), midazolam (0.2 mg/kg, IV) and propofol (1&#x2013;2 mg/kg, IV); and maintenance
with fentanyl (5 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/kg/hr, constant rate infusion [CRI]) and isoflurane
(1.5&#x2013;2.0% in 100% oxygen). Cefazolin was administered before surgery (25 mg/kg, IV) and
continued for 7 days post surgery (25 mg/kg, per os, q 8 hr). Lactated Ringer&#x2019;s solution was
administered during surgery (10 m<italic>l</italic>/kg/hr, IV) and was continued for 1 day
after surgery (2&#x2013;5 m<italic>l</italic>/kg/hr, IV). Laparotomy was performed via midline
incision. Rupture of spleen was evident, and a large amount of hemorrhagic ascites (900
m<italic>l</italic>) was observed in the abdominal cavity. Although ventricular bigeminy was
observed during surgery, this resolved after the administration of lidocaine (2 mg/kg, IV
bolus, followed by 25&#x2013;80 mcg/kg/min, CRI). A splenectomy was performed routinely using
absorbable monofilament sutures. The abdominal musculature, subcutaneous tissue and skin were
closed routinely, and the dog recovered uneventfully from general anesthesia. The fentanyl was
continued via the transdermal route for postoperative analgesia. The pathological examination
of the ruptured spleen revealed the presence of a splenic hemangiosarcoma. The day after
surgery, no heart murmur could be detected. However, the blood results revealed mild anemia
with a red cell count of 486.0 &#xD7; 10<sup>4 </sup>/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>, a packed cell volume of
33.3% and a hemoglobin concentration of 11.1 g/d<italic>l</italic>. The owner declined the
advised adjunctive chemotherapy. The dog was discharged at day 9, after resolution of the
clinical signs including the heart murmur. The echocardiography was performed at the day of
discharge and revealed that the LVDd-index and LVWd were within normal range with a LVDd-index
of 1.75, and a LVWd of 1.24 cm. The LVDs-index was 1.49, and the fractional shortening was
49.5%. The LA/Ao ratio was 1.56. SAM of the mitral valve apparatus was not detected, although
data of the aortic flow were lacking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The
dog was presented again 667 days after the first presentation with two 3 to 4 cm cutaneous
tumors, one on the left exterior cubital region and one on the right interior tarsus. No
systemic signs were present, and both tumors were pathologically diagnosed as a hemangioma. No
evidence of recurrence or metastasis of the splenic hemangiosarcoma was detected during
diagnostic imaging including abdominal ultrasonography, echocardiography, and thoracic and
abdominal radiography. On physical examination, no heart murmur was detected. The VHS was
within the normal range on thoracic radiography at 9.4 v. The echocardiography revealed an
end-diastolic left ventricular diameter that was smaller than measured at day 9 but within the
normal range. The LVDd-indices were 1.41 and 1.75 at day 667 and day 9, respectively. The LVWd
and LVDs-indices were also within the normal range at 1.09 and 0.90, respectively. The LA/Ao
ratio was 1.32. The DLVOTO secondary to SAM of the mitral valve apparatus had disappeared, and
the aortic velocity was 0.92 m/s with a normal profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1C</xref>); however, the mitral septal leaflet and/or the chordae tendineae appeared
close to the LVOT in systole on the right parasternal left ventricular long axis view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>
    <p>DLVOTO secondary to SAM of the mitral valve apparatus is a common manifestation in humans and
cats with HCM [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; however, HCM is an uncommon finding
in dogs [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Apart from HCM, DLVOTO can also be associated
with congenital heart disease. Hypertrophy of the left ventricle resolves gradually when SAM
of the mitral valve apparatus disappears during maturation. This congenital type of DLVOTO is
commonly detected as a benign temporary systolic heart murmur in young dogs, especially in
young terrier-breeds [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Beta-blockers were reported to improve the obstruction following DLVOTO
markedly in these young dogs [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the current case report, DLVOTO did not appear to be caused by a
congenital problem, because the dog had no record of a heart murmur at a young age. In
addition, HCM was not the cause of DLVOTO in this dog, because hypertrophy of the left
ventricle was resolved after the transfusion and even at day 667. Indeed, increased wall
thickness secondary to severe dehydration has been described in cats, i.e.,
&#x201C;pseudohypertrophy&#x201D; [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The following pathologies could
also be a cause of DLVOTO: 1) a decreased preload in which a decreased left ventricular
diameter could narrow the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT); 2) an increased contractility
of the left ventricle in which hyperkinesia of the left ventricle could narrow the LVOT as
described in excited cats [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; and 3) a decreased
afterload in which hyperkinesia of the left ventricle after a decreased peripheral vascular
resistance could narrow the LVOT [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this case, hypovolemia secondary to acute severe
abdominal hemorrhage appeared to be the main cause of DLVOTO. Indeed, this situation induces
narrowing of the LVOT [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition, increased sympathetic activity and endogenous
catecholamine release following severe hemorrhage [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]
might affect the DLVOTO, because of increased cardiac contractility. However, the
contractility of the left ventricle might have been weakened, because of the reduced preload,
according to the Frank-Starling law [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
    <p>SAM of the mitral valve apparatus could be caused by an elongated mitral leaflet due to
degenerative mitral valve disease or mitral valve dysplasia, excessive mitral annuloplasty, or
abnormal placement of the papillary muscle due to mitral valve dysplasia [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this case,
an elongated mitral leaflet or malalignment of the papillary muscles could not be excluded;
although, mitral valve regurgitation secondary to degenerative mitral valve disease could not
be detected even at day 667. Mitral valve dysplasia is another possible cause of DLVOTO in
this dog, since the septal leaflet and/or the chordae tendineae appeared close to the LVOT in
systole at day 667 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1C</xref>, top). Mitral valve
dysplasia is reported to be associated with DLVOTO [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>],
although it is unlikely that this dog had mitral valve dysplasia, because she had no heart
murmur or significant echocardiographic abnormalities, including mitral regurgitation, after
the treatments. However, a postmortem examination should be performed to elucidate whether
mild mitral valve dysplasia was present in this dog.</p>
    <p>Secondary DLVOTO should be considered when systolic cardiac murmur is detected in dogs with
severe hemorrhage. However, severe anemia can cause heart murmur because of an increased
Reynolds number, which is defined by fictitious force and viscous force [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], although the anemia could
not have intensified the cardiac murmur in the current case because the acute hemorrhage
caused the red blood cells and blood plasma to be equally lost from the vessels into the
abdominal cavity [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
    <p>In conclusion, DLVOTO should be considered in dogs with hypovolemia caused by pathologies
like acute severe hemorrhage, especially when a systolic heart murmur is detected. DLVOTO can
induce a hemodynamic deterioration, because of a low cardiac output combined with a decreased
preload [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. To our knowledge, this is the first
report of DLVOTO secondary to acute severe hemorrhage in a dog. Nonetheless, other causes of
DLVOTO including elongated mitral leaflet and malalignment of papillary muscles secondary to
mitral valve dysplasia cannot be excluded in the current case. Further information needs to be
obtained during postmortem examination.</p>
