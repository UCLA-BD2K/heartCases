      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p><italic>Actinomyces</italic> is a gram positive,
non-spore-forming anaerobic or microaerophilic bacterial rod
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. <italic>Actinomyces israelii</italic> causes most
<italic>Actinomyces</italic> infections in humans, although other forms
such as <italic>Actinomyces</italic> Odontolyticus, <italic>Actinomyces</italic>
Viscosus, <italic>Actinomyces</italic> Meyeri, <italic>Actinomyces</italic>
Gerencseriae, and Propionibacterium Propionicum have also been
reported. <italic>Actinomyces</italic> infections are commonly
polymicrobial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. <italic>Actinomyces israelii</italic> is a normal
component of oral and genital tract flora 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] with
infections being reported in the oral-cervicofacial, thoracic,
abdominal, pelvic, CNS, musculoskeletal regions as well as
disseminated disease. The present case describes a postmenopausal
woman, without an IUD, presented with a vulvar mass suspicious for
neoplasm that was caused by <italic>Actinomyces israelii</italic>.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 60 year-old, African American woman, gravida 1,
para 1, presented to her primary gynecologist with complaints of
an enlarging, tender vulvar mass. The patient had first noticed a
&#x201C;lump&#x201D; 5 months earlier; however she did not seek medical
attention until the mass had grown to about 10 cm size. The
patient was referred to the hospital for further evaluation, with
the suspicious of malignancy.</p>
      <p>The patient's past medical history was significant for
polyarthritis, and recently diagnosed hypertension well
controlled without antihypertensives. She had a hernia
surgically repaired in 1998, and had undergone one spontaneous
vaginal delivery without complication. She had an unremarkable
gynecologic history including a normal pap smear within the last
year; no IUD was used since she experienced menopause at 53 years
old. She denied hormone or tobacco use. Her family history was
negative for breast, ovarian, or colon cancer.</p>
      <p>The patient underwent further evaluation upon admission to the
hospital. Examination revealed a 10 cm vulvar mass involving
the right mons and right labia majora (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The
mass was nodular in contour, fixed, nonulcerated, with multiple
sinus tracts draining serosanguinous fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
      <p>The cervix was small and mobile as was the uterus on pelvic exam.
There were palpable right inguinal nodes. Laboratory evaluation
was normal except for an elevated WBC, for which the patient was
placed on a broad spectrum antibiotic. A CT of the
chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed a normal chest and abdomen. The
pelvic CT revealed a 10 cm vulvar mass with solid and cystic
components without associated adenopathy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
      <p>The patient was subsequently taken to the operating room for
vulvar biopsy; a wedge shape tissue sample was taken from the mons
lesion, with a smaller tissue samples from the right labia majora
and inguinal region. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were also
obtained in the operating room. Pathology revealed a ruptured
epidermal inclusion cyst containing granulation tissue, acute and
chronic inflammation, and multinucleated giant cells. Cultures
were positive for <italic>Actinomyces israelii</italic>,
<italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic>, and <italic>Peptostreptococcus</italic>.</p>
      <p>Infectious disease was consulted postoperatively; recommendations
included an intravenous course of third generation cephalosporin for
6 weeks, followed by oral antibiotics until disease resolution is
observed. Three options were discussed with the patient: expectant
management, medical therapy, or surgical extirpation followed by
antibiotics. The patient opted for antibiotic treatment. A PICC
line was placed to facilitate extended IV antibiotic
administration of ceftriaxone (Rocephin; 2 gm IV for 12
weeks). Home health nursing was arranged, and the patient was
discharged home in stable condition.</p>

    <sec sec-type="discussion">
      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Our case illustrates an atypical presentation of <italic>Actinomyces israelii</italic> as a large vulvar mass in a postmenopausal patient.
<italic>Actinomyces israelii</italic> of the vulva is a rare occurrence,
represented by limited reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It is thought that infection
occurs after disruption of the mucosal barrier. The lesion
appearance is a single or multiple indurated masses, which may
contain flocculent areas; these lesions are often mistaken for
neoplasms. Progression is slow, often with development of draining
sinus tracts.</p>
      <p>Diagnosis of <italic>Actinomyces israelii</italic> is
difficult, as even one dose of antibiotics prior to culture can
obscure results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].
Culture requires 5&#x2013;7 days but may take 2&#x2013;4 weeks. &#x201C;Sulfur
granules&#x201D; are actually yellow colored aggregates of
microorganisms; they do not contain sulfur and are therefore a
misnomer. These are usually isolated from purulent material and
can be visible macroscopically as well as microscopically. Not
all <italic>Actinomyces</italic> species form sulfur granules.
Treatment classically begins with IV penicillin for 2&#x2013;6 weeks,
followed by oral therapy with pencillin or amoxicillin for 6&#x2013;12
months. For penicillin allergic patients, tetracycline,
erythromycin, minocycline and clindamycin have been administered.
Imipenem and ceftriaxone have been described as successful in
reports. Medical therapy is an acceptable treatment option if the
patient is stable and reliable for follow up. If, however, the
patient is critical or the disease site is critical, a combined
approach may be more reasonable.</p>
      <p>Pelvic infections involving <italic>Actinomyces</italic> in
association with the use of IUDs are well established 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].
Since our patient was postmenopausal, with no evidence of IUD,
<italic>Actinomyces israelii</italic> was not suspected.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, <italic>Actinomyces israelii</italic> may
produce vulvar lesions that are suspicious for malignancy. Thus,
biopsies and cultures are both mandatory while evaluating vulvar
masses suspicious for malignancy.</p>
