      <abstract>
        <p>Autoimmune pancreatitis is a rare but important cause of pancreatitis that is becoming increasingly recognized in the West. Lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis (LPSP) is a benign form of chronic pancreatitis characterized clinically by infrequent attacks of abdominal pain, jaundice, and weight loss, and pathologically by focal or diffuse chronic or lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrates centered around pancreatic ducts and ductules, accompanied by obliterative phlebitis, acinar atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis. It has been described alone or as a part of the spectrum of autoimmune gallbladder and biliary tract disease, with clinical, radiological, and pathological overlap reported with primary sclerosing cholangitis. It has been described as "primary sclerosing pancreatitis," "sclerosing cholangitis," "non-alcoholic duct destructive chronic pancreatitis," and "autoimmune pancreatitis." We report a case of LPSP that mimicked pancreatic adenocarcinoma and was subsequently treated with a pylorus-preserving Whipple procedure. This may point towards a primary biliary autoimmune process involving the pancreatic duct, causing a benign form of chronic pancreatitis that may be difficult to characterize pre-operatively to avoid surgery. This case typifies the growing awareness of this relatively recently characterized clinical entity, its similar presentation to pancreatic carcinoma, and the importance for LPSP to be included in the differential diagnosis of pancreaticobiliary disease. Finally, we review the literature.</p>
