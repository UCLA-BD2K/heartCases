          <p>This is the first report of HVDRR caused by UPD, and the third case of complete UPD of chromosome 12, in the published literature. Genome-wide SNP array was useful for detecting isodisomy and the parental origin of the allele. Comprehensive examination of the homozygous state is essential for accurate genetic counseling of recurrence risk and appropriate monitoring for other chromosome 12 related disorders. Furthermore, oral calcium therapy was effective as an initial treatment for rickets in this instance.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hereditary 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]<sub>2</sub>D)-resistant rickets (HVDRR) (OMIM #277440), also known as vitamin D-dependent rickets type 2A (VDDR 2A), is a rare disorder characterized by early onset rickets, hypocalcemia, and secondary hyperparathyroidism, and alopecia when severe [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Patients with HVDRR have high circulating levels of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, and are resistant to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and 1&#x3B1;(OH)D<sub>3</sub> treatment. Elevated 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D levels differentiate HVDRR from 1&#x3B1;-hydroxylase deficiency, which is known as vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1A [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>HVDRR is caused by mutations in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene on chromosome 12q13.11 [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. HVDRR shows autosomal-recessive inheritance and the patients usually have biallelic mutations in the <italic>VDR</italic> inherited from each parent. Because of the rarity of the disease, most cases arise in consanguineous families and have homozygous mutations [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. VDR is a member of the steroid/nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, and it is composed of an N-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD) and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Patients with a mutation in the DBD usually show severe vitamin D resistance associated with alopecia [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], whereas those with a mutation in the LBD show various degrees of vitamin D unresponsiveness and can occasionally respond to high-dose vitamin D. Patients with alopecia showing resistance to high-dose vitamin D therapy usually require intravenous calcium infusions to treat clinically overt rickets at their first presentation [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>Some recessive disorders have been reported to be caused by uniparental disomy (UPD) of a single parent allele with a mutation [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. UPD refers to a condition in which both homologues of a chromosomal region or segment are inherited from only one parent. To date, most cases of UPD have been found in imprinting diseases such as Prader-Willi syndrome, and the incidence of UPD of any chromosome is estimated to be as frequent as 1 per 3,500 live births [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Conversely, UPD causing recessive diseases have only been reported in a limited number of cases. Moreover, no cases have been reported in HVDRR and complete isodisomy of chromosome 12 is extremely rare [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this report, we used genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis to determine whether HVDRR was caused by UPD of chromosome 12. Furthermore, we observed the effectiveness of high oral calcium therapy for the treatment of rickets in this severe HVDRR patient.</p>

        <title>Clinical case</title>
        <p>A 2-year 1-month-old girl presented to hospital with fever, at which point she was noted to have short stature, alopecia (<xref rid="pone.0131157.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), and gait instability. Her parents were non-consanguineous and approximately 30 years old when she was born. She had no family history of rickets or unresolved pain. Her mother got a natural conception, and the pregnancy and delivery was uneventful. Her birth weight was 2,868 g (-0.8 standard deviations [SD]), birth length 51 cm (+0.6 SD), gestational age 41 weeks. She had no episode of convulsion and her psychomotor development was normal until she started walking alone at 1 year 3 months of age, but she could not run by age 2. Her body height at presentation was 74.8 cm (&#x2212;3.5 SD), and her body weight, 9.7 kg (&#x2212;1.2 SD). She had symptoms of rickets such as bow-legs and enlargement of the limb joints, but had no other external malformation, dysmorphic features, or ataxia. Her verbal developmental quotient (DQ) was 81 and cognitive DQ 94.</p>

        <title>Analysis of the genesis of homozygosity</title>
        <p>Most cases of homozygosity among rare mutations are caused by consanguinity, but the parents in this case denied consanguinity; therefore, we performed a genetic analysis of the parents. The mutation was heterozygous in the mother only, and was not present in the father (<xref rid="pone.0131157.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>).</p>
        <p>To assess the possibility of a gross deletion around the mutation in the father&#x2019;s allele, we sequence-analyzed several common target SNPs in the <italic>VDR</italic>, in other genes on chromosome 12, and in other chromosomes studied in our laboratory. <xref rid="pone.0131157.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the results of the SNPs which identify the parental origin of the proband&#x2019;s allele.

        <p>Next, we assessed the biological paternity by conventional STR analysis. STRs located on chromosomes other than 12 confirmed that the father was the biological father. Interestingly, the STR of a gene located on the short arm of chromosome 12 (vWA; 12p12-pter) showed a homozygous maternal allele (proband 19; father 14, 16; mother 16, 19). Taken together, these findings eliminated the possibility of a gross deletion and paternal discordance, and suggested that <italic>de novo</italic> mutation was unlikely. Finally, maternal UPD of the entire chromosome 12 was suggested.</p>

        <title>Detection of UPD by genome-wide SNP array</title>
        <p>For the evaluation of UPD, we conducted a genome-wide SNP array of the proband and the parents. The overall call rates were 99.47%, 99.64%, and 99.57% for the proband, the father, and the mother, respectively. All chromosomes other than chromosome 12 showed a normal homo/heterozygous pattern. There were 29,197 SNPs on chromosome 12 on the array, of which 13,940 SNPs showed multiple genotypes among the trio of samples (proband, mother, and father). The proband was called homozygous for 13,848 SNPs and heterozygous for 92 SNPs; however, we found that these heterozygous SNPs were miss-calls caused by the genotype calling algorithms, and the proband was considered homozygous for all SNPs on chromosome 12. After linkage disequilibrium pruning (LD pruning) with 474 samples, a total of 8,933 SNPs remained [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], except for bad clusters. <xref rid="pone.0131157.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> shows the B allele frequencies for chromosome 12, which represents the distribution of each proband, maternal, and paternal allele. On chromosome 12, the allele segregation revealed to be composed of only homozygous AA and BB combinations, and no AB combinations (loss of heterozygosity). Allele segregation of chromosome 12 showed a heterozygous pattern in her parents. In the proband&#x2019;s diagram, the pink spots represent the maternal SNPs (1,514 SNPs) and the blue spots, paternal (none) (<xref rid="pone.0131157.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). It was obvious that all of the homozygous SNPs on chromosome 12 derived from the mother. Moreover, the 2 alleles in the proband were 100% identical to those in the mother by identical-by-descent analysis, whereas none were identical to those in the father [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The signal intensity of chromosome 12 was sufficient to conclude that the chromosome was diploid, compared with other chromosomes. Thus, we concluded that the proband had complete maternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 12 with a nonsense mutation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This is the first report of an HVDRR caused by UPD of the mutant allele. We also found that genome-wide SNP array was useful for the detection of the complete isodisomy. We first noted an unusual homozygous state in this non-consanguineous family, and found that only the mother was heterozygous for the mutation. Such non-Mendelian inheritance implied the possibility of gross deletion of the father&#x2019;s allele, non-paternity, UPD, or some <italic>de novo</italic> mutation. However, common SNP sequencing and STR analysis suggested a homozygous chromosome 12 and confirmed paternity, whereas subsequent G-band karyotyping excluded gross deletion of chromosome 12. Finally, the genome-wide SNP array confirmed that complete maternal isodisomy of chromosome 12 was present. This molecular diagnosis is fundamental to ensure accurate genetic counseling of the risk of recurrence in the next child, which would be far less than 25%, as would typically be the case for a recessive disorder.</p>
      <p>Uniparental isodisomy refers the inheritance of two identical copies of the same chromosome, and different from uniparental heterodisomy, which is the inheritance of the two different homologous chromosomes from one parent. Both of isodisomy and heterodisomy can cause genome imprinting disorders, but only uniparental isodisomy can cause recessive disorders if the chromosome harbors a disease-causing mutation. As a result, the mutated allele of her mother became homozygous in the proband to present non-Mendelian inheritance of the autosomal recessive disease, HVDRR. Although high maternal age is suggested as a risk factor for maternal UPD in imprinting disorders, it is mostly meiotic nondisjunction causing heterodisomy and differs for this case of isodisomy [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
      <p>For the molecular detection of UPD, microsatellite marker analysis has been used conventionally, which needs parents&#x2019; samples to demonstrate UPD [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Recently, the new technology of genome-wide SNP array had facilitated the detection of UPD [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. SNP array can detect isodisomy by loss of heterozygosity of the segment or whole chromosome without parents&#x2019; samples. It is sufficient to demonstrate UPD if there are no chromosomal aberration by cytogenetic analysis. More recently, using a signal intensity analysis of the SNP array, it is possible to evaluate the copy number changes, so that even chromosome banding is unnecessary. Furthermore, we have shown it possible to detect the origin of the homozygous chromosome by analyzing together with the parents&#x2019; allele. For example, if the proband&#x2019;s allele is AA, mother&#x2019;s AA or AB, and father&#x2019;s allele BB, the proband&#x2019;s allele reveals to be derived only from the mother. In this point, our study is distinguished from others.</p>
      <p>There are only two reported cases of chromosome 12 UPD leading to recessive disorders, one maternal and one paternal [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], making this the third case. The occurrence of UPD in each chromosome does not appear to be equivalent, and is rare in chromosome 12. UPD of chromosomes 6, 7, 11, 14, 15, and 20 has been reported to cause imprinting disorders; however, none is known for chromosome 12. Although we show the limited period of one case, the fact that our patient shows no other than typical symptoms of HVDRR by the age of 3, suggests that there are no genomic imprinting diseases caused by UPD of maternal chromosome 12. Moreover, it is also suggested that the UPD allele in the proband contained no other disease-causing mutations that would present by the age of 3. In theory, there may be at least 3 other recessive disease-causing mutations in this homozygous chromosome (average mutations &gt; 200 per genome, maternal chromosome 12 constitution approximately 2%) [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The discovery of UPD will require careful observation for late manifestations of other chromosome 12 related genetic disorders. Furthermore, we consider from this study that, although there are relatively few reports of recessive diseases caused by UPD, this phenomenon may be more frequent and only have not analyzed.</p>
      <p>Our patient with deleterious <italic>VDR</italic> mutation was successfully treated with high-dose oral calcium. She had no trouble taking large doses of calcium lactate orally after every meal. Most of the reported cases with severe HVDRR have required intravenous calcium infusions for initial treatment, which often lead to prolonged hospitalizations and increased risks of catheter-related complications [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although oral calcium with vitamin D therapy is reportedly effective in some cases, it is mainly reserved for use as a maintenance therapy [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although this is one unusual case with UPD, the clinical course of our case suggested that oral calcium therapy is effective in the initial treatment in some cases of severe HVDRR.</p>
      <p>Among the intestinal calcium absorption, active transport of calcium through calcium transporters is induced by VDR and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D. On the other hand, high dietary calcium with lactose can induce passive transport, which is considered to be VDR-independent [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It has been shown in the VDR-null mice that bone abnormalities can be rescued by high calcium diet [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We consider that although the mutant VDR in this case is inactive, high calcium diet induced passive calcium transport at the intestine and improved her rickets. However, alopecia is considered as VDR-mediated but not calcium-mediated phenotype, and was unresponsive to high calcium diet, which was also similar to the observations on VDR-null mice [<xref rid="pone.0131157.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>HVDRR in this case was caused by a rare and complete UPD of maternal chromosome 12 with a <italic>VDR</italic> mutation. Genome-wide SNP array helped to detect the isodisomy and parental origin of the allele. Such comprehensive examination of the homozygous state is essential for accurate genetic counseling of recurrence risk and appropriate monitoring for other chromosome 12 related disorders. The treatment course suggested that oral calcium therapy is effective as an initial treatment for rickets in some cases with severe HVDRR.</p>
