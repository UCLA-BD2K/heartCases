    <p>JJSA is an 81-year-old male patient hospitalized for decompensated heart failure. At 71
years of age, he experienced progressive dyspnea that lasted for 1 month and an episode of
palpitation that lasted for 1 day and arrived at at the emergency department. He gave
history of undergoing cardioversion in the past. He was then referred to the outpatient
clinic of the InCor in October 1995. He also reported that he had long-term pulmonary
arterial hypertension and had undergone surgery for the removal of an intracranial hematoma
in the past.</p>
    <p>Physical examination, during the first consultation (October 30, 1995), revealed the
following: heart rate of 76 beats per minute (bpm), systemic blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg,
normal findings on chest auscultation. However, cardiac auscultation revealed normal heart
sounds, regular rhythm, and a systolic murmur (1+/4+) in the aortic area. Abdominal
examination did not reveal any abnormalities and the patient did not have pedal edema.</p>
    <p>ECG (October 30, 1995) showed sinus rhythm with atrial extrasystoles, heart rate of 100
bpm, and signs of right atrial overload (small QRS complex in lead V<sub>1</sub> and normal
in lead V<sub>2</sub>) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

    </fig>
    <p>Four days later, he sought emergency medical assistance because the dyspnea had worsened.
Physical examination (November 3, 1995) showed the patient was in a stable condition, had
tachypnea (respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute), heart rate of 80 bpm, and systemic
arterial pressure of 90/70 mmHg. Chest auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds at the
base of the right lung and crepitations at the base of the left lung. Cardiac auscultation
revealed a regular rhythm with the heart sounds were muffled in both systolic and diastolic
phases. There were no murmurs or pericardial rub. The liver was palpated 3 cm below the
right costal margin and there was swelling of the right calf. Chest X-ray revealed right
atrial opacification; ECG showed no changes.</p>
    <p>The results of the laboratory tests were as follows: hemoglobin 16.9 g/dL, hematocrit 39%,
leucocytes 5,500/mm<sup>3</sup> (60% neutrophils, 33% lymphocytes, and 7% monocytes),
platelets 244,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, sodium 145 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, urea 39 mg/dL,
creatinine 1.7 mg/dL, and blood glucose 97 mg/dL. Room-air pulse oximetry showed pH 7.34,
pO<sub>2</sub> 66 mmHg, pCO<sub>2</sub> 33 mmHg, oxygen saturation 94%, bicarbonate 22
mEq/L, base excess -8 mEq/L.</p>
    <p>Pulmonary perfusion/ventilation scintigraphy (November 3, 1995) showed hypoperfusion in the
right upper lobe, anterior basal and lateral basal segments of the right lower lobe,
lateral basal segment of the left lower lobe, and anterior segment of the left upper lobe.
Ventilation was normal except in the base of the right lung, where it was decreased. The
examination indicated a parenchymatous pathology in the base of the right lung and
thromboembolism in the other pulmonary regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure
2</xref>).</p>

    <p>The patient received oxygen supplementation via nasal catheter (1 L/min), intravenous
heparin (1.000 U/h), 40 mg of oral furosemide, and 37.5 mg of oral captopril daily.</p>
    <p>On the third day of hospitalization the patient showed tachycardia, and ECG revealed atrial
flutter with atrioventricular block 2:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3</xref>).
The patient underwent cardioversion and sinus rhythm was maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Figure 4</xref>) with amiodarone (600 mg daily).</p>

    <p>The dyspnea ameliorated and the patient remained hemodynamically stable. He was discharged
on the seventh day of hospitalization and was prescribed warfarin (5 mg), captopril (38.5
mg), furosemide (40 mg), and digoxin (0.25 mg) daily.</p>
    <p>Echocardiographic evaluation (June 25, 1996) revealed the following measurements: aorta 33
mm, left atrium 52 mm, right ventricle 30 mm, left ventricle (diastole/systole) 64/55 mm,
and ejection fraction 36%. There was thickening of the aortic valve without stenosis,
moderate tricuspid insufficiency, diffuse hypokinesis of both ventricles, and the systolic
pressure of the right ventricle was estimated as 77 mmHg, with signs of pulmonary arterial
hypertension (pulmonary valve corrected with absent A wave). Serological tests for Chagas
disease was negative.</p>
    <p>Echocardiographic evaluation performed later (February 10, 1999) revealed the following
measurements: aorta 34 mm, left atrium 47 mm, right ventricle 33 mm, left ventricle
(diastole/systole) 64/51 mm, and ejection fraction 49%. There was thickening of the aortic
valve with without stenosis, moderate tricuspid insufficiency, diffuse hypokinesis of both
ventricles, and the systolic pressure of the right ventricle was estimated as 79 mmHg, with
signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension (pulmonary valve corrected with absent A
wave).</p>
    <p>The patient always experienced dyspnea on moderate exertion and there were several episodes
of atrial flutter with subsequent 2:1 atrioventricular conduction, and the control of
coagulation was irregular.</p>
    <p>Laboratory tests performed in 2004 showed the following results: TSH 9.54 &#xB5;U/mL, total
cholesterol 112 mg/dL, HDL-C 47 mg/dL, LDL-C 53 mg/dL, triglycerides 52 mg/dL, creatinine
1.1 mg/dL, and glucose 87 mg/dL.</p>
    <p>From 1999 onwards, the patient's daily medication consisted of spironolactone (25 mg),
enalapril (40 mg), furosemide (40 mg), carvedilol (12.5 mg), digoxin (0.25 mg), and
warfarin (5 mg).</p>
    <p>An X-ray obtained on May 10, 2005, revealed right pleural thickening with opacification of
the right costophrenic angle and the lower third of the right hemithorax.</p>
    <p>A laboratory evaluation performed in January 2005 showed that creatinine had increased to
1.9 mg/dL. An analysis performed later (February 2006) showed an even higher level of 2.3
mg/dL, with urea of 66 mg/dL.</p>
    <p>In February 2006, the laboratory tests results were as follows: total cholesterol 84 mg/dL,
triglycerides 44 mg/dL, potassium 4.8 mEq/L, sodium 144 mEq/L, creatinine 2.3 mg/dL, urea
66 mg/dL, glucose 78 mg/dL, and PT-INR 1.6. The urinalysis results were as follows: density
1.01, pH 5.0, protein 0.6 g/L, free hemoglobin +++, leucocytes 56,000/mL, and erythrocytes
30,000/mL.</p>
    <p>The patient was in a stable condition until March 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2006, when he sought
medical assistance because of worsening dyspnea worsening and pedal edema (present for 10
days). He reported having stopped his medication approximately 1 month before.</p>
    <p>Physical examination (March 3, 2006) revealed anasarca, heart rate of 80 bpm, systemic
arterial pressure of 90/70 mmHg, lungs with decreased breath sounds in the base of the left
lung. Cardiac auscultation showed irregular rhythm, muffled heart sounds, and a systolic
murmur (++/4+) in the tricuspid area. There was abdominal swelling without tenderness, and
bowel movements were present. Scrotal and pedal edema were present (++++/4+).</p>
    <p>ECG (March 3, 2006) revealed an irregular rhythm without a visible P wave, frequent
ventricular extrasystoles, low-voltage QRS complexes in the frontal plane and in
V<sub>4</sub> to V<sub>6</sub> leads, and left bundle branch block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

    <p>The laboratory tests performed on March 3, 2006 showed the following results: erythrocytes
4.4 million/mm<sup>3</sup>, hematocrit 43%, hemoglobin 14.4 g%, leukocytes
2,900/mm<sup>3</sup> (neutrophils 56%, eosinophils 2%, lymphocytes 32%, monocytes 16%),
platelets 70,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, PT-INR 1.8, magnesium, 1.9 mEq/L, calcium 4.76 mEq/L,
creatinine 3.3 mg/dL, urea 124 mg/dL, potassium 4.8 mEq/L, sodium 140 mEq/L, and glucose 88
mg/dL.</p>
    <p>The patient received 40 mg of furosemide intravenously and was prescribed 120 mg of
furosemide, 37.5 mg of captopril, and 0.5 mg of digoxin daily.</p>
    <p>The patient was diagnosed with congestive cardiac failure and malnutrition,
thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and pneumonia. He was further prescribed 2 g of ceftriaxone
as antibiotic prophylaxis.</p>
    <p>The patient remained hypotensive and was administered intravenous dobutamine.</p>
    <p>The laboratory test results on the second day of hospitalization (March 4, 2006) revealed
the following: erythrocytes 3.7 million/mm<sup>3</sup>, hemoglobin 12.7 g/dL, hematocrit 36%, MCV 97 &#xB5;m<sup>3</sup>, leukocytes
2,300/mm<sup>3</sup> (neutrophils 60%, eosinophils 2%, lymphocytes 25%, and monocytes
13%), platelets 54,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, urea 127 mg/dL, creatinine 3.3 mg/dL, potassium 4.8
mEq/L, and sodium 145 mEq/L. In the afternoon that day, the patient suffered a
cardiorespiratory arrest and died despite the attempts for cardiopulmonary
resuscitation.</p>

      <title>Clinical aspects</title>
      <p>An 81-year-old man hospitalized for worsening dyspnea. The patient reported having
systemic arterial hypertension for 10 years, with a history of electrical cardioversion
for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia and having been hospitalized in the past for
decompensated heart failure.</p>
      <p>During the penultimate hospitalization he had tachypnea and hypoxemia with the swelling
of the right calf. Chest X-ray revealed opacification of the right lung base. On the
basis of this data, the most probable diagnosis was pulmonary thromboembolism<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by perfusion/ventilation scintigraphy, which showed
hypoperfusion with preserved ventilation. The complementary test most currently used is
angiotomography of the pulmonary arteries, which is an alternative less invasive than
the gold standard technique of pulmonary angiography. Pulmonary perfusion/ventilation
scintigraphy has an important role as it diagnoses 30%-50% cases, although it may have a
high rate of inconclusive results<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Ecocardiography revealed systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction of
36%), enlarged left atrium (47 mm), and increased pulmonary artery pressure, a
complication of pulmonary thromboembolism that is observed in up to 26% of
cases<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Support therapy and anticoagulation treatment were initiated and maintained after
hospital discharge.</p>
      <p>With time, the patient improved but remained oligosymptomatic and showed progressive
renal failure. He showed new cardiac decompensation after having interrupted the use of
medications and was hospitalized for treatment. On admission, leukopenia, lymphopenia,
and thrombocytopenia were observed. On admission, the chest X-ray showed pleural
effusion and a pulmonary consolidation.</p>
      <p>The most probable diagnosis for this elderly patient, who had acute cardiac
decompensation, was hypotensive, and whose chest X-ray showed consolidation, would be
pneumonia and antibiotic therapy should be initiated. However, a diagnosis of
myeloproliferative disorder should be considered because the patient had leukopenia,
lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The pulmonary thromboembolism, due to tumor embolism,
may present itself as a consolidation in the chest X-ray<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Therefore, multiple myeloma is a possible diagnosis, because plasmocyte mutations are
unique, with neoplastic proliferation of plasmocytes and production of monoclonal
immunoglobulin that results in several alterations, such as cytopenia and renal
failure.</p>
      <p>Renal failure occurs in 20% patients with multiple myeloma. Renal damage is caused by
the immunoglobulin light chains produced by the neoplasm. The early mortality rate is
30% among patients with myeloma who progress with renal failure and is mainly associated
with sepsis<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Circulating immunoglobulins in multiple myeloma increase serum viscosity and allow the
formation of thrombi and the occurrence of embolism. Therefore, it is reasonable to
think that the patient may have had deep vein thrombosis followed by pulmonary
thromboembolism, which can be an early manifestation of multiple myeloma<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Cardiac involvement can also occur, usually resulting in recurrent high-output
decompensated cardiac failure<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.
Decompensated heart failure, in patients with multiple myeloma, can be divided into 2
subgroups: low-output failure, which is more common, and high-output failure<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>High-output decompensated cardiac failure usually occurs in patients with with preserved
left ventricular contractility or underlying structural heart disease, which leads to
contractile impairment because of structural deterioration<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The cause of the high-output failure in multiple myeloma remains only partially
understood and has been associated with several factors. These include increased splenic
inflow in patients who have splenomegaly with a splenic inflow increase of 55% (in these
cases, the spleen functions almost like a arteriovenous fistula), anemia, osteoclastic
lesions caused by the disease, which produce substances that lead to high-heart output
state<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Amyloidosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis or associated with multiple
myeloma, because it can coexist in 10% cases<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Most frequently, multiple myeloma occurs first and amyloidosis
develops later. Some authors have reported cases in which amyloidosis was diagnosed
first; however, these cases tend to be more serious and have lower survival of
approximately 1-2 years<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Amyloidosis is an uncommon disease and is therefore often not taken into consideration
during diagnosis. It usually presents as restrictive cardiomyopathy, with systolic
function preserved until its last stage. Biatrial dilation is also present, which leads
to an increase in the incidence of thromboembolic events<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Therefore, secondary causes should be investigated in elderly patients with dilated
cardiomyopathy, progressive worsening of renal function, and thromboembolic phenomena.
Clinical changes primarily treated as conditions separate from the underlying disease
may have a common origin of monoclonal gammopathy, which may present as amyloidosis and
multiple myeloma. <bold>(Dra. Bruna Affonso Madaloso)</bold>

      <title>Autopsy</title>
      <p>At autopsy, the heart was heavy and enlarged; however, the chambers appeared normal.
Microscopic examination showed that the primary disease was amyloidosis. This condition
affected the myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f06">Figure 6</xref>) and the
pericardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f07">Figure 7</xref>). In particular,
obstructions were observed in the vascular tree of both coronary arteries, leading to
the formation of areas of myocardial fibrosis. In addition, obstructions of the vessels
supplying the pulmonary artery, and the aorta (vessels of the <italic>vasa
vasorum</italic>) and of renal vessels were noted.</p>

      <p>To investigate amyloidosis, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of immunoglobulin
light chains. Kappa light-chain staining was negative and lambda light-chain staining
was positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f08">Figure 8</xref>), indicating that the
patient probably had multiple myeloma. Supporting this was the fact that he had
pancytopenia and systemic signs compatible with neoplasia. In the bone marrow sample
obtained at autopsy (rib, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f09">Figure 9</xref>), there was no
plasmacytic proliferation or amyloid deposition; however, we cannot completely rule out
the possibility that the disease was present in other locations.</p>

      <p>The course of progression of cardiac failure suggests that the primary reason may not be
amyloidosis. Possibly, the initial oligosymptomatic phase was caused by systemic
arterial hypertension with hypertensive myocardiopathy. Amyloidosis had a major role in
the worsening of the patient's condition and in the final outcome. Amyloid deposition
was very significant in vessel walls.</p>
      <p>In most cases, cardiovascular amyloidosis is usually diagnosed at autopsy<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. A few years ago, we reported that
&lt;50% cases were diagnosed before patients die<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. In particular, cardiac failure occurred in elderly patients and
in patients with other diseases, as was the case with the present patient<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Other difficulties include the absence
of low-voltage QRS complexes and the existence of systolic dysfunction. Hence,
amyloidosis is suspected in cases of unusual clinical and physiopathological patterns,
which normally involve younger patients; however, it occurs mostly in elderly patients
who have comorbid conditions.</p>
      <p>More than 20 proteins with anomalous conformation are known to form amyloid deposits. In
the heart, the most common proteins are transthyretin (especially in senile
cardiovascular amyloidosis) and light-chain amyloidosis (AL amyloidosis)<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. AL amyloidosis appears to be more
frequent; however, the number of cases of senile cardiovascular amyloidosis is
increasing as a result of the aging of the population<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. The prognosis of AL amyloidosis is worse than that of
senile cardiovascular amyloidosis<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.
In the present case, lambda light-chain staining showed that the disease was AL
amyloidosis, despite the patient's advanced age.</p>
      <p>Gammopathies leading to AL amyloidosis and multiple myeloma are plasmocyte dyscrasias,
but the relationship between these conditions is not direct. Only 10%-15% patients with
myeloma exhibit amyloid deposition. The reverse, i.e., the number of patients with
amyloidosis who present myeloma, has been less analyzed. A study conducted with 46
patients with amyloidosis in several organs (83% with cardiac involvement) showed that
57% of them met the criteria for myeloma<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. In the case of our patient, because amyloidosis was not clinically
suspected, tests for multiple myeloma were not conducted. The bone marrow sample
analyzed during autopsy did not exhibit plasmocyte proliferation; however, we cannot
completely rule out the possibility that the disease was present in other locations.</p>
      <p>Although amyloid deposition in the pericardium has been described<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, it is uncommon.</p>
      <p>Pulmonary thromboembolism is the most frequent cause of death without diagnosis. In a
survey conducted in our hospital<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, it
accounted for 34% of the cases in which there were discrepancies between diagnoses and
the autopsy findings.</p>
