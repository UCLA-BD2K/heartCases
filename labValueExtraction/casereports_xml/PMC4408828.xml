        <p>Aneurysm of the descending aorta associated with CoA is an extremely rare congenital
abnormality. In this report, we present a 16 months old female patient in whom
cardiac catheterization had been performed which had revealed a segment of
coarctation and saccular aneurysm in the descending aorta. The patient was operated
and a 3x2 centimeters aneurysm which embraces the coarcted segment in descending
aorta was resected. In summary, we present a case of saccular aortic aneurysm distal
to aortic coarctation in an infant without any history of intervention or vascular
inflammatory disease. Our case report seems to be the youngest patient in literature
with this pathology.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is defined as the hemodynamically significant narrowing
of the descending thoracic aorta, usually just distal to the left subclavian artery
where the ligamentum arteriosum originates<sup>[<xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. CoA accounts for 6.5% of all congenital heart defects<sup>[<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. CoA is usually classified into three
categories: I.Isolated CoA, II. CoA with ventricular septal defect (VSD) and III. CoA
with complex cardiac anomalies<sup>[<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.
Aneurysm of the descending aorta associated with CoA is an extremely rare congenital
abnormality. In this report, we present the youngest patient per our literature search
with CoA and saccular descending aortic aneurysm.</p>

      <title>CASE PRESENTATION</title>
      <p>A 16 months old female patient was admitted to our clinic with diagnosis of aortic
coarctation and descending aortic aneurysm. She presented with poor feeding and failure
to thrive (body weight: 8 kg). The prenatal and postnatal history was unremarkable; any
umbilical vascular catheterization was not performed. Physical examination revealed 80
mmHg systolic pressure difference between upper and lower extremities. Femoral pulses
were weak but palpable. There was a systolic murmur (3/6) at the left sternal border
which was also heard at the interscapular area. The leukocyte count, C-reactive protein
level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were all within normal limits. The patient had
been admitted to another clinic a few months ago and transthoracic echocardiography had
demonstrated aortic coarctation with 60mmHg peak systolic gradient. Any intracardiac
pathology had not been encountered. Cardiac catheterization had been performed in order
to confirm the diagnosis and perform a balloon angioplasty if possible; however the
catheterization had revealed a segment of coarctation and saccular aneurysm in the
descending aorta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, the
patient was referred to our clinic for surgical repair.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The patient was operated under general anesthesia and a left posterolateral thoracotomy
was performed at the 4<sup>th</sup> intercostal space. A 3x2 cm aneurysm which embraces
the coarcted segment in descending aorta was encountered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). Descending aorta was mobilized, resection and end-to-end
anastomosis was performed with 6/0 polyprolene suture. The sutures were continuous at
the posterior wall, whereas they were interrupted at the anterior wall of the
anastomosis, in order to provide potential for growth. Residual gradient was less than 5
mmHg. The resected specimen was examined by the pathology department. Gross and
microscopic cross sectional examination of the coarctation area revealed the segments of
both coarctation and aneurysm formation. Basophilic degeneration and vacuole formation
were remarkable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>). The postoperative
period was uneventful and the patient was discharged at the sixth postoperative day
without any complication. At the sixth postoperative month, a second intervention was
performed because of recoarctation. The MR angiography revealed a recoarctation at the
descending aorta, in which balloon dilatation was performed with a residual gradient of
25 mmHg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3</xref>). The patient is followed up by
echocardiographic evaluations with regular intervals.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Surgical repair of CoA mostly depends on the accompanying cardiac anomalies in the
patient. The main treatment target is providing a non stenotic aortic continuity with
efforts to enhance the growth potential of the native vascular tissues, with or without
the repositioning of the left subclavian artery<sup>[<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Although rarely seen, aortic wall pathology such as aneurysm
formation, aortic dissection and rupture are mainly the presenting symptoms of adult
CoA. When pediatric age group is concerned, the saccular aortic aneurysms distal to
coarcted segment are very rare and data about these patients are only confined to
limited case reports<sup>[<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Our case
report seems to be the youngest patient in literature with this pathology. In such
cases, recoarctation may be encountered in the follow up which may be managed by
percutaneous balloon dilatation as presented in our case. Extensive mobilization of the
aorta and its branches with a meticulous surgical technique is mandatory in order to
reduce the tension at the anastomosis site.</p>
      <p>In summary, we present a case of saccular aortic aneurysm distal to aortic coarctation
in an infant without any history of intervention or vascular inflammatory disease. We
speculate that localized weakness of the aortic wall may be responsible for aneurysm
formation, since basophilic degeneration and vacuole formation were remarkable at the
transition zone between the coarcted and aneurysmatic segments under microscope.</p>
