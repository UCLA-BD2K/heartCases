        <p>The authors present a case of occupational lung damage from exposure to dust
containing aluminium. The first detected objective pathological finding was that of
dispersed micronodules in the lungs seen in a chest radiograph. The final diagnosis of
pulmonary aluminosis was established after three years of gradual exclusion of other
interstitial lung diseases. The diagnosis was supported by the occupational history
confirmed by hygiene assessment of the patient&#x2019;s workplace and especially by histological
examination with elemental analysis of the lung tissue. The possibility of development of
this rare condition should not be underestimated in workers at high-risk jobs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The term &#x201C;aluminium lung&#x201D; was first used by Goralewski in the 1940s<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the current literature, there
are no arguments about the existence of lung damage from inhalation exposure to dust
containing aluminium particles or compounds, the so-called aluminosis. Pulmonary aluminosis
is defined as pneumoconiosis caused by the presence of dust containing aluminium in the lung
tissue<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The condition is
clinically significant in that it may result in pulmonary fibrosis. There were reports of
cases of death even after few years from the onset of symptoms, e.g. after 3 or
5&#x2005;yr<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>Radiographic findings may vary considerably, showing nodular or slightly irregular
opacities that may merge into more prominent formations, most frequently in the upper lung
fields<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some authors also reported their distribution in the lower
lung fields<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> or, less frequently, a diffuse
micronodular pattern<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, as seen in our
patient. Possible mediastinal enlargement was also mentioned by some authors<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In advanced stages, severe
pulmonary fibrosis with honeycombing was described<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>As in other pneumoconioses, there is no effective targeted therapy for aluminosis.</p>

      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>The patient was a 39-yr-old male non-smoker. His personal and family history was
unremarkable, the only exception being pulmonary sarcoidosis of his cousin.</p>
      <p>The first symptoms of the disease were noticed in September 2006 and included severe
exertional dyspnoea with non-productive cough. The patient was afebrile, with a BMI of
26.64. Otherwise, physical examination including lung auscultation showed no abnormalities.
At that time, a plain chest radiograph revealed numerous dispersed micronodules with
bilateral hilar enlargement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Patient&#x2019;s plain chest radiograph with numerous dispersed micronodules and bilateral
hilar enlargement.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="indhealth-52-147-g001"/></fig>). Gallium
scintigraphy showed bilateral hilar lymph node enlargement and diffuse uptake of the
radiopharmaceutical in both lungs. An HRCT scan of the lungs showed diffuse small foci and
enlarged intrathoracic lymph nodes. Bronchoalveolar lavage repeatedly showed no signs of
lymphocytic alveolitis considered in differential diagnosis. Spirometry results including
diffusing capacity were normal. As a part of the differential diagnosis of dyspnoea with
non-productive cough, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was performed and lung
biopsy specimens were obtained in October 2006. The surgically excised material was fixed in
10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Histological sections of 3&#x2013;4 &#x3BC;m were stained with
haematoxylin and eosin using the PAS (Periodic Acid Schiff) method, as described by Van
Gieson, Gomori and Perl. Immunohistochemistry tests were performed using a two-step indirect
method with antibodies against S-100 protein, CD68 and CD1a. Histologically, an exudative
and proliferative process was described in the lung tissue, with nodular histiocytic
infiltrates. The final diagnosis made at a local respiratory clinic was stage II to III
sarcoidosis. Systemic corticosteroids were administered for 10 months, until August 2007,
but with no therapeutic effect.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the histological preparation from the original VATS biopsy was reassessed in
November 2007 at the university hospital. The lung infiltrates were histiocytic and
non-granulomatous, different from well formed granulomas in sarcoidosis. No microcrystalline
particles were found and immunohistochemistry (CD68 positive, S-100 protein and CD1a
negative) was not consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. The interstitial fibrosis
was mild (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Perivascular and peribronchial histiocytic and non-granulomatous infiltrates in
collapsed lung tissue in a more detail (haematoxylin and eosin stain, 200 &#xD7;
magnification).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="indhealth-52-147-g002"/></fig>). Without detailed knowledge of
occupational history, the histopathologist established the diagnosis of non-Langerhans cell
histiocytosis suggestive of Erdheim-Chester disease.</p>
      <p>Corticoid therapy was reintroduced, this time together with cyclophosphamide. Although
Erdheim-Chester disease is a condition characterized by both skeletal and extraskeletal
lesions, no typical skeletal changes were seen in a December 2007 PET/CT scan. Bone lesions
were not even confirmed by three-phase bone scintigraphy a month later. Both PET/CT and HRCT
scans were only suggestive of multiple diffuse micronodules in the lungs.</p>
      <p>After another year of the above therapy, the patient&#x2019;s clinical condition remained
unchanged, with persisting exertional dyspnoea and non-productive cough. Small disseminated
lesions seen on a chest radiograph were unchanged, both pulmonary mechanics and diffusing
capacity were normal. No significant abnormalities were found by biochemistry, immunology
and haematology tests. Given the poor response to therapy and regarding the fact that
Erdheim-Chester disease was not clinically confirmed, the histological sample was assessed
for the third time in January 2009, using an electron microscope. The material for electron
microscopy was fixed with glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide and embedded in Epon.
Ultra-thin slices were stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate. Elemental analysis of
the sample was performed with the EDAX system for X-ray structural analysis. It revealed in
particular the presence of aluminium (later also iron pigments and their silicon compounds
including elements from the above fixing agents).</p>
      <p>The basic histiocytic morphology of the lung involvement and results of elemental analysis
corresponded with those in pneumoconiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig.
3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Electron microscope image of histiocytes with nuclei and ample, in part vacuolated
cytoplasm with depositions of electron-dense granular material. Microcrystalline
particles were not found. Fibrotic areas are also apparent.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="indhealth-52-147-g003"/></fig>).</p>
      <p>Subsequently, therapy with corticoids and cyclophosphamide was discontinued in April 2009.
A more detailed occupational history was taken which revealed that the patient had
approximately 10-yr occupational exposure to aluminium-containing dust. In his last job
between 2000 and 2006, he worked as an aviation mechanic, grinding and polishing aluminium
sheets.</p>
      <p>After the diagnosis of aluminosis was suspected, in order to classify the condition as an
occupational disease, occupational exposure had to be objectively verified at the patient&#x2019;s
workplace by industrial hygiene specialists.</p>
      <p>But there were several factors which made this hygienic assessment more difficult: the
patient&#x2019;s employer did not measure relevant risk factors associated with performing the job
of an aviation mechanic. Then the factory changed the owner and at the time when hygienic
assessment was performed, working conditions and technologies were different as well.
Because of that the exact measurement of the airborne concentrations of aluminium at the
workplace could not be accomplished. However, working conditions and time proportion of
particular working operations were specified on the basis of the information obtained from
patient&#x2019;s former factory supervisors and material specifications of the used aluminium
sheets.</p>
      <p>It was found that in his late job of an aviation mechanic, the patient was exposed to fine
aluminium dust. This was the most significant and massive exposure which resulted mainly
from machine grinding of aluminium materials (sheets containing as much as 92% of aluminium)
and their polishing with a hand-held drill and angle grinder. These activities accounted for
approximately 25% of his working time. An extremely dusty seasonal work was the so-called
airplane refurbishment, with sheet grinding including removal of anodic films accounting for
up to 80% of the working time.</p>
      <p>The hygienic conditions at the workplace were generally unsatisfactory. The place was only
naturally ventilated through windows and gates, with dust constantly raised. Personal
protective equipment was inadequate as simple cloth dust masks could not sufficiently
protect from exposure to fine aluminium dust.</p>
      <p>Thus, according to the industrial hygiene specialists&#x2019; statement, conditions in the
patient&#x2019;s workplace met the criteria for the development of an occupational disease.</p>
      <p>Later, approximately 5&#x2005;yr after the exposure was discontinued, increased aluminium
concentration in the patient&#x2019;s serum was also confirmed, reaching 656&#x2005;nmol/l (reference
range, 100&#x2212;400&#x2005;nmol/l).</p>
      <p>Gradual exclusion of previous suspected diagnoses (sarcoidosis, Erdheim-Chester disease), a
lack of response to therapy, the patient&#x2019;s occupational history and especially the
histological electron microscopy finding, together with increased serum aluminium level led
to the establishment of a diagnosis of pulmonary aluminosis. In 2011, the diagnosis was
recognized and the patient was compensated for an occupational disease.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The presented case documents differential diagnostic assessment of exertional dyspnoea and
non-productive cough with radiographically detected multiple dispersed micronodules in the
lungs. Apart from histological diagnosis using electron microscopy with elemental analysis
of tissue, the key role was played by a detailed occupational history objectively verified
by hygiene assessment and confirmation of occupational exposure to significant amounts of
fine aluminium dust.</p>
      <p>As early as in 1936, the effect of aluminium-containing dust inhalation on human health was
studied in Great Britain. At that time, however, the relationship between
aluminium-containing dust inhalation and pulmonary fibrosis was not found<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The first cases of lung damage
from exposure during aluminium processing were reported in the 1930s in Germany. In 1934,
Baader reported the first case ever of pulmonary fibrosis associated with the above
exposure, as mentioned in a 1938 study by Doese<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Then, in the 1940s, damage to the lungs from
aluminium-containing dust inhalation was extensively studied by Goralewski<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In 1960, Koelsch reported that
between 1943 and 1960, twenty-seven cases of pulmonary aluminosis were recognized and
compensated in Germany<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>Moreover, in the 1940s, thirty-five cases of pulmonary fibrosis were reported among 344
Canadian aluminium potroom workers with exposure in the manufacture of alumina abrasive. Of
those, ten died due to respiratory failure<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>Traditionally, the highest risk with respect to potential lung damage is associated with
processes in bauxite smelting, the use of fine aluminium powder in the manufacture of
explosives, and aluminium welding<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some studies reported occasional cases of aluminosis from
grinding and polishing of aluminium materials, similar to the presented case<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>In 1986, De Vuyst and colleagues published a case of a metal polisher doing his job for
24&#x2005;yr, using abrasives to polish aluminium materials mainly in the second half of his
exposure and developing a severe form of interstitial lung fibrosis with honeycombing and
emphysema<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Necropsy
findings revealed a diffuse interstitial fibrosis with increased collagen and moderate
infiltration with mononuclear cells. Electron microscopy revealed alveolar and septal
macrophages exhibiting phagolysosomes with electron-dense content. Elemental analysis of
BAL, lung tissue and lymph node tissue samples confirmed aluminium as the most abundant
mineral<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, similarly to our
case.</p>
      <p>More recently, Kraus <italic>et al.</italic> in their 2006 article reported lung changes in
workers in two German plants producing aluminium powder who had been exposed to a mixture of
aluminium particles and various lubricants. The changes were detected by HRCT in 15 out of
62 workers, including 2 polishers<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>As summarized by Krewski <italic>et al.</italic> histological findings in aluminosis are
most typical for the presence of pulmonary fibrosis of various extent and in many cases
confirmed presence of particles containing aluminium<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Both of these were confirmed in our case. But sporadic
findings such as extensive interstitial granulomas were described as well<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>There have been extensive discussions in the literature regarding the pathophysiological
basis of aluminosis and many authors asked what is behind the ability of aluminium to cause
lung tissue fibrosis. A range of potential influencing pathophysiological and environmental
factors were studied: existence of fibrous particles of alpha aluminium oxide<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, the role of aluminium oxides and
their low temperature transitional forms (such as gamma aluminium oxide)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> or the impact of processing aluminium powder, namely the
role of additives and lubricants<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other authors suppose that an important and dangerous role
is played by inhalation of fine dust with respirable aluminium particles sized 0.5&#x2212;5
<italic>&#xB5;</italic>m<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some of
these hypotheses were not supported, several authors concluded that the previous suggestions
relating aluminium-induced fibrosis to the presence of gamma aluminium oxide had not been
correct<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>However, the pathophysiology of pulmonary aluminosis has not been fully explained as
yet.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4">
      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Although pulmonary aluminosis is a very rare disease, it still occurs. Since the industrial
importance and use of aluminium continue to rise, lung damage from exposure to aluminium
should not be overlooked, from the perspective of both possible diagnostic considerations
and prevention. It is therefore desirable to monitor and minimize exposure to respirable
aluminium particles and to try to detect early stages of the disease as well.</p>
