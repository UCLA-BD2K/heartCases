          <title>Background:</title>
          <p>Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is uncommon; however, accurate diagnosis facilitates personalized management and informs prognosis in probands and relatives.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Objective:</title>
          <p>The objective of the study was to highlight that the appropriate use of genetic and nongenetic investigations leads to the correct classification of diabetes etiology.</p>

          <title>Case Discussion:</title>
          <p>A 30-year-old European female was diagnosed with insulin-treated gestational diabetes. She discontinued insulin after delivery; however, her fasting hyperglycemia persisted. &#x3B2;-Cell antibodies were negative and C-peptide was 0.79 nmol/L. Glucokinase (GCK)-MODY was suspected and confirmed by the identification of a GCK mutation (p.T206M).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods:</title>
          <p>Systematic clinical and biochemical characterization and <italic>GCK</italic> mutational analysis were implemented to determine the diabetes etiology in five relatives. Functional characterization of <italic>GCK</italic> mutations was performed.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results:</title>
          <p>Identification of the p.T206M mutation in the proband's sister confirmed a diagnosis of GCK-MODY. Her daughter was diagnosed at 16 weeks with permanent neonatal diabetes (PNDM). Mutation analysis identified two <italic>GCK</italic> mutations that were inherited in trans-p. [(R43P);(T206M)], confirming a diagnosis of GCK-PNDM. Both mutations were shown to be kinetically inactivating. The proband's mother, other sister, and daughter all had a clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, confirmed by undetectable C-peptide levels and &#x3B2;-cell antibody positivity. <italic>GCK</italic> mutations were not detected.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions:</title>
          <p>Two previously misclassified family members were shown to have GCK-MODY, whereas another was shown to have GCK-PNDM. A diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was confirmed in three relatives. This family exemplifies the importance of careful phenotyping and systematic evaluation of relatives after discovering monogenic diabetes in an individual.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for approximately 5% of all diabetes cases diagnosed before the age of 45 years (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). It is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, young age at onset, absence of &#x3B2;-cell autoimmunity and insulin resistance, and persistent endogenous insulin secretion (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In the United Kingdom, approximately 80% of cases are misdiagnosed as type 1 (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), reflecting limitations in physicians' awareness about MODY and access to genetic testing. Diagnosing MODY has significant implications for patients allowing optimal therapeutic management and informing on prognosis. Relatives also benefit from cascade-screening, which prevents further misdiagnosis. Nevertheless, MODY does not preclude the presence of different diabetes types in other family members.</p>
    <p>In this study, using the paradigm of a family with multiple diabetic members, we exemplify how the appropriate use of genetic and nongenetic methods facilitates accurate diabetes classification.</p>

      <p>Patient II-2 had a striking family history of diabetes; her mother (I-2) and one sister (II-4) were diagnosed with T1D at ages 32 and 11 years, respectively, and another sister (II-6) had a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The proband's daughter (III-1) was diagnosed with T1D at age 3 years, and her niece (III-4) had permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) diagnosed at 16 weeks.</p>
      <p>After an uncomplicated pregnancy, the proband delivered a healthy boy at 38 weeks and stopped insulin. Mild fasting hyperglycemia persisted after delivery.</p>
      <p>The differential diagnosis included T1D, consistent with the young age at onset and family history. However, the absence of symptoms at diagnosis, negative pancreatic autoantibodies, low insulin requirements throughout pregnancy (maximum 0.5 IU/kg &#xB7; d), and independence from insulin after delivery precluded T1D. The mild antenatal hyperglycemia and discontinuation of insulin after delivery was consistent with GDM, but normal body mass index, European ethnicity, diabetes presentation in early gestation, and persistent fasting hyperglycemia made GDM unlikely (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p>
      <p>She was subsequently referred to a specialized Diabetes Genetics Clinic for investigation. The phenotype suggested glucokinase (GCK)-MODY; therefore, a sequence analysis of the promoter, exon 1A, exons 2&#x2013;10, and flanking intronic regions of <italic>GCK</italic> was performed in a diagnostic genetics laboratory on an ABI 3730 capillary sequencer (Life Technologies, Applied Biosciences) and analyzed using Mutation Surveyor version 3.24 (BioGene) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). She was heterozygous for the previously reported pathogenic c.617C&gt;T; p.T206M mutation in <italic>GCK</italic>, thus confirming GCK-MODY (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p>
      <p>Subsequently, we implemented a systematic approach to investigate other diabetic family members and rule out misclassification. Furthermore, we performed functional analyses of the <italic>GCK</italic> mutations identified.</p>

        <title>Investigation of other diabetic family members</title>
        <p>We identified and reviewed all diabetic members of this family via a systematic approach using a detailed medical history, laboratory tests [fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and islet cell antibodies (ICA), C-peptide] and <italic>GCK</italic> sequencing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://press.endocrine.org/doi/suppl/10.1210/JC.2013-.3641/suppl_file/JC-13-3641.pdf">http://press.endocrine.org/doi/suppl/10.1210/JC.2013-.3641/suppl_file/JC-13-3641.pdf</ext-link> Supplemental Figure 1). Biochemical tests were performed in a routine laboratory. GAD antibodies were measured by a RIA using the <sup>35</sup>S-labeled full-length 65-kDa isoform of GAD, and the results were expressed in World Health Organization units per milliliter per an international standardized curve (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control code 97/550) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). <italic>GCK</italic> sequence analysis was performed as above.

        <title>Functional analysis of identified GCK mutations</title>
        <p>Glutathione S-transferase-tagged human wild-type and mutant GCK were generated, and GCK activity was measured spectrophotometrically using glucose 6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-coupled assays (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Glucose affinity was measured in 0&#x2013;100 mmol/L (WT-GCK) or 0&#x2013;1000 mmol/L (R43P-GCK, T206M-GCK) of glucose. ATP affinity was determined in 0&#x2013;5 mmol/L of ATP.</p>
        <p>Relative activity indices were normalized and calculated to a blood glucose of 90 mg/dL (5 mmol/L) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Predicted glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) thresholds were calculated (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Predicted pathogenicity for all variants was assessed using PolyPhen version 2.2.2 and Sorting tolerant from Intolerant (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Variants were mapped onto the crystal structure of human GCK bound to glucose (closed form; Protein DataBank entry 1V4S) using PyMOL version 0.99.</p>

        <title>Investigation of other diabetic family members</title>
        <p>II-6 was diagnosed with GDM in her second pregnancy and had similar phenotype to the proband. Sequencing analysis identified the <italic>GCK</italic> p.T206M mutation, confirming GCK-MODY (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Patient II6's daughter (III-4) was microsomic at birth (&#x2212;4 SD of the predicted mean weight for gestational age), failed to thrive, and was generally unwell until diagnosed with diabetes at 16 weeks after presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) complicated by cerebral edema. She was started on insulin. The diabetes severity was not consistent with GCK-MODY. <italic>GCK</italic> sequence analysis revealed that III-4 was heterozygous for the p.T206M mutation and also the c.128C&gt;G;p.R43P mutation (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), confirming GCK-PNDM.</p>
        <p>The proband's mother (I-2) was diagnosed with diabetes at age 33 years with osmotic symptoms and hyperglycemia. Insulin was initiated soon after diagnosis. An undetectable serum C-peptide (&lt;0.02 nmol/L) and positive anti-GAD antibodies confirmed T1D. No <italic>GCK</italic> mutations were detected.</p>
        <p>Subject II-4 (the proband's other sister) was diagnosed with diabetes at age 13 years with osmotic symptoms, weight loss, and ketonuria. Insulin was commenced at diagnosis. C-peptide was undetectable, confirming T1D. A <italic>GCK</italic> mutation was not found.</p>
        <p>Subject III-1 (the proband's daughter) is the eldest of three children. Their unrelated father (II-1) has coincidental T1D. She was diagnosed with diabetes at age 3 years, after new-onset enuresis. At diagnosis, she was hyperglycemic without ketonuria and was started on insulin. Her postprandial urinary C-peptide to creatinine ratio was 0.006 nmol/mmol, consistent with T1D (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Given that the presence of a <italic>GCK</italic> mutation would not alter her current management and her parents did not wish for the investigation, genetic testing was not performed.</p>

        <title>Functional characterization of identified mutations</title>
        <p>Previous results on the kinetic properties of purified recombinant R43P- and T206M-GCK protein indicated reduced overall function (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>); however, to allow direct comparison of the impact of these two mutations on enzyme function, both mutant proteins were reanalyzed simultaneously. Accurate calculation of glucose affinity (S<sub>0.5</sub>) of R43P-GCK required a glucose concentration range 10 times greater than that for WT-GCK, yielding a glucose S<sub>0.5</sub> value 28 times greater than WT-GCK (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The catalytic activity of R43P-GCK was 0.005% compared with WT-GCK, indicating a severely inactivating mutation (Supplemental Table 1). T206M-GCK was essentially unresponsive to glucose, even at concentrations up to 18 000 mg/dl (1000 mmol/L); it was impossible to calculate the enzymes's S<sub>0.5</sub>, also indicating a severely inactivating mutation.</p>
        <p>Our empirical findings were supported by two in silico function-prediction programs, predicting p.R43P and p.T206M to be functionally deleterious. Moreover, 3-dimensional mapping of residues R43 and T206 on the human GCK crystal structure placed residue R43 within an &#x3B1;-helical structural motif and T206 deep within the glucose-binding pocket of GCK, confirming their importance in the enzyme's structure (Supplemental Figure 2).</p>
        <p>To explore the impact of these mutations on fasting plasma glucose levels, we used an established mathematical model and the kinetic characteristics of the mutant enzymes to predict the threshold for GSIS (Supplemental Table 1). Because we were unable to quantify the kinetic defect for p.T206M-GCK, to obtain the minimal threshold for GSIS in a compound heterozygote, we assumed a glucose affinity (S<sub>0.5</sub> value) for T206M-GCK at least as poor as R43P-GCK, provided that other enzyme characteristics remained unchanged. Under these assumptions, p.[R43P];[T206M] compound heterozygotes would not be predicted to reach the threshold for insulin release until glucose concentrations were in excess of 3330 mg/dL (185 mmol/L). This compares with a predicted GSIS threshold of 129.6 mg/dL (7.2 mmol/L) for a p.R43P heterozygote.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>To our knowledge, this is the first family reported with three different diabetes subtypes across three generations (GCK-MODY, GCK-PNDM, T1D) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Using a systematic approach incorporating clinical characteristics, laboratory testing, and <italic>GCK</italic> sequencing, we reclassified two family members with GCK-MODY (the proband and II-6 previously diagnosed with atypical diabetes and GDM, respectively) and gave a definitive diagnosis to four others; III-4 received a genetic diagnosis of GCK-PNDM, and in I-2, II-4, and III-1, T1D was confirmed. Moreover, we replicated previous functional studies for the identified <italic>GCK</italic> mutations, demonstrating that both result in severe loss of function.</p>
      <p>GCK is the key regulatory enzyme in glucose metabolism, controlling GSIS. Heterozygous inactivating mutations in <italic>GCK</italic> result in life-long mild, often subclinical, nonprogressive fasting hyperglycemia, by resetting the GSIS threshold to a higher level [99&#x2013;144 mg/dL (5.5&#x2013;8 mmol/L)] without affecting the total insulin secretion capacity. In GCK-MODY, patients are generally asymptomatic and are diagnosed incidentally or as part of diabetes screening (eg, during pregnancy). They do not develop microvascular diabetic complications (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>); therefore, treatment is not recommended outside pregnancy. This was explained to subjects II-2 and II-6, and no further follow-up in secondary care was arranged.</p>
      <p>Diabetes presenting in the first 6 months of life is not T1D, as evidenced by the absence of pancreatic autoantibodies and the presence of protective human leukocyte antigen haplotypes (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Neonatal diabetes is a rare condition (1 in 90 000&#x2013;260 000 births) (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), clinically and genetically heterogeneous, and can be transient or permanent (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Homozygous or compound heterozygous inactivating mutations in <italic>GCK</italic> represent a rare cause of PNDM; to date approximately 12 cases have been reported (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), mostly in consanguineous families. These cases present with intrauterine growth retardation and insulin-dependent diabetes from birth (or very soon after).</p>
      <p>Subjects II-2 and II-6 undoubtedly inherited the p.T206M mutation from their father, who is not known to have diabetes, but would have fasting hyperglycemia if tested. The p.R43P mutation in III-4 could either have arisen de novo or be of paternal origin. Her father is not known to have hyperglycemia and was unavailable for further evaluation. These unaffected family members should be counseled on the possibility of fasting hyperglycemia being identified upon incidental testing and of the availability of confirmatory genetic testing to avoid mislabeling as type 2 diabetes.</p>
      <p>Finally, discussions between physicians, pediatricians, a clinical geneticist, and family members took place regarding the management of the three unaffected children (III-2, III-3, III-5). Their 50% risk of inheriting the p.T206M mutation and having GCK-MODY, and additionally for III-2's and III-3's high risk of developing T1D in the future, given the strong family history, were explained. A possible advantage of genetic testing would be to maximize the available information when assessing hyperglycemia in a hypothetical future scenario, particularly if negative for the <italic>GCK</italic> mutation. The parents decided to not proceed with either fasting glucose or <italic>GCK</italic> testing at present in the unaffected children.</p>
      <p>In summary, this family highlights the importance of systematically investigating family members of individuals with monogenic diabetes. Monogenic diabetes does not preclude other diabetes subtypes in relatives and vice versa, and definitive genetic status should be established for all affected individuals. Challenges regarding the genetic screening for GCK-MODY in unaffected family members often arise, especially in children, and we suggest that the final decision should involve these individuals or their parents, use genetic counseling expertise if necessary, and should be taken in the context of all potential implications.</p>
