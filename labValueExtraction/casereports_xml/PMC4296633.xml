        <p>Angle Class III malocclusion is characterized by an inadequate anteroposterior dental
relationship which may or may not be accompanied by skeletal changes. In general,
patients are distressed by a significantly compromised facial aspect which, when
associated with a deficient middle third, encourages patients to seek treatment. This
article reports a two-phase treatment carried out in a female patient aged six years
and six months with a tendency towards a Class III skeletal pattern. This case was
presented to the Brazilian Board of Orthodontics and Facial Orthopedics (BBO). It is
representative of the Discrepancy Index (DI) category, and fulfills part of the
requirements for obtaining BBO Diploma.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>This report describes the case of a healthy female patient presented for treatment at
the age of six years and six months. Her medical and dental history was within the
normal range, with no history of illness or trauma. She had good oral hygiene and saw
her pedodontist every six months. Her parents' chief complaint was that her upper teeth
were positioned behind her lower teeth. The patient's father had Angle Class III
malocclusion with a skeletal Class III pattern as well. Given that his daughter's dental
arch resembled his own, he wanted her treatment to start as early as possible since he
had been informed that in so doing she might avoid future surgery, or at least minimize
it in case it was needed in adulthood.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>DIAGNOSIS</title>
      <p>Regarding her facial appearance, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure
1</xref>, the patient had good symmetry, slightly convex profile, lip competence,
slightly protruding lower lip and little exposure of upper incisors at speaking and
smiling. Dental examination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">2</xref>) revealed that the patient was in early mixed
dentition with distal relationship of the primary molars in straight terminal plane
while in the posterior region only tooth #16 had begun erupting. She presented with
anteroposterior disharmony between maxilla and mandible, and maxillary constriction
(atresia), resulting in a crossbite that extended from tooth #53 to #65. She also had a
deep curve of Spee, 3.3 mm overbite and 4 mm negative overjet. A decrease in eruption
spaces was also noted in teeth #12 and #22. The lower arch midline exhibited a 3.2 mm
deviation, and there were spaces in the lower arch which produced a positive 5-mm
discrepancy.</p>

      <p>In analyzing the panoramic radiograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig 3</xref>), it
was observed that all permanent teeth were present, indicting that bone and tooth
structures were within normal limits. Cephalometrically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Fig 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Tab 1</xref>), although the value
of the ANB angle was within normal range (ANB = 3.5&#xB0;), it could be verified through Wits
analysis (Wits = -3 mm) that the patient had a skeletal pattern tending towards Class
III. This fact, coupled with her unfavorable family history - given that the patient's
father had a dental and skeletal Class III pattern - reinforced the need for early
intervention. A growth pattern with vertical tendency (SN-GoGn = 36&#xB0;), severe axial
inclination of upper incisors towards palatal (1-NA = 0&#xB0;), and well positioned lower
incisors (NB-1 = 26&#xB0;) were also observed. It is noteworthy that mandibular manipulation
caused no change from centric relation to maximum and habitual intercuspation (MHI). In
calculating the Discrepancy Index (DI) a total of 18 points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig 5</xref>) was found.</p>

      <title>TREATMENT PLAN (PHASE 1)</title>
      <p>Planning involved a two-phase treatment. Initially, special attention would be given to
the skeletal disharmony between maxilla and mandible which, if left uncorrected, would
contribute significantly to the worsening of this condition during the whole process of
growth and development of the bony bases. Thus, the anterior and posterior crossbites
would be corrected, enlarging the maxilla in the transverse direction, thereby gaining
space in the anterior region for proper eruption of teeth #12 and #22.</p>
      <p>The patient and her parents would then be informed of the importance of compliance in
wearing the appliances and the need to perform treatment in two phases. In this first
phase, the patient was six years and six months old. The posterior crossbite would be
corrected using a modified Haas palate expansion appliance supported on the second
primary molars with acrylic covering the incisor surface of primary canines and occlusal
surfaces of primary molars . Additionally, hooks would be soldered to the buccal surface
of orthodontic bands fitted on second primary molars, combined with finger springs to
procline teeth #11 and #21.</p>
      <p>Maxillary protraction would be performed (a) to correct the anteroposterior discrepancy,
and (b) to procline the incisors with finger springs. This procedure would make use of
Hickham's chin cup. After this stage, the patient would be monitored every six months
until the ideal moment came to implement the second treatment phase.</p>
      <p>At this stage, no orthodontic appliance was placed in the patient's lower dental
arch.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>TREATMENT PROGRESS</title>
      <p>The modified Haas appliance was installed and the patient was instructed to make 1/4
turn activations every 12 hours for 15 days. After this period, the expander was
stabilized and the patient started to wear Hickham's chin cup with a force of 400 g on
each side for 16 hours/day for 11 months. After this period, the modified Haas appliance
was removed and the patient began being evaluated every six months.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="results">
      <title>RESULTS</title>
      <p>After analysis of the examinations carried out in planning the second treatment phase,
it was observed that the objectives proposed for the first phase had been fully
accomplished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f06">Figs 6</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Tab 1</xref>). From a dental
perspective, anterior and posterior crossbites were corrected, and consequently overbite
and overjet were also resolved, thus improving alignment. As planned, a pattern of Class
II molar relationship was attained through forward displacement of the maxilla, and
sufficient space for proper eruption of teeth #12 and #22.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="dpjo-19-04-0122-g10"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Cephalometrically, there was an increase in the ANB angle to 5&#xB0; (SNA = 82&#xB0; and SNB =
77&#xB0;) and a significant improvement in Wits value (Wits = 0 mm). This change was
especially due to displacement of the maxilla forward and downward, although there was a
slight counterclockwise rotation of the mandible (SN-GoGn increased from 36&#xB0; to 33&#xB0; and
FMA went from 21&#xB0; to 17&#xB0;).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>TREATMENT PLAN (PHASE 2)</title>
      <p>After four years monitoring patient's development with appointments every six months,
the second treatment phase started during the period of pubertal growth spurt, when the
patient was 11 years and 10 months old. The goals in this phase were to align and level
the teeth, achieving a perfect molar relationship and ultimately finishing the
treatment. After finishing, extraction of third molars would be indicated. To this end,
a preadjusted fixed orthodontic appliance, Roth prescription, 0.022 x 0.028-in slot
would be bonded to upper and lower dental arches. In the finishing stage, individualized
bends would be placed as required in stainless steel, 0.018 x 0.025-in archwires, and
intermaxillary elastics would be prescribed. After finishing, the retention phase would
begin with the use of a wraparound removable appliance placed in the upper arch and a
lingual canine-to-canine retainer in the lower arch.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>TREATMENT PROGRESS</title>
      <p>The upper arch received orthodontic bands with convertible triple tubes (0.051-in)
welded to them, placed on teeth #16 and #26. Thereafter, preadjusted metal brackets
(Roth prescription, 0.022 x 0.028-in slot) were bonded to upper incisors for alignment
and leveling with the aid of Twistflex 0.018-in wire and stainless steel 0.016-in and
0.018-in wire, with expansion loop. After slight flaring of incisors, brackets were
bonded to upper canines and premolars.</p>
      <p>As of his moment, straight archwires made with 0.016-in, 0.018-in and 0.020-in were
used. Eighteen months into treatment, teeth #17 and #27 erupted and were included in
alignment and leveling of teeth. Upon finishing, as planned, rectangular 0.018 x
0.025-in stainless steel archwires were formed, torqued and individually coordinated as
needed.</p>
      <p>Orthodontic bands with convertible rectangular double tubes were fitted to teeth #36 and
#46 in the lower arch, and 20 months into treatment, brackets were bonded to teeth #37
and #47. Alignment and leveling was performed using 0.018-in twist-flex archwires and
round 0.016-in, 0.018-in and 0.020-in stainless steel archwires. The case was finished
with 0.018 x 0.025-in rectangular stainless steel archwires with form, torques and
coordination performed as needed on an individual basis. Class II intermaxillary
elastics in Class II direction were also employed to decrease lower anchorage and thus
achieve a perfect molar relationship. After performing this step, positions of maximum
habitual intercuspation (MHI), centric relation and functional guidances (right and left
laterality, and protrusion) were verified.</p>
      <p>After ensuring that all planned objectives had been achieved, upper and lower fixed
orthodontic appliances were removed and the retention phase began. In this phase, a
removable wraparound appliance was fitted in the upper dental arch with a buccal
0.032-in stainless steel arch. The patient was instructed to wear it 24/7 for 18 months.
After this period, she would wear it 12 hours a day for six months, then only at
nighttime for another six months. At the end of this period, the case would be assessed
to determine whether or not to suspend its use altogether. In the lower arch, a round
0.018-in stainless steel fixed canine-to-canine retainer was bonded permanently to the
lingual surfaces of teeth #33 through #43.</p>

      <title>RESULTS</title>
      <p>At the end of treatment, additional exams were required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f11">Figs 11</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f14">14</xref>). They revealed that
results were very favorable as all objectives were clearly achieved. Concerning the
facial features, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f11">Figure 11</xref>, the smile
exhibits an adequate exposure of upper incisors, and the lower lip is parallel to the
upper teeth, displaying an excellent smile arc. Balanced facial symmetry and lip
competence can also be observed. In analyzing the profile, it appears that despite an
overall harmony, the mandible still shows slight protrusion.</p>

      <p>In examining the teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f11">Figs 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f12">12</xref>), it was observed that proper alignment and
leveling were achieved, as well as proper occlusion with a perfect relationship between
upper and lower molars, and between the upper and lower canines, on both sides.
Overbite, overjet, posterior crossbite and lower midline were corrected. The spaces in
the lower dental arch were closed and proper intercuspation obtained. There was an
increase in intercanine and intermolar widths in both dental arches. In the upper arch,
the intercanine width was 25 mm to 36 mm, and intermolar width 41 mm to 51 mm. In the
lower arch, the intercanine width was 20 mm to 29 mm, and intermolar width 39 mm to 44
mm. Functional harmony was attained in protrusive position, as well as right and left
laterality and the centric relation coincided with the intercuspid position. It is
noteworthy that all these results were achieved with only mild apical remodeling. No
sign of significant root resorption was observed at the end of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f13">Fig 13</xref>).</p>

      <p>As expected, several skeletal changes were observed. Mandibular growth occurred in the
anterior direction, which caused a decrease in the ANB angle from 3.5&#xB0; to 1&#xB0; while the
SNA angle remained unchanged and the SNB angle rose from 77.5&#xB0; to 80&#xB0;. The vertical
dimension was controlled, with a significant decrease in the mandibular plane angle
(SN-GoGn changed from 36&#xB0; to 29&#xB0; and FMA from 21&#xB0; to 17&#xB0;). These data can be viewed in

      <p>Cephalometric total superimpositions revealed that the maxilla and mandible moved
forward and downward. Partial maxillary superimpositions during the first phase showed
vertical development of the alveolar process in the molars, and a substantial change in
the inclination of upper incisors. In the second phase, molar mesialization and
extrusion were observed along with mild flaring and extrusion of incisors. Partial
mandibular superimpositions during the first phase showed mesialization and extrusion of
molars, with flaring and extrusion of incisors. In the second phase, molar extrusion and
incisor uprighting were noted.</p>

      <title>FINAL CONSIDERATIONS</title>
      <p>Diagnosis and treatment planning of Class III malocclusion should be performed
judiciously. Moreover, patients and their families should be made aware of the entire
process as results can be unpredictable. Even if goals and a success rate have been
established, the prognosis is unclear, since it depends largely on case development and
patient compliance. Even so, it is likely that once patient's growth has ended the need
for retreatment by dental compensation<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> or surgical intervention may still exist.<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
      <p>No consensus has yet been reached in the literature regarding the ideal time to start
treatment since some authors posit that growth and development of the craniofacial
complex is genetically determined, and therefore unalterable. For these authors,
correction of most Class III cases necessarily involves surgery. Furthermore,
orthodontic treatment should be started immediately after the growth spurt period has
ceased. Other authors however - although agreeing with the role of heredity in the
etiology of Class III - believe they can change growth pattern and direction by means of
a non-surgical approach capable of minimizing the malocclusion or even treating it
successfully.<sup>2</sup> When the patient is in the phase that precedes the pubertal
growth spurt, early treatment is indicated given that Class III malocclusions tend to
become increasingly severe over time; the reason being that mandibular growth remains
active for a longer period than maxillary growth.<sup>2,3</sup> Treatment of the case
reported here was conducted in two phases. It was initiated when the patient was six
years and six months old. Younger individuals tend to achieve more favorable results
between four and ten years of age, although patients whose ages range from 10 to 14
years old also present positive results.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In the first phase, rapid maxillary expansion was combined with maxillary protraction
using Hickham's<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> chin cup. This device
is easy to fabricate and individualize. It has met with wide acceptance by patients,
besides being more stable, especially during sleep.<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Although there are several types of appliances for orthopedic
protraction of the maxilla, the literature contains no studies comparing their
efficiency. The skill of the professional handling the device and patient comfort are
important variables when choosing one of these appliances.<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The second treatment phase began in late mixed dentition. At this stage, there was large
overcorrection, and the patient was in Angle Class II malocclusion. Furthermore, the
mandible was slightly retruded, which is indicated in this case since she would
otherwise continue to present with an unfavorable growth pattern.<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> At this stage, a conventional fixed
orthodontic appliance was used. Treatment outcome was very favorable, both functionally
and esthetically. Upper arch expansion, which had been performed in the first phase, was
stable, indicating that the morphological limits were respected. Dental alignment and
leveling were achieved in the second stage. Canine and molar occlusion was well
established and anterior and posterior crossbites corrected,<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> with pleasing facial esthetics, good symmetry and
adequate exposure of the upper incisors.</p>
