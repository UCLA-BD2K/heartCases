      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Eczema herpeticum (EH), a form of Kaposi's varicelliform eruption, is a secondary disseminated infection of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the setting of eczematous skin diseases, usually atopic dermatitis (AD). HSV-1 is more common in EH than HSV-2.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> EH occurs with an incidence of 3% to 6% of infants with AD.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Children, &lt;3 years of age, are reported to be at the highest risk of developing EH with an equal male&#x2013;female ratio.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> We saw a case of this disease in an infant and related its clinical features.</p>

      <title>Case report</title>
      <p>A 9-month-old boy, weighing 8&#x200A;kg, was presented to our outpatient department of dermatology with a sudden onset of monomorphic vesicles on the head, right lower leg, and both hands 4 days earlier. The infant has a 7-month history of AD, which mainly involved in the areas of his head and face. The infant suddenly exhibited a fever (39&#x2013;40&#x200A;&#xB0;C) 7 days earlier and was treated with intravenous cefoperazone and dexamethasone (5&#x200A;mg/d) on suspicion of AD complication and bacterial infection. A rash appeared on the third day of treatment and was considered by the infant's primary physician to be an exacerbation of AD and continued for 4 additional days of the former treatment until the eruption got worse. On physical examination, the infant had a temperature of 38.7&#x200A;&#xB0;C and diffuse, erythematous, vesicles on the head, face, arms, and hands. The regions on the head and face had crusted. Some yellow crusts were noted on the top area of head as the residual sign of AD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). Vesicles in multiple phases appeared on the back of both arms and hands (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). His serum HSV IgG antibody was positive, whereas IgM was negative. Based on the clinical features, the infant was initially diagnosed with EH and prescribed oral valacyclovir (Glaxo Wellcome, SA) 125&#x200A;mg 2 times daily and compound glycyrrhizin capsules 1 tablet/d. Wet dressing (0.1% acyclovir eye drops) was applied to the region 2 times daily. The samples of vesicles and crusts were taken for further confirmation as we previously described.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Observation of the blister wall with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed numerous viral particles within the keratin fibers and the nucleus of keratinocyte (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The vesicle fluid and crust were positive for HSV-2-specific DNA, whereas negative for HSV-1 on the real-time PCR (Light Cycler 2.0, Roche Diagnostics Corporation, USA) with HSV fluorescence assay kit (Da An gene Co., Ltd, China). After 4 days of treatment, the infant's condition had improved markedly with all vesicles crusted and his temperature returned to normal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A and B). Then the antiviral regimen was continued for another 5 days. The herpetic lesions had almost cleared by the seventh day of the start of the treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A and B). But the infant's parents reported that valacyclovir was only taken for the first 4 days as they worried about possible side effect of the antiviral agent. Meanwhile, they increased the frequency of wet dressing to 4 times daily without the occurrence of contact sensitization. In the follow up of 6 months later, there had been no recurrence.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>EH is characterized by the sudden onset of disseminated, monomorphic, and dome-shaped vesicles, generally associated with fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy. Very often, the herpetic eruptions start in the areas affected by AD, such as the head, hands, and the upper body regions and also can spread to involve the normal skin from 7 to 10 days.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Within 2 weeks, the blisters begin to dry out, crust, and form erosive pits that heal without scarring during 2 to 6 weeks.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> The diagnosis of EH is made mainly based on clinical manifestations. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can rapidly identify the HSV with high sensitivity and specificity as well as type the herpes virus, whereas TEM can reveal the location and morphologic features of virus particles in the infected cells. The finding of viral type-specific DNA or viral particles respectively by the two methods from blister fluid and viral culture can confirm the disease. Immunofluorescence testing has diagnostic value as well.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup></p>
      <p>Clinically, EH is easy to be misdiagnosed as an exacerbation of the patient's underlying chronic eczematous skin conditions with dire sequelae. Feye et al<sup>[5]</sup> reported a 38-year-old man with EH in setting of long-standing AD was misdiagnosed as an exacerbation of his primary dermatitis. Systemic application of high-dose corticosteroids resulted in progression of his ocular HSV-1 infection to bilateral keratitis, which can result in scarring and blindness.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Additionally, missing the diagnosis of EH, frequently seen in pediatric patients with AD, can lead to disseminated cutaneous and systemic infections of herpes simplex, which may be accompanied by bone marrow suppression and disseminated intravascular coagulation which resulted in the death of an infant.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> In our case, failure, at the earlier stage, to recognize the occurrence of EH in the setting of AD led to systemic steroid therapy for a week causing the spread of the herpes simplex. Therefore, it is imperative to improve the alertness to EH and recognize the link between chronic dermatitis and the potential herpetic infection.</p>
      <p>In treatment, the introduction of effective antiviral agents is the paramount regime. Presently, acyclovir is the most potent drug for pediatric patients with EH. There are no clear guidelines outlining the management of those patients, specifically, which patients should be hospitalized to receive IV acyclovir therapy and which can be managed as outpatients using oral acyclovir.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> A retrospective cohort study involving 79 patients aged 0 to 18 years with EH revealed either oral acyclovir, IV and oral acyclovir, or IV acyclovir alone were effective to EH of various severities.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> In children, usually intravenous acyclovir (15&#x2013;30&#x200A;mg/kg/d, divided 3 times daily for 7&#x2013;10 days) is applied to severe cases, whereas the oral acyclovir is administered in mild cases. The recommended dosage for oral acyclovir is 30 to 60&#x200A;mg/kg/d, divided into 3 doses/d for 10 days.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> The clinical utility of acyclovir, however, is limited by its low oral bioavailability and need for frequent dosing.</p>
      <p>Valacyclovir, an <sc>l</sc>-valyl ester prodrug of acyclovir, can be almost completely converted to acyclovir by liver and intestinal valacylovirase after oral administration.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Its mechanism of action, antiviral spectrum, and resistance are the same as acyclovir, whereas its oral bioavailability is superior to acyclovir. With an oral bioavailability &#x223C;3- to 5-fold greater than oral acyclovir, valacyclovir can be administered less frequently and can achieve the plasma acyclovir concentrations similar to those seen with intravenous acyclovir in adults.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Among children (3 months&#x2013;11 years of age) with HSV infection, multicenter studies indicate that the 20&#x200A;mg/kg dose of the formula of the oral valacyclovir can result in favorable acyclovir blood concentrations and is well tolerated.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> There are few reports on the efficacy of valacyclovir in the treatment of EH. In adults, Wollenberg et al<sup>[3]</sup> recommend a 7-day course of oral valacyclovir (500&#x200A;mg by mouth 3 times daily) for EH treatment, which can be prolonged according to the clinical course.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> In addition, glycyrrhizin, licorice root extract, has multiple pharmacologic effects like the anti-inflammatory activity and antiviral effect against <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> family viruses by inhibiting the replication of virus.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Application of this extract in the acute phase of EH not only can reduce the inflammation at legions, but also can strengthen the antiviral therapy.</p>
      <p>In summary, EH is a rare entity and the awareness for the sign of this herpes infection when diagnosing children with chronic skin disease should be increased. An exacerbation of atopic disease with a fever and sudden onset of vesiculopapular eruptions in a pediatric patient should raise a high suspicion of EH. Oral valacyclovir may be an effective and convenient treatment option for pediatric outpatients with EH.</p>
