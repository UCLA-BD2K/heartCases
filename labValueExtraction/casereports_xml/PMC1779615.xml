      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) is a sequela of pelvic inflammatory
disease (PID) that is comprised of an infectious, inflammatory complex
encompassing the fallopian tube and ovary. The proposed
pathophysologic mechanism for TOA development includes ascending
infection as well as hematogenous and lymphatic routes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].
The infectious source is typically polymicrobial and several
reports have identified <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>,
<italic>Neisseria gonorrhea</italic>, and <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>
and a variety of obligate anaerobic bacteria as commonly
associated microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>Cases of TOA involving endometriomas have been reported in the
literature, and women with revised American Society for
Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) stages III-IV endometriosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]
have been found to have an increased occurrence of TOA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].
<italic>E coli</italic> was more frequently cultured from aspirated
abscesses in women with concomitant endometriosis than if no
endometriosis was present. In addition, previous pelvic
surgery was found to increase the risk of TOA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. We report
a case of a woman with stage IV endometriosis with a TOA
involving an endometrioma, in the absence of cultured organisms,
who had evidence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) on normal saline wet
prep and culture.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="case">
      <title>CASE</title>
      <p>A 41-year old nulligravida presented to the University of Michigan
(UM) Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility clinic for an
evaluation of a six year history of primary infertility. Her prior
fertility evaluation and treatment history was significant for
four previous cycles of ovulation augmentation with clomiphene
citrate in conjunction with timed intercourse and a normal
hysterosalpingogram several years earlier. Her initial workup at
UM revealed normal ovarian reserve testing, normal values for TSH
and prolactin, and her husband's semen analysis was normal.
Transvaginal ultrasonography showed persistent bilateral
3.5 cm ovarian cysts that had a ground-glass appearance
consistent with endometriomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The patient underwent
laparoscopic evaluation due to the large endometriomas at which
time she was diagnosed with stage IV endometriosis. Due to dense
adhesive disease, the procedure was converted to an
exploratory laparotomy. Three right
ovarian endometriomas were removed, and the cyst wall of each was
excised with subsequent cauterization of the bases for hemostasis.
The left ovarian endometrioma was approached; however, it was not
removed due to severe adhesions and the patient's desire for
fertility. The patient's postoperative course was unremarkable.</p>
      <p>Five weeks after surgery, the patient underwent a
hysterosalpingogram which showed a normal uterine cavity, right
tubal patency, and left hydrosalpinx without spillage of dye. She
subsequently underwent two cycles of gonadotropins in conjunction
with intrauterine inseminations, but had suboptimal responses.</p>
      <p>Nine months after surgery, the patient presented to
the emergency room with fever and abdominal pain. Her temperature
was 38.7&#xB0;C. Her abdominal and pelvic exams showed
moderate tenderness, small amount of vaginal discharge and
bacterial vaginosis as evidenced by clue cells on a normal saline
wet prep. Gonorrhoeae and chlamydia cultures were obtained.
Transvaginal ultrasound showed a 7 cm left adnexal mass with
uniform echogenicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Her WBC was
16.7 K. She was admitted to the hospital for intravenous
antibiotic administration but despite broad-spectrum coverage,
high-grade fevers continued. On hospital day 3, after discussion
of risks, benefits, and alternatives that included conservative
management, she was consented for definitive surgical management
and underwent a modified radical hysterectomy with bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy and lysis of adhesions.</p>
      <p>Although all cervical, blood, and urine cultures were negative
on hospital admission, the left ovary contained an ovarian abscess
with gram negative rods within the left-sided endometrioma.
Gonorrhoeae and chlamydia cultures were negative. There was an
evidence of BV on normal saline wet prep and culture. Histology of
the left fallopian tube and ovary revealed an endometriotic cyst
with massive edema, hemorrhage, acute inflammation, and marked
eosinophilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) with an associated pyosalpinx
consistent with a TOA.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="comment">
      <title>COMMENT</title>
      <p>The development of TOA among women with endometriomas may be due
to an increased susceptibility to infection, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] particularly
in the altered immune environment seen with ectopic endometrial
glands and stroma, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] although there are no epidemiologic
data available to support this theory. Previous surgical
procedures involving the pelvic organs have been found to increase
the risk of TOA formation in patients with endometriosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].
Interestingly, in this case report, the patient's surgery took
place nine months prior to clinical presentation and the presence
of acute inflammatory cells in the endometrioma makes the
probability of a long incubation period or superinfection of a
chronic infectious process unlikely but not out of the realm of
possibility. There is one case report of a 7 month period of time
from surgery to superinfected endometrioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Similarly, in
terms of the timeframe of events, although an HSG performed in the
presence of an apparently dilated fallopian tube carries an
increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] this
patient's procedure was performed eight months prior to the onset
of her acute symptomatology and histologic findings. There was no
known change in partners since the patient's initial office visit
until the time of presentation with symptoms of acute pelvic
infection.</p>
      <p>Although the association between BV and the increased risk of an
ascending PID is well established, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] in the present case,
the finding of BV in the absence of isolated organisms on
cervical, blood, and urine cultures raises the question as to
whether BV that has ascended to the upper genital tract is a
predisposition to abscess formation in an endometrioma. More study
is necessary to investigate this matter and to elucidate whether
aggressive treatment of BV in patients with known advanced stage
endometriosis, akin to screening and treatment in patients who are
to undergo hysterectomy to prevent vaginal cuff abscesses, should
be considered to prevent super-infected endometriomas.</p>
