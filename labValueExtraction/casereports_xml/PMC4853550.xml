          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with neuroaxonal spheroids (HDLS) is a hereditary, adult onset leukodystrophy which is characterised by the presence of axonal loss, axonal spheroids and variably present pigmented macrophages on pathological examination. It most frequently presents in adulthood with dementia and personality change. HDLS has recently been found to be caused by mutations in the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (<italic>CSF1R</italic>) gene.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>In this study, we sequenced the <italic>CSF1R</italic> gene in a cohort of 48 patients from the UK, Greece and Ireland with adult onset leukodystrophy of unknown cause.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Five pathogenic mutations were found, including three novel mutations. The presentations ranged from suspected central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis to extrapyramidal to cognitive phenotypes. The case histories and imaging are presented here, in addition to neuropathological findings from two cases with novel mutations.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>We estimate that <italic>CSF1R</italic> mutations account for 10% of idiopathic adult onset leukodystrophies and that genetic testing for <italic>CSF1R</italic> mutations is essential in adult patients presenting with undefined CNS vasculitis or a leukodystrophy with prominent neuropsychiatric signs or dementia.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with neuroaxonal spheroids (HDLS) is an autosomal dominant, adult onset leukodystrophy which typically presents with early onset cognitive or personality change. It is characterised by a distinct neuropathological appearance consisting of axonal loss in the cerebral white matter, axonal spheroids and variably present pigmented microglia. In 2011, it was discovered that heterozygous mutations in the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (<italic>CSF1R</italic>) gene cause HDLS.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In addition, it was shown that pigmented orthochromatic leukodystrophy (POLD) is also caused by <italic>CSF1R</italic> mutations and that POLD and HDLS exist on a spectrum.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Previous studies have estimated that <italic>CSF1R</italic> mutations account between 10% and 25% of adult onset leukodystrophies, depending on the population studied.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
      <p>The clinical phenotype of patients with HDLS is variable, but the most common symptoms include cognitive decline, personality change and depression. Additional symptoms occur frequently and include parkinsonism, spasticity and seizures. Median age of onset is 45&#x2005;years, although patients with onset as young as 18 have been described. Median life expectancy is 6&#x2005;years but this is also variable, and some patients have survived for up to 29&#x2005;years after symptom onset.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p>
      <p>All mutations identified to date have been found in the tyrosine kinase domain of the protein (exons 12&#x2013;21) with exons 18, 19 and 20 containing the majority of the mutations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JNNP2015310788F1">figure 1</xref> and online supplementary table S1). CSF1R is a cell surface receptor that is highly expressed on cells of the myeloid lineage including the microglia of the central nervous system (CNS).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> It is activated by the cytokines colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) and interleukin-34. The receptor consists of an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Binding of CSF1 to the CSF1R receptor results in receptor homodimerisation and the autophosphorylation of a number of tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain. This is followed by activation of several signalling pathways including Src,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> AKT, Erk and phospholipase C-&#x3B3;.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> CSF1R activation therefore regulates microglial survival, proliferation and differentiation.</p>

        <title>Patients</title>
        <p>Patients with adult onset (&gt;16&#x2005;years) leukodystrophy of unknown cause were recruited non-consecutively from the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London; University College Cork, Ireland; St Vincent's University Hospital, Ireland; and Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, as part of the inception cohort of the adult onset leukodystrophy group multidisciplinary clinical service.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The main inclusion criterion was MRI white matter abnormalities consistent with leukodystrophy, that is, symmetric confluent T2 hyperintensity but excluding those with asymmetric/atypical features more likely associated with small vessel disease or multiple sclerosis. All patients had MRI and routine biochemical (including very long chain fatty acids), haematological, infectious and immune screening. Informed consent was obtained for genetic research sequencing and the project was carried out with institutional ethical approval from all centres.</p>

        <title>Genetic analysis</title>
        <p>The <italic>CSF1R</italic> gene was sequenced in all 48 patients as follows. The entire coding region of <italic>CSF1R</italic> was PCR-amplified using flanking intronic primers (primer sequences available on request). The PCR product was purified and then sequenced in both directions using Big Dye Terminator V.3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing products were purified and read on an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were analysed using Seqscape V.3 software (Applied Biosystems). Variants are described with reference to Ensembl Transcript ENST00000286301 of the <italic>CSF1R</italic> gene.

        <p>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was cut to 4&#x2005;&#xB5;m thick sections (14&#x2005;&#xB5;m for Luxol fast blue), mounted on glass slides and stained with routine H&amp;E, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Luxol fast blue/cresyl violet histochemical stains. Sections were examined by immunohistochemistry with the following antibodies: glial fibrillar acid protein (GFAP) (polyclonal, 1:2500, Dako), phosphorylated neurofilaments (clone SMI31, 1:5000, Sternberg), neurofilament cocktail (clone 2F11, 1:500, Dako/Cappel), myelin basic protein (clone SMI94, 1:2000, Sternberger), amyloid precursor protein (clone 22C11, 1:800, Chemicon/Millipore), amyloid-&#x3B2; (clone 6F3D, 1:100, Dako), ubiquitin (polyclonal, 1:1200, Dako), p62 (3/P62LCK Ligand, 1:100, BD Transduction), &#x3B1;-synuclein (clone KM51, 1:50, Leica/Novocastra), hyperphosphorylated &#x3C4; (clone AT8, 1:1200, INNOGENETICS), TDP-43 (clone 2E2-D3, 1:3000, Abnova), CD68 (clone PG-M1, 1:100, Dako), CD3 (LN10, 1:100, Leica/Novocastra), CD20 (clone 7D1, 1:200, Dako). Immunohistochemistry was carried out on a BondMax autostainer (Leica Microsystems) using 3,3-diaminobenzidine as chromogen. Appropriate positive controls were used for all immunohistochemical studies. Negative controls were treated identically except that the primary antibody was omitted. Negative control sections were examined for pigment deposits under bright light, including assessment of digital negative image with total inversion of the light (LEICA SCN400 scanner at &#xD7;40magnification and 65% image compression setting (LEICA UK)).</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>We sequenced the <italic>CSF1R</italic> gene in the 48 patients presenting with adult onset leukodystrophy of unknown cause from the UK, Greece and Ireland and identified five patients carrying mutations in the gene (including 3 novel mutations), indicating that <italic>CSF1R</italic> mutations account for approximately 10% of adult onset leukodystrophies in our cohort. A summary of identified mutations and clinical spectrum is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="JNNP2015310788TB1">table 1</xref>. Sequence alignment and in silico pathogenicity predictions for the novel V596M, A763P and E825K mutations are provided in online supplementary figure S1. We did not identify any discriminating clinical feature that could predict whether a CSF1R mutation would be found (see online supplementary table S2 for a summary of the negative cases).</p>

        <title>Case 1</title>
        <p>This patient had struggled at school with learning difficulties and developed sensory symptoms in the limbs at age 25&#x2005;years. She was involved in a car accident at age 31&#x2005;years, following which she developed mild cognitive symptoms and executive dysfunction. By age 35&#x2005;years, there was progressive immobility, cognitive decline and urinary incontinence. Aged 36&#x2005;years she rapidly deteriorated over a 3-month period, with anarthria, loss of mobility and worsening dementia. Her father had died of motor neuron disease aged 65&#x2005;years after an 18-month illness. Her mother had been treated for alcoholism and was still alive with a number of physical and cognitive problems.</p>
        <p>Examination revealed a supranuclear gaze palsy and a brisk jaw jerk. There was an asymmetric spastic quadriparesis and left-sided inattention. She was abulic with a frontal subcortical pattern of cognitive impairment. Mini-Mental State Examination was 8/30.</p>
        <p>Neuroimaging: The first MRI of the brain at age 31&#x2005;years was reported as showing an acute parietal infarct with restricted diffusion; however, subsequent imaging showed progressive extensive signal change with patches of restricted diffusion and volume loss in the superficial and deep white matter with relative sparing of the subcortical U fibres (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JNNP2015310788F2">figure 2</xref>). There was disproportionate volume loss and T2-weighted hyperintensity of the splenium of the corpus callosum extending to the posterior limb of both internal capsules and corticospinal tracts at the level of the mid brain. There was no abnormal contrast enhancement and MR angiogram was normal. These imaging findings were thought to be suspicious for cerebral vasculitis.</p>

The number of lesions showing restricted diffusion raised the possibility of central nervous system vasculitis. Case 2 imaged at age 48 shows extensive white matter hyperintensities on FLAIR (E) and T2-weighted imaging (F and G).

Sparse numbers of PAS and CD68 positive pigmented cells were evident in the white matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JNNP2015310788F3">figure 3</xref>F, K, L). Immunostaining for GFAP revealed severe reactive stellate and chronic fibrillar astrogliosis in the subcortical white matter and to a lesser extent in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JNNP2015310788F3">figure 3</xref>B). In spite of frequent axonal spheroids, myelin pallor or significant reduction in density of axons were not apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JNNP2015310788F3">figure 3</xref>C, D).

        <title>Case 2</title>
        <p>This patient presented at age 47&#x2005;years with a 2-year history of depression and personality change, including increasing use of illicit drugs. He made reckless financial decisions and became violent at home. Progressive cognitive deterioration followed and within 2&#x2005;years of presentation he required long-term care. He developed frequent generalised seizures following a right frontal brain biopsy and gradually became mute and uncommunicative. There was no family history of similar illness.</p>
        <p>On examination, there was upper limb apraxia and a parkinsonian gait with prominent freezing. Later examination findings included severe rigidity in the left upper limb, a rest tremor and stimulus-sensitive myoclonus. Eye movements were affected by slow saccades, visual impersistance and a mild vertical supranuclear gaze palsy.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p><italic>CSF1R</italic> mutations are part of a small but growing list of microglia-associated neurodegenerative diseases. While early reports suggested that the mutations had a dominant-negative effect, it has now been shown that <italic>CSF1R</italic> mutations are loss of function. Mutant CSF1R is expressed on the cell surface and can bind CSF1, form dimers and be internalised.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Therefore, heterozygous mutations result in a 75% reduction in active CSF1/CSF1R dimers that can signal normally.</p>
      <p>Appropriate CSF1R signalling may be essential not only for CNS development, but also for the health of the fully developed brain. Recently it was shown that microglia in the adult brain are actively dependent on CSF1R signalling. Inhibition of signalling through CSF1R was found to lead to the rapid depletion of almost all brain microglia via apoptosis, with repopulation occurring when inhibition was withdrawn.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
      <p>The importance of microglia in maintaining a healthy CNS is increasingly recognised. Interestingly, homozygous mutations in <italic>TREM2</italic>, another microglial cell surface receptor, cause an early onset dementia, Nasu-Hakola disease.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Heterozygous variants in <italic>TREM2</italic> are also a significant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD),<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and genome-wide association studies have linked variants in the microglial receptors CD33 and IRF8 with AD and multiple sclerosis, respectively.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> These findings clearly point to the importance of microglia in the health of the CNS and the need to further study how microglial dysfunction leads to neuronal death.</p>
      <p>In this study, we found that <italic>CSF1R</italic> mutations account for approximately 10% of adult onset leukodystrophies in a mixed cohort from the UK, Greece and Ireland. We identified a range of phenotypes, with case 1 presenting with features suggesting a CNS vasculitis; cases 2, 4 and 5 had early and late parkinsonian features; and case 3 had a more classical cognitive phenotype.</p>
      <p>There are at least 30 different leukodystrophies that can present in adulthood, many of which have similar or even indistinguishable presentations making accurate diagnosis challenging.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Presence of axonal spheroids, pigmented cells and white matter degeneration in diagnostic brain biopsies is highly variable, subject to variable regional predilection for pathology, sampling bias and disease stage. Diagnostic brain biopsies should ideally include full thickness of the cortex and underlying white matter to reduce the sampling bias. In many cases, extensive and expensive testing is required to make a diagnosis. Our study confirms previous findings that <italic>CSF1R</italic> mutations are a relatively common cause of adult onset leukodystrophy and that <italic>CSF1R</italic> mutations can lead to diverse phenotypes and can mimic many other neurological diseases, including CNS vasculitis.</p>
      <p>As the phenotype of <italic>CSF1R</italic> mutations continues to be refined, we recommend that patients who present with a possible CNS vasculitis or undiagnosed adult onset leukodystrophy be screened early for mutations in <italic>CSF1R</italic>, and this should not be limited to patients with typical neuropsychiatric or parkinsonian presentations. The early detection of a known pathogenic <italic>CSF1R</italic> mutation may negate the need for a brain biopsy and its associated risks. Early genetic diagnosis in affected individuals will help guide clinician discussions around prognostication, genetic risk in other family members and reproductive counselling in families.</p>
      <p>In addition, where a brain biopsy has been performed for a suspected CNS vasculitis and a diagnosis not achieved, the biopsy sample should be carefully examined for the presence of axonal spheroids or pigmented glia and consideration given to <italic>CSF1R</italic> gene sequencing.</p>
