      <abstract>
        <p>The transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) plays a key role in immunity against mycobacterial and viral infections. Here, we characterize three human <italic>STAT1</italic> germline alleles from otherwise healthy patients with mycobacterial disease. The previously reported L706S, like the novel Q463H and E320Q alleles, are intrinsically deleterious for both interferon gamma (IFNG)&#x2013;induced gamma-activating factor&#x2013;mediated immunity and interferon alpha (IFNA)&#x2013;induced interferon-stimulated genes factor 3&#x2013;mediated immunity, as shown in STAT1-deficient cells transfected with the corresponding alleles. Their phenotypic effects are however mediated by different molecular mechanisms, L706S affecting STAT1 phosphorylation and Q463H and E320Q affecting STAT1 DNA-binding activity. Heterozygous patients display specifically impaired IFNG-induced gamma-activating factor&#x2013;mediated immunity, resulting in susceptibility to mycobacteria. Indeed, IFNA-induced interferon-stimulated genes factor 3&#x2013;mediated immunity is not affected, and these patients are not particularly susceptible to viral disease, unlike patients homozygous for other, equally deleterious <italic>STAT1</italic> mutations recessive for both phenotypes. The three <italic>STAT1</italic> alleles are therefore dominant for IFNG-mediated antimycobacterial immunity but recessive for IFNA-mediated antiviral immunity at the cellular and clinical levels. These <italic>STAT1</italic> alleles define two forms of dominant STAT1 deficiency, depending on whether the mutations impair STAT1 phosphorylation or DNA binding.</p>

        <title>Synopsis</title>
        <p>Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease is a rare syndrome. It is defined by the occurrence of severe disease caused by low virulence mycobacteria in otherwise healthy individuals, in whom antiviral immune response is not affected. Eleven known genetic defects, affecting five genes, have been involved in this type of deficient response to infection, involving immune-mediator molecules IL12 and interferon gamma: <italic>IL12B, IL12RB1, IFNGR1, IFNGR2,</italic> and <italic>STAT1.</italic> The signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) amino acid change L706S was previously shown to cause disease by impairing STAT1 phosphorylation. Here, we report two new <italic>STAT1</italic> mutations that impair STAT1 DNA-binding activity. We show, by functional analysis of the three <italic>STAT1</italic> mutant alleles, that they are intrinsically deleterious for both interferon gamma&#x2013;induced antimycobacterial immunity, which is mediated through gamma-activated factor and for interferon alpha&#x2013;induced antiviral immunity, which is mediated through interferon-stimulated genes factor 3. Interestingly, the three alleles are dominant for interferon gamma&#x2013;induced gamma-activated factor&#x2013;mediated antimycobacterial immunity, but recessive for interferon alpha&#x2013;induced interferon-stimulated genes factor 3&#x2013;mediated antiviral immunity at the cellular and clinical levels. These two new <italic>STAT1</italic> alleles, which affect the binding of STAT1 to DNA, define distinct novel genetic causes of Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease and provide further insight into the molecular mechanism of disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD) is characterized by the occurrence of clinical disease caused by weakly virulent mycobacteria in otherwise healthy individuals (reviewed in [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). This syndrome covers a broad range of clinical phenotypes, reflecting the diversity of environmental and host factors involved, notably the underlying genetic lesions. The five genes known to cause this syndrome are involved in IL12/23-dependent interferon gamma (IFNG)&#x2013;mediated immunity. Two genes control the production of IFNG: <italic>IL12B,</italic> encoding the p40 subunit of IL12 and IL23, and <italic>IL12RB1,</italic> encoding the &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub> chain of the IL12 and IL23 receptors (IL12RB1). Three genes control the response to IFNG: <italic>IFNGR1</italic> and <italic>IFNGR2,</italic> encoding the IFNG receptor (IFNGR) chains, and <italic>STAT1,</italic> encoding the signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1). Allelic heterogeneity results in a total of 11 inherited disorders (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020131-t001">Table 1</xref>): recessive complete IL12p40 [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and IL12RB1 deficiency with [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] or without [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] surface-expressed receptors, recessive complete IFNGR1 deficiency with [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] or without [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] surface-expressed receptors, dominant [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or recessive [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] partial IFNGR1 deficiency, recessive complete IFNGR2 deficiency with [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or without [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] surface-expressed receptors, recessive partial IFNGR2 deficiency [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and dominant partial STAT1 deficiency [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Complete IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 deficiencies run a more severe clinical course than the other defects, which are associated with residual IFNG-mediated immunity [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>

      <p>The binding of homodimeric IFNG to its tetrameric receptor leads to the activation of constitutively associated Janus kinases 1 and 2 (JAK1 and JAK2), which then phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the intracellular part of IFNGR1 (reviewed in [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

Upon IFNG stimulation, unphosphorylated STAT1 molecules are directly recruited to IFNGR1 docking sites (centered on phosphorylated Y440) [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. They are then phosphorylated at Y701 and released into the cytosol as phosphorylated STAT1 homodimers, forming gamma-activating factors (GAFs), which are translocated to the nucleus [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. GAF binds gamma-activating sequences (GASs) present in the promoters of target genes [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Following monomeric interferon alpha (IFNA) stimulation, STAT2 is recruited to the phosphorylated IFNAR1 chain of the heterodimeric IFNAR and is itself also phosphorylated by JAK1 and TYK2 (reviewed in [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This leads to the phosphorylated STAT2-mediated recruitment of STAT1, which is then phosphorylated at Tyr-701. Active phosphorylated STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers are released into the cytosol and translocated to the nucleus with ISGF3G, to form interferon-stimulated genes factor-3 (ISGF3) heterotrimers [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. ISGF3 binds IFNA sequence response elements (ISREs) in the promoters of target genes via the DNA-binding domains of STAT1 and ISGF3G [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>

It is associated with a specific syndrome, different from MSMD, of susceptibility to both mycobacteria (impaired IFNG-mediated immunity) and viruses (impaired IFNA-mediated immunity). The three known patients were unrelated and homozygous for specific loss-of-function and loss-of-expression <italic>STAT1</italic> mutations [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. No STAT1 proteins were detected in the patients' cells and, accordingly, no activation of GAF and ISGF3 was found in response to IFNG and IFNA, respectively. The heterozygous relatives of these patients were healthy. This contrasts with the heterozygous L706S <italic>STAT1</italic> mutation described in three patients from two kindreds with dominant partial STAT1 deficiency and MSMD [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The L706S allele is null (loss-of-function) for the activation of both GAF and ISGF3, despite normal levels of STAT1 production. Intriguingly, this allele was found to be dominant for GAF activation but recessive for ISGF3 activation. This accounted for the patient's clinical phenotype of mycobacterial but not viral disease, but raised the question as to whether this genetic curiosity was of general relevance. We report here two novel <italic>STAT1</italic> alleles associated with MSMD: E320Q and Q463H. Like L706S, but by completely different mechanisms, these alleles are dominant for IFNG-induced GAF-mediated but recessive for IFNA-induced ISGF3-mediated immunity.</p>

The coding regions of the five genes known to be associated with MSMD <italic>(IL12B, IL12RB1, IFNGR1, IFNGR2,</italic> and <italic>STAT1)</italic> were sequenced following amplification of the corresponding cDNAs from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)&#x2013;transformed B cells from the patients. Mutations were found in <italic>STAT1</italic> cDNAs, and were confirmed by sequencing products amplified from the corresponding <italic>STAT1</italic> genomic exons in EBV-transformed B cells and fresh blood cells. No mutations were found in the coding regions of the other four genes. A heterozygous nucleotide substitution at position 958 (G&#x2192;C) was found in <italic>STAT1</italic> exon 11 in P1, leading to a Glu&#x2192;Gln substitution at position 320 (E320Q). A heterozygous nucleotide substitution at position 1389 (G&#x2192;T) was found in exon 17 in P2, leading to a Gln&#x2192;His substitution at position 463 (Q463H). These mutations were not found in 75 unrelated European control individuals tested (150 chromosomes), suggesting they are not merely irrelevant polymorphisms. Moreover, P1&#x2032;s mother (A.III.2) had MSMD and was found to be heterozygous for the E320Q allele. Analysis of genomic DNA extracted from biopsy tissue taken from the deceased maternal grandfather of P1 (A.II.1), who had suffered from bona fide tuberculosis, showed that he too was heterozygous for the E320Q allele, providing further evidence for dominant cosegregation of the <italic>STAT1</italic> genotype and clinical phenotype. However, healthy relatives of P2 (B.II.3 and B.III.3) were found to be heterozygous for the Q463H mutation, suggesting that this allele (and possibly E320Q), like the previously reported L706S <italic>STAT1</italic> allele [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], is associated with a partial form of STAT1 deficiency, with low clinical penetrance.</p>

        <title>Molecular Representation of STAT1 Mutants</title>
        <p>According to the crystallographic structure of phosphorylated STAT1 dimers bound to DNA, the E320Q and Q463H mutations affect residues from the DNA-binding domain of STAT1 that are conserved in all known human STAT molecules [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We therefore attempted to predict the effect of these mutations on the binding of STAT1 homodimers to their GAS target region. The 3D models of the mutants shed light on the potential impact of these mutations on the binding of STAT1 homodimers to their GAS target DNA element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g003">3</xref>B, and unpublished data). The acidic E320 residue is located in a bulge at the very beginning of the eight-strand &#x3B2;-barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g003">Figure 3</xref>). It helps to stabilize the structure through the salt bridge it forms with K344 and R346 on the adjacent antiparallel strand, which contains residues in direct contact with DNA. Residue Q463 is directly involved in DNA binding, forming a hydrogen bond with thymidine, and coming into contact with the phosphate backbone of DNA. It also forms hydrogen bonds with residues S459 and N460, thereby stabilizing a loop that contacts DNA. These in silico studies suggest that the E320Q and Q463H mutations in <italic>STAT1</italic> are deleterious, as they are expected to affect the GAS DNA-binding activity of the corresponding mutant STAT1 proteins either directly or indirectly. They also suggest that the E320Q allele may be less severe than the Q463H allele. In contrast, residue L706 is located in the C-terminal tail segment (residues 701&#x2013;708), which is involved in STAT1 activation by phosphorylation of Y701 and STAT1 homodimerization. Residue L706 from one STAT1 molecule packs against a hydrophobic pocket formed by the side-chains of L706, I707, A641, and V642 from the other STAT1 molecule. The L706S mutation might therefore be expected to impair the Y701 phosphorylation and dimerization of STAT1.</p>

Cells from P1, P2, and P3 produced similar amounts of STAT1 protein to control cells (C), whereas STAT1 was absent in cells from P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020131-t002">Table 2</xref>).

In contrast, cells from P1 and P2 had normal levels of Y701-phosphorylated STAT1 following treatment with either type of IFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020131-t002">Table 2</xref>). We then investigated the nuclear translocation of STAT1 upon IFN stimulation in simian virus 40 (SV40)&#x2013;transformed fibroblasts from a healthy control (C), patients P1, P2, and P3, the STAT1-deficient fibrosarcoma cell line U3C, and its parental cell line 2C4 by immunofluorescence staining with a specific antibody. STAT1 nuclear accumulation in response to both IFNA and IFNG was normal in fibroblasts from P1 and P2, whereas it was, as expected, impaired in cells from P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020131-t002">Table 2</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. No staining was observed in U3C STAT1-deficient fibroblasts incubated with a STAT1-specific antibody, or in any other fibroblast line incubated with an isotypic control antibody (unpublished data). Staining with a STAT2-specific antibody indicated that the STAT1-containing complexes accumulating in the nucleus in response to IFNA consisted, at least partly, of ISGF3 ([<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and unpublished data).

Similar results were obtained upon IFNA stimulation, indicating the phenotype observed was strictly STAT1 dependent and independent of the amount of phosphorylated STAT1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020131-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020131-sg001">S1</xref>C). In addition, Q463H and L706S were found to be associated with a lack of ISRE-binding activity on stimulation with even high doses of IFNA (10<sup>5</sup> IU/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g006">Figure 6</xref>C and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020131-t002">Table 2</xref>), whereas the E320Q allele displayed only mildly impaired binding (90%, mean of three experiments, &#xB1; 17%) at the two highest concentrations of IFNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g006">Figure 6</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g006">6</xref>E, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020131-t002">Table 2</xref>). This reflects the known involvement of STAT1 with ISGF3G in ISGF3 binding to ISRE [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and indicates that Q463H and, to a lesser extent, E320Q, impair this process. The GAS- and ISRE-binding activities of WT and E320Q cells were shown to involve GAF and ISGF3, respectively, in competition experiments with unlabeled probe and supershift experiments (unpublished data). Thus, the L706S <italic>STAT1</italic> allele is therefore null for the DNA-binding activity of both GAF (to GAS elements) and ISGF3 (to ISRE elements), as previously shown in transient transfectants [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This defect is due to impaired Y701 phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation. The Q463H allele is also null for both cellular phenotypes, but the underlying mechanism is different, involving impaired DNA binding by nuclear STAT1-containing complexes. The E320Q allele acts by a similar mechanism, affecting DNA binding, but has a milder impact, being markedly hypomorphic for GAS-binding activity and barely hypomorphic for ISRE-binding activity. We cannot determine whether mutated proteins bind with less or no affinity or bind with a greater off rate.</p>

        <title>Mechanism of Dominance of the <italic>STAT1</italic> Alleles for GAS-Binding Activity</title>
        <p>We investigated the molecular mechanisms of dominance of E320Q, Q463H, and L706S <italic>STAT1</italic> alleles by studying EBV-transformed B cells from P4&#x2032;s father (+/&#x2212;) (heterozygous for the 1758_1759delAG <italic>STAT1</italic> allele encoding no detectable STAT1 [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]). These cells produced half the amount of STAT1 detected in six control cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g008">Figure 8</xref>A; unpublished data) but responded normally to IFNG in terms of GAS-binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). This clearly demonstrates that <italic>STAT1</italic> mutant alleles cannot be dominant due to haploinsufficiency, implying the involvement of a negative-dominance mechanism for the three mutant <italic>STAT1</italic> alleles studied here. We previously dissected the molecular mechanism involved in the loss-of-function and dominance associated with the L706S allele [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The docking site of unphosphorylated STAT1 on IFNGR1 has been shown to be created by the phosphorylation of Tyr 440 upon IFNG stimulation [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We further dissected this molecular mechanism underlying the negative dominance of the L706S allele, using biotinylated peptides corresponding to an intracellular segment of IFNGR1, unphosphorylated or phosphorylated at Tyr 440, or an irrelevant phosphorylated peptide. We incubated the peptides with whole-cell protein extracts from WT, L706S, and mock stable transfectant cell lines. Streptavidin immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with a STAT1-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g008">Figure 8</xref>C). We found that the phosphorylated IFNGR1 peptide, unlike the other two peptides, interacted strongly with WT and L706S STAT1 molecules, indicating that the L706S mutation does not impair the recruitment of STAT1 by phosphorylated IFNGR1 upon IFNG stimulation. The loss-of-phosphorylation associated with the L706S allele is therefore necessary and sufficient to account for the associated loss-of-function and the dominance of this allele. The loss-of-function Q463H allele, acting by a different mechanism, is also dominant for GAF activation in response to IFNG: only one in four combinations of STAT1-activated phosphodimers binds GAS correctly in the Q463H/WT cells from P2 (25% of normal levels). Interestingly, E320Q/WT cells from P1 had a higher level of IFNG-induced GAS-binding activity (33% of normal levels). The E320Q allele is dominant, for the same reasons as Q463H, but gives stronger responses to IFNG because it is hypomorphic (some E320Q-containing GAF molecules do bind GAS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g006">Figure 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g006">6</xref>B).</p>

        <title>Mechanism of Recessivity of <italic>STAT1</italic> Alleles for ISRE-Binding Activity</title>
        <p>We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the recessivity of the three deleterious mutations E320Q, Q463H, and L706S for ISGF3 binding to ISRE. We investigated P4&#x2032;s father, who produces half as much STAT1 protein as the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). His EBV-transformed B cells activated normal amounts of ISRE-binding ISGF3 proteins upon stimulation with IFNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g008">Figure 8</xref>D). Thus, deleterious <italic>STAT1</italic> alleles, whether affecting Y701 phosphorylation or DNA binding, cannot be haploinsufficient for ISGF3 binding to ISRE. Moreover, as ISGF3 complexes contain a single STAT1 molecule bound to STAT2 and ISGF3G (unlike GAF, which contains two STAT1 molecules), a mechanism involving the negative dominance of mutant <italic>STAT1</italic> alleles would require mutant STAT1 proteins to bind preferentially to STAT2 and ISGF3G, increasing the proportion of inactive ISGF3 complexes. We thus investigated whether the E320Q, Q463H, and L706S STAT1 proteins could interact with nonphosphorylated STAT2 in unstimulated cells (preassociation [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]), and with tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT2 upon IFNA stimulation [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We subjected stably transfected fibroblast cell lines, left unstimulated or stimulated with IFNA, to immunoprecipitation with a STAT1-specific antibody, followed by Western blotting with specific antibodies directed against tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT2, STAT2, tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1, and STAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g008">Figure 8</xref>E). Similar levels of preassociation between nonphosphorylated WT, E320Q, Q463H, and L706S STAT1 molecules and nonphosphorylated STAT2 were observed in resting cells. Upon IFNA stimulation, phosphorylated WT, E320Q, and Q463H STAT1 molecules interacted equally strongly with phosphorylated STAT2, whereas L706S displayed no high-affinity interaction with phosphorylated STAT2. This may reflect the documented lack of L706S phosphorylation at Y701, or the predicted impairment of Stat phosphodimer formation due to replacement of the key residue L706 [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], or both. Thus, (1) nonphosphorylated L706S STAT1 molecules are not associated with phosphorylated STAT2 upon IFNA stimulation, revealing a second impact of L706S, in addition to the loss of Y701 phosphorylation, accounting in part for the recessive nature of this mutation for ISGF3 activation; and (2) the E320Q and Q463H STAT1 mutants are normally recruited by phosphorylated STAT2, with which they form phosphorylated heterodimers. All three alleles are therefore recessive because no more than half of the ISGF3 complexes (none in the case of L706S) contain a mutant STAT1 molecule in heterozygous cells, and there is no haploinsufficiency.</p>

Accordingly, the response to BCG plus IL12 was normal in terms of IFNG production.

IL12 production in response to LPS was studied as a control and was found to be normal in P1&#x2032;s mother and P3. These immunological results, obtained with fresh blood cells, correlate with biochemical assays performed on the patient's EBV-transformed B cells. This cellular phenotype accounts for the immunological phenotype of impairment of the IL12&#x2013;IFNG circuit upon stimulation of the blood cells with mycobacteria and IFNG ex vivo. This immunological phenotype is, in turn, correlated with the clinical phenotype of impaired antimycobacterial immunity in vivo.</p>

We subjected stably transfected fibroblast cell lines to the same assay, and in contrast, cell lines expressing only Q463H or L706S controlled the growth of neither HSV nor VSV in response to IFNA, consistent with these alleles being null for ISGF3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g009">Figure 9</xref>B). The E320Q cell line presented no detectable defect in the control of HSV, but control of the more virulent VSV was clearly impaired. Similar data were reproducibly obtained with several concentrations of IFNA (data not shown). The deleterious impact of the hypomorphic E320Q allele therefore impaired, but did not completely abolish the response to IFNA, even at high doses (10<sup>5</sup> IU/ml). These functional results are therefore correlated with the ISRE-binding and ISGF3 transcriptional phenotypes. Heterozygous cell lines displayed normal ISRE-binding activity of ISGF3 and the normal induction of target genes in response to IFNA. This biochemical phenotype accounts for the immunological phenotype of normal control of HSV and VSV growth in vitro. This immunological phenotype is correlated with a clinical phenotype of normal resistance to most viruses in vivo [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (case reports). Thus, the deleterious E320Q, Q463H, and L706S mutations are dominant for GAS-binding and GAF transcriptional activity and antimycobacterial immunity and recessive for ISRE-binding and ISGF3 transcriptional activity and antiviral immunity.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We describe here a novel form of partial STAT1 deficiency, the 12th genetic etiology of MSMD to be identified and the second form of STAT1 deficiency shown to be associated with this syndrome [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The previously described L706S <italic>STAT1</italic> mutation in two kindreds leads to a defect in STAT1 phosphorylation at Y701 [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The E320Q and Q463H alleles result in impaired GAS binding by normally phosphorylated nuclear STAT1 homodimers. This finding has important clinical implications, because the screening of patients with MSMD by the detection of phosphorylated STAT1 in IFNG-stimulated blood cells would not detect this new form of STAT1 deficiency [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Measuring the induction of IL12 in response to IFNG is more appropriate as a first diagnostic step [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The clinical phenotype of patients with partial STAT1 deficiency is mild and resembles that of patients with partial IFNGR1 [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and IFNGR2 [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] deficiencies. The penetrance of partial STAT1 deficiency is low, as only five of ten heterozygous patients from four kindreds [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] had case-definition infectious diseases caused by poorly virulent mycobacteria, reflecting the complex interplay between host and environmental factors in the course of infections [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Interestingly, one deceased patient (A.II.1) heterozygous for the E320Q allele suffered from bona fide tuberculosis. Two deceased relatives (A.I.1 and B.I.1) also had tuberculosis, possibly due to heterozygosity for the deleterious <italic>STAT1</italic> alleles. This finding is reminiscent of our observation of patients with IL12RB1 deficiency presenting with tuberculosis as their sole clinical phenotype [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p>
      <p>The three mutant alleles are intrinsically deleterious for both IFNG-induced GAF-mediated and IFNA-induced ISGF3-mediated cellular activations, as shown in STAT1-deficient cells transfected with the corresponding alleles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020131-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g001">Figure 1</xref>). There is no haploinsufficiency of <italic>STAT1</italic> for IFNG-induced GAF activation, and these three alleles are dominant for this pathway by negative interaction. L706S STAT1 is recruited to IFNGR1 but is not phosphorylated in response to IFNG. Consistent with the ordered, affinity-driven IFNG signaling process, only one (WT/WT) of the four possible STAT1 (WT/WT, WT/L706S, L706S/WT, L706S/L706S) combinations therefore forms phosphodimers in heterozygous cells. Whereas L706S exerts its negative effect in the cytosol, the other two mutations, E320Q and Q463H STAT1, exert their negative effects in the nucleus. Only one (WT/WT) of the four possible STAT1 combinations forms phosphodimers binding GAS elements with normal affinity. In contrast, all three alleles are recessive for the IFNA-induced ISGF3-mediated signaling pathway. There is neither haploinsufficiency nor negative interaction. The lack of negative dominance, in particular, is accounted for by the three STAT1 mutant proteins being no better recruited than WT STAT1 proteins to phospho-STAT2 and the IFNAR. Indeed, L706S STAT1 may not be recruited at all to IFNAR-bound phospho-STAT2. Altogether, the <italic>STAT1</italic> alleles studied here are dominant for IFNG-induced GAF-mediated signaling and recessive for IFNA-induced ISGF3-mediated signaling.</p>
      <p>The three <italic>STAT1</italic> mutations are deleterious via different mechanisms, and they affect both cellular and clinical phenotypes, with a well-defined causal relationship between cellular defects and clinical diseases. Impaired IFNG-mediated immunity is associated with mycobacterial diseases, whereas impaired IFNA-mediated immunity is associated with viral diseases. It is widely accepted that the definition of candidate genes should take into account the observation that mutations in genes involved in multiple pathways in vitro can have an impact on only a few biochemical pathways in vivo, reflecting variable redundancy of the gene product. For example, complete STAT1 deficiency principally affects IFNA and IFNG responses in mice [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and humans [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] in vivo, but STAT1 is involved, albeit in a redundant manner, in many other pathways studied in vitro. Our study shows that the definition of candidate genes, for both cellular and clinical phenotypes, should also take into account the possibility that the impact of the gene may depend on whether the organism studied is heterozygous or homozygous for the mutation. As a proof of principle, the three <italic>STAT1</italic> alleles profoundly affect IFNG-mediated immune responses to mycobacteria, but not IFNA-mediated immune responses to viruses, in heterozygous cells and patients, whereas they would affect both responses in homozygous cells and patients [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>

        <p>P1 was born in Germany to unrelated German parents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020131-g002">Figure 2</xref>). He was vaccinated with BCG at birth. During the first year of his life, he developed disseminated BCG disease (BCG-osis) with fever, tuberculoid granulomatous inflammation, several small spots of osteolysis in his shoulder blade (close to the point at which the vaccine was administered), and a slightly enlarged spleen and enlarged lymph nodes in the lower abdomen. All conventional immunological assays (B cells, T cells, phagocytic respiratory burst) were normal. The patient was treated with antibiotics (isoniazid and rifampicin) for 7 mo and recovered. He was healthy at the age of 8 y as of June 2005. His mother developed local BCG disease (BCG-itis) after BCG vaccination at 14 y of age. She was healthy at the age of 38 y as of June 2005. P1&#x2032;s maternal grandfather developed disseminated tuberculosis at the age of 16 y. At the age of 32 y, he developed a severe skin disease with deep lupus vulgaris-like ulcers that destroyed part of his nose. He died at the age of 49 y from liver cancer due to cirrhosis of unknown origin. P1&#x2032;s mother's paternal grandfather died at the age of 38 y from tuberculosis. P1 had high titers of serum antibodies against mumps virus, varicella zoster virus, EBV, measles virus, rubella virus, influenza A virus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. His mother had high titers of serum antibodies against hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, varicella zoster virus, EBV, mumps virus, parvovirus B19, paranfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and enterovirus. The medical history of P2, also born to unrelated German parents in Germany, has been described elsewhere [<xref rid="pgen-0020131-b048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Briefly, he developed pulmonary <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. avium</named-content> infection at the age of 2 y. He was 10 y old as of June 2005 and well. P2 had high titers of serum antibodies against EBV, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus (I and III), and influenza virus (A and B). His father was hospitalized at the age of 25 y for a fever of unknown origin. He recovered on antibiotic treatment and was 39 y old as of June 2005 and well. He had been vaccinated with BCG in infancy, with no adverse effect. P2&#x2032;s paternal grandfather developed tuberculosis at the age of 20 y and recovered only after 5 y of hospitalization and antibiotic treatment in the 1950s. He died at the age of 50 y in unknown circumstances. P2&#x2032;s half-brother has remained healthy and was 2.5 y old as of June 2005.
