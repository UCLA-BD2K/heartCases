        <p>The gain of function mutation <italic>JAK2-V617F</italic> is very frequently found in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and is strongly implicated in pathogenesis of these and other hematological malignancies. Here we report establishment of a new leukemia cell line, PVTL-1, homozygous for <italic>JAK2-V617F</italic> from a 73-year-old female patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformed from MPN. PVTL-1 is positive for CD7, CD13, CD33, CD34, CD117, HLA-DR, and MPO, and has complex karyotypic abnormalities, 44,XX,-5q,-7,-8,add(11)(p11.2),add(11)(q23),&#x2212;16,+21,&#x2212;22,+mar1. Sequence analysis of <italic>JAK2</italic> revealed only the mutated allele coding for Jak2-V617F. Proliferation of PVTL-1 was inhibited and apoptosis was induced by the pan-Jak inhibitor Jak inhibitor-1 (JakI-1) or dasatinib, which inhibits the Src family kinases as well as BCR/ABL. Consistently, the Src family kinase Lyn was constitutively activated with phosphorylation of Y396 in the activation loop, which was inhibited by dasatinib but not by JakI-1. Further analyses with JakI-1 and dasatinib indicated that Jak2-V617F phosphorylated STAT5 and SHP2 while Lyn phosphorylated SHP1, SHP2, Gab-2, c-Cbl, and CrkL to induce the SHP2/Gab2 and c-Cbl/CrkL complex formation. In addition, JakI-1 and dasatinib inactivated the mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP1 pathway and reduced the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3 in PVTL-1 cells, which correlated with their effects on proliferation and survival of these cells. Furthermore, inhibition of GSK3 by its inhibitor SB216763 mitigated apoptosis induced by dasatinib but not by JakI-1. Together, these data suggest that apoptosis may be suppressed in PVTL-1 cells through inactivation of GSK3 by Lyn as well as Jak2-V617F and additionally through activation of STAT5 by Jak2-V617F. It is also speculated that activation of the mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP1 pathway may mediate proliferation signaling from Jak2-V617F and Lyn. PVTL-1 cells may provide a valuable model system to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in evolution of Jak2-V617F-expressing MPN to AML and to develop novel therapies against this intractable condition.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Jak2 plays a crucial role in regulation of proliferation and apoptosis of hematopoietic cells by coupling with a variety of cytokine receptors, such as those for erythropoietin and IL-3, to activate various signaling pathways including the STAT5, Ras/Raf-1/MEK/Erk, and phosphatidylinositol 3&#x2032;-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Ihle1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Ihle2">[2]</xref>. A somatic mutation of <italic>JAK2</italic>, coding for constitutively activated Jak2-V617F, is frequently observed in <italic>BCR/ABL1</italic>-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs): 96% in polycythemia vera (PV), 55% in essential thrombocythemia (ET), and 65% in primary myelofibrosis (PMF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Tefferi1">[3]</xref>. The <italic>JAK2-V617F</italic> mutation is also found, though much less frequently, in various other hematological malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), underscoring the importance of Jak2 in regulation of hematopoiesis. Jak2-V617F is constitutively activated without cytokine stimulation and stimulates the various downstream signaling pathways that are normally activated by cytokine-stimulated Jak2, such as the STAT5, MEK/Erk and PI3K/Akt pathways, thus leading to cytokine-independent cell survival and proliferation when expressed in cytokine-dependent hematopoietic cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Ihle2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-LaFave1">[4]</xref>. Moreover, various murine models have demonstrated that Jak2-V617F causes a phenotype similar to PV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-QuintasCardama1">[5]</xref>. A number of Jak2 inhibitors have been developed and under clinical trials or approved for clinical use against MPNs with limited success, which is partly because of their inherent myelo-suppressive effects due to inhibition of normal Jak2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-LaFave1">[4]</xref>. Although some cases of PV, and less frequently those of ET, progress and transform into MDS or AML, the significance of Jak2-V617F in the evolution of diseases remains unknown, because the progression dose not correlate with the presence or allele burden of <italic>JAK2-V617F</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Tefferi1">[3]</xref>. Furthermore, <italic>JAK2-V617F</italic>-negative AML may arise from <italic>JAK2-V617F</italic>-positive PV or ET cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Theocharides1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The Src family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (SFKs), such as Lyn, Hck, and Fgr, also play important roles in regulation of survival and proliferation of normal or malignant hematopoietic cells downstream of the cytokine and growth factor receptors or aberrantly activated tyrosine kinase mutants, such as BCR/ABL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Ingley1">[7]</xref>. We previously reported that Lyn was activated downstream of Epo-stimulated Jak2 and involved in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 and the signal adaptor molecule CrkL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Chin1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Arai1">[9]</xref>. Moreover, activation of Lyn may play a role in acquisition of imatinib resistance of BCR/ABL-expressing leukemic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Wu1">[10]</xref>, in which Jak2 was implicated in upregulation of the Lyn kinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Samanta1">[11]</xref>. It was also reported that the Lyn kinase activity was elevated in most of the AML samples and was implicated in leukemic cell proliferation possibly by activating the mTOR signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-DosSantos1">[12]</xref>. The mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) plays critical roles in cell growth and proliferation by phosphorylating p70S6K and 4EBPs, including 4EBP1, to promote ribosome biogenesis and mRNA translation of proteins required for cell proliferation, such as c-Myc and Cyclin D1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Chapuis1">[13]</xref>. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying activation of various signaling pathways by Lyn to stimulate proliferation and sustain survival of leukemic cells remain poorly understood.</p>
      <p>Five AML cell lines with the Jak2-V617F mutation have previously been reported and utilized for various studies on Jak2-mediated signaling and leukemogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Levine1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Quentmeier1">[15]</xref>. In the present study, we establish and characterize a new leukemic cell line, PVTL-1, derived from a patient with AML evolving from PV. Intriguingly, proliferation and survival of PVTL-1 is dependent not only on Jak2-V617F but also on constitutively activated Lyn. We find that Jak2-V617 is mainly involved in activation of STAT5, while Lyn is responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of various signaling molecules, such as SHP2, Gab2, CrkL, c-Cbl, and Shc, which form various signaling complexes. Furthermore, Jak2-V617F as well as Lyn is involved in activation of the mTOR pathway and inactivation of GSK3, which may play critical roles in proliferation and survival of PVTL-1 cells. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which Jak2-V617F and Lyn protect PVTL-1 cells from apoptosis and stimulate proliferation may provide valuable information for pathogenesis of AML transformation from MPN and for development of novel therapeutic strategies against this intractable disease condition.</p>

        <title>Case Report</title>
        <p>A 58-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital because of increases in blood cell counts in July 1995. Her peripheral blood counts were as follows: red blood cells 8.29&#xD7;10<sup>12</sup>/L, hemoglobin 17.9 g/dL, platelets 1,680&#xD7;10<sup>9</sup>/L, and white blood cells 18.7&#xD7;10<sup>9</sup>/L. The bone marrow was hypercellular with a marked increase in megakaryocytes and normal myeloid and erythroid differentiation. The karyotype was 46,XX without the Philadelphia chromosome. These findings were compatible with the diagnosis of PV, and the patient was treated with busulfan followed by hydroxyurea for more than 10 years. The disease transformed to MDS in 2009, with the development of anemia, trilineage dysplasia in the bone marrow, and the complex karyotypic abnormalities in the bone marrow cells: 45,XX,der(5;17)(p10;q10) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Samanta1">[11]</xref>/45,XX,der(5;7)(p10;q10),add(11)(p11.2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-QuintasCardama1">[5]</xref>/46,XX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-LaFave1">[4]</xref>. In March 2010, at the age of 73, the disease further progressed to AML with the peripheral blood findings of hemoglobin 6.3 g/dL, platelets 79&#xD7;10<sup>9</sup>/L, and white blood cells 57.8&#xD7;10<sup>9</sup>/l with 40% myeloblasts.

To explore the significance of Jak2-V617F in PVTL-1 cells, we examined the effect of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the Jak family kinases, JakI-1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g002">Fig. 2A&#x2013;D</xref>, JakI-1 significantly inhibited proliferation of PVTL-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner and reduced its viability. As expected, imatinib, a first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor used clinically to inhibit BCR/ABL, did not show any significant effect on proliferation and viability of PVTL-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g002">Fig. 2A, B</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g002">Fig. 2C and D</xref>, dasatinib up to 20 nM did not show any significant effect on proliferation of HEL cells, which was dose-dependently inhibited by JakI-1, in accordance with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Levine1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Quentmeier1">[15]</xref>.

        <p>Because the most prominently tyrosine-phosphorylated protein corresponded in size with Lyn and was dephosphorylated by dasatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), we next immunoprecipitated Lyn and examined its activation-specific phosphorylation on Y396 in the activation loop. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, the activation-specific phosphorylation of Lyn was constitutively observed and was abrogated by dasatinib. We also examined Jak2-V617F and found that it is also constitutively phosphorylated on Y1007/Y1008 in the activation loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). JakI-1 augmented tyrosine phosphorylation of Y1007/Y1008, as expected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-LaFave1">[4]</xref>. Unexpectedly, dasatinib inhibited phosphorylation of Jak2-V617 on tyrosines but not that on Y1007/Y1008 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>
        <p>We next immunoprecipitated various intracellular signaling molecules and examined their tyrosine phosphorylation in PVTL-1 cells. First, CrkL was confirmed to be constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and was found to bind c-Cbl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Dasatinib abrogated both its phosphorylation and binding with c-Cbl. The tyrosine phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2 were also constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine, which was abrogated by dasatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). JakI-1 partly inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2 but not SHP1. The adaptor protein Gab2 was also constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine and physically associated with SHP2, which was strongly inhibited by dasatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>). JakI-1 did not show any significant effect on phosphorylation of Gab2 but partly inhibited its binding with SHP2. These data suggest that Lyn is constitutively activated in PVTL-1 cells and activates signaling pathways involving the SHP2/Gab2 and CrkL/c-Cbl complexes as well as SHP1 among others, while Jak2-V617F uniquely activates STAT5 and is partly involved in phosphorylation of SHP2.</p>

Activation-specific phosphorylation of STAT5A on Y694, one of the major substrates of Jak2, was also observed at a much lower level in PVTL-1 cells than in HEL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). On the other hand, Lyn was expressed at a significantly higher level in PVTL-1 cells as compared with HEL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Importantly, activation-specific phosphorylation of Lyn on Y397 was observed conspicuously in PVTL-1 cells, but not in HEL cells, and was downregulated by dasatinib. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084746.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>, Jak2-V617 also failed to induce activation of Lyn in murine hematopoietic BaF3 cells expressing the Epo receptor, while BCR/ABL activated Lyn in BaF3 cells, in accordance with our previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Wu2">[25]</xref>. It was also confirmed that Lyn was expressed at a much higher level in PVTL-1 cells as compared in BaF3 cells. These observations raise a possibility that overexpression of Lyn in PVTL-1 cells may be responsible for its constitutive activation and may compensate for the relatively weak activation of the Jak2/STAT5 pathway.</p>

        <p>Then we examined activation of various signaling events possibly downstream of Jak2-V617F and Lyn in PVTL-1 and HEL cells in comparable manners. We could detect the activated form of Erk, which was inhibited by JakI-1, in HEL cells but not in PVTL-1 cells, although the expression level of Erk in PVTL-1 cells was higher than that in HEL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). Whereas Akt was expressed at comparable levels in PVTL-1 and HEL cells, we could not detect the activation-specific Akt phosphorylated on T308 or S473 using specific antibodies in Western blot analyses (negative data not shown). Intriguingly, however, Western blot analyses revealed that the mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP-1 pathway, known to be activated downstream of the PI3K/Akt and MEK/Erk pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Chapuis1">[13]</xref>, was constitutively activated in PVTL-1 and HEL cells, because mTOR and its downstream effector kinase p70S6K were phosphorylated on activation-specific sites and their substrates, 4EBP-1, S6RP, and eIF4B, were constitutively phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g005">Fig. 5C and E</xref>). Moreover, activation of the mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP-1 pathway was significantly inhibited by JakI-1 as well as dasatinib in PVTL-1 cells and selectively by JakI-1 in HEL cells. Similarly, the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3&#x3B1;/&#xDF; on S21/9, known to be mediated mainly by Akt, was observed in these cell lines and was significantly inhibited by JakI-1 as well as dasatinib in PVTL-1 cells and selectively by JakI-1 in HEL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>). Thus, both Jak2-V617F and Lyn may be required for activation of the mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP-1 pathway as well as inhibition of GSK3&#x3B1;/&#xDF; in PVTL-1 cells, while Jak2-V617F alone may be involved in these signaling events in HEL cells. It is also important to note that inhibition of the mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP-1 pathway and activation of GSK3&#x3B1;/&#xDF; correlated with downregulation of proliferation and survival in these cells.</p>
        <p>Although we could not detect activation-specific phosphorylation of Akt in PVTL-1 cells, we still examined the possibility that PI3K and Akt may be involved in the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3&#x3B1;/&#xDF; in PVTL-1 cells by using their specific inhibitors GDC-0941 and MK-2206, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084746.s001">Fig. S1C</xref>, GDC-0941 inhibited the phosphorylation of GSK3&#x3B1;/&#xDF; in PVTL-1 cells, while MK-2206 failed to show any significant inhibitory effect. Thus, the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3&#x3B1;/&#xDF; may be regulated by PI3K in mostly Akt-independent manners in these cells. It was also confirmed that, like in PVTL-1 and HEL cells, Jak2-V617F induced the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3&#xDF; in BaF3 cells expressing the Epo receptor in a manner dependent on its kinase activity similarly with BCR/ABL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084746.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>). Because GSK3 has been strongly implicated in regulation of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Chiara1">[26]</xref>, we examined the possible involvement of GSK3 in induction of apoptosis by JakI-1 or dasatinib in PVTL-1 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>, inhibition of GSK3 by its specific inhibitor SB216763 unambiguously mitigated apoptosis induced by dasatinib but not JakI-1. In accordance with this, SB216763 remarkably inhibited the cleavage of caspase-3 in PVTL-1 cells treated with dasatinib without showing any significant inhibitory effect on that in cells treated with JakI-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g005">Fig. 5G</xref>). These results suggest that mechanisms underlying induction of apoptosis by dasatinib may mainly involve GSK3 activation, while JakI-1 may induce apoptosis also by specifically affecting other signaling pathways, such as the STAT5 pathway.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study, we have newly established a leukemic cell line, PVTL-1, homozygous for the <italic>JAK2-V617F</italic> mutation from a patient with AML transformed from PV. Previously, 5 AML cell lines carrying the <italic>JAK2-V617F</italic> mutation have been reported: HEL, MB-02, MUTZ-8, SET-2, and UKE-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Levine1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Quentmeier1">[15]</xref>. Three of them were derived from AML transformed from <italic>BCR/ABL1</italic>-negative MPNs: SET-2 and UKE-1 from ET and MB-02 from PMF. Except for SET-2 cells, all of these cell lines are homozygous for the Jak2-V617F mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Quentmeier1">[15]</xref>. The homozygosity is also frequently observed in patients with PV most likely due to mitotic recombination causing loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 9p affecting <italic>JAK2</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Levine1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Kralovics1">[18]</xref>. HEL and SET-2 additionally show amplification of the <italic>JAK2</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Quentmeier1">[15]</xref>. Intriguingly, all these cell lines exhibited losses of long-arm material from both chromosomes 5 and 7, except for UKE-1 showing monosomy 7 alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Quentmeier1">[15]</xref>. In accordance with this, PVTL-1 also showed 5q- and -7. Thus, losses of 5q and 7q may cooperate with Jak2-V617F for transformation into AML or for establishment as cell line, which needs to be explored in future studies. Also in accordance with the cell lines previously reported, PVTL-1 cells were highly sensitive to JakI-1, which reduced proliferation of PVTL-1 cells and induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g002">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g003">3</xref>). Therefore, PVTL-1 cells are dependent on Jak2-V617F and should provide a model system suitable for studies aiming to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying progression and transformation of MPNs to AML/MDS involving Jak2-V617F.</p>
      <p>The present study has shown that PVTL-1 cells are also dependent on or addicted to the constitutively activated Lyn kinase activity. First, dasatinib inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of PVTL-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas imatinib at 5 &#xB5;M did not show any significant effect on these cells. Although dasatinib also inhibits c-Kit (CD117), which is expressed on PVTL-1 cells, and the PDGF receptor &#xDF;, these kinases should be also inhibited by imatinib at 5 &#xB5;M <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Shami1">[24]</xref>. These results indicate that the SFKs should play a critical role in proliferation and survival of PVTL-1 cells. Second, Lyn was constitutively phosphorylated on the activation-specific Y396 in the activation loop and comigrated with the major phosphotyrosyl protein in PVTL-1 cells, which was dephosphorylated by dasatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g004">Fig. 4A, B</xref>). Although the possible involvement of other members of SFKs could not be ruled out, these results indicate that the Lyn activity should be largely responsible for proliferation and survival of PVTL-1 cells. A previous study implicated Jak2 activation by BCR/ABL in activation of Lyn in imatinib-resistant CML cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Samanta1">[11]</xref>. However, inhibition of Jak2-V617F by JakI-1 did not show any effect on activation-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn in PVTL-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g005">5C</xref>). Moreover, Jak2-V617F did not activate Lyn in HEL cells or in the BaF3 cells engineered to express Jak2-V617F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g005">Fig. 5C and S</xref>1B), which indicates that Jak2-V617F <italic>per se</italic> should not cause activation of Lyn in these cells. On the other hand, because the expression level of Lyn was much higher than that in HEL or BaF3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084746.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>), its overexpression should be, at least partly, responsible for the increased activity. Intriguingly, the Lyn overexpression has also been reported in primary CML cells with imatinib resistance and in primary CLL cells and implicated in proliferation and survival of these cells through the increased kinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Wu1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Contri1">[27]</xref>. Cytogenetically, PVTL-1 cells do not show any structural abnormality of chromosome 8, which harbors the <italic>LYN</italic> locus at 8q12.1, but rather show monosomy 8. Nevertheless, future studies are needed to examine the possible amplification of this locus as well as the aberrant transcriptional activation of <italic>LYN</italic> through various mechanisms, including mutations in the regulatory region and epigenetic deregulation. It is tempting to speculate that the overexpression and activation of Lyn might have played a role in transformation of PV into AML in the present case. It should be also noted that dasatinib alone or in combination with clinically relevant Jak2 inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, may provide an effective therapeutic strategy to treat similar cases, because dasatinib showed a more remarkable inhibitory effect on proliferation of PVTL-1 cells than JakI-1 and acted synergistically with JakI-1.</p>
      <p>Studies using JakI-1 or dasatinib indicated that Jak2-V617F was involved uniquely in induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5, STAT3, and, at least partly, SHP2, while Lyn was involved in that of various signaling molecules, including SHP1, SHP2, CrkL, c-Cbl, and Gab2 as well as in induction of complex formation of Gab2 with SHP2 and c-Cbl with CrkL in PVTL-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). We previously showed that Lyn was involved in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 as well as CrkL in signaling from the Epo receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Chin1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Arai1">[9]</xref>. Other studies have also implicated Lyn in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in several signaling pathways, including those involved in pathogenesis of AML and MPNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Okamoto1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Takeda1">[29]</xref>. In contrast to these observations, Jak2-V617F alone is responsible for the activation-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in PVTL-1 cells, while Lyn is responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of various signaling molecules known to be involved in activation of the PI3K/Akt and MEK/Erk signaling pathways. Intriguingly, dasatinib reduced phosphorylation of Jak2-V617F on tyrosines other than Y1007/Y1008 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). It has been reported that Jak2 is phosphorylated on several tyrosine residues, which regulates the kinase activity of Jak2 in either positive or negative ways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-LaFave1">[4]</xref>. Thus, although dasatinib failed to affect activation-specific phosphorylation of STAT5, a well established substrate of Jak2, it is possible that Lyn may modulate the activity of Jak2-V617F in PVTL-1 cells, which needs to be addressed in future studies.</p>
      <p>The mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP-1 pathway, known to be activated downstream of the PI3K/Akt and MEK/Erk pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Chapuis1">[13]</xref>, was constitutively activated in PVTL-1 as well as in HEL cells, although we failed to detect activation of Akt or Erk using activation-specific antibodies in immunoblot analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g005">Fig. 5D</xref> and data not shown). Activation of this pathway was inhibited by JakI-1 as well as dasatinib in PVTL-1 cells and selectively by JakI-1 in HEL cells, thus showing correlation with proliferation and survival of these cells. Intriguingly, previous reports showed that mTOR was activated more frequently than Akt in primary AML cells most likely in a PI3K-independent manner and possibly through Lyn activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-DosSantos1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Chapuis1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Tamburini1">[30]</xref>. Furthermore, mTOR is also activated in Jak2-V617F-expressing cells, including MPN cells, and its inhibition showed a cytostatic rather than an apoptotic effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Bogani1">[31]</xref>. Thus, it is possible that Jak2-V617F and Lyn may stimulate proliferation of PVTL-1 cells through activation of mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP-1 pathway.</p>
      <p>It is also important to note that JakI-1 and dasatinib reduced the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3&#x3B1;/&#xDF; on S21/9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>), which should increase the kinase activity of GSK3 playing important roles in regulation of a variety of cellular processes, including apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Chiara1">[26]</xref>. In this regard, we previously found that inhibition of Jak2-V617F activates GSK3 to induce degradation of Jak2-V617F and apoptosis synergistically with DNA damage-inducing chemotherapeutics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0084746-Nagao1">[19]</xref>. Furthermore, inhibition of GSK3 activation by SB216763 very efficiently reduced apoptosis of PVTL-1 cells treated with dasatinib but not with JakI-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g005">Fig. 5F, G</xref>). This difference may be explained by the fact that JakI-1 but not dasatinib additionally inhibits STAT5 activation in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Based on these data, we put forward a hypothetic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0084746-g006">Fig. 6</xref>), in which both Jak2-V617F and Lyn inactivate GSK3 to prevent apoptosis and activate the mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP-1 pathway to promote proliferation of PVTL-1 cells, while Jak2-V617F additionally activates STAT5 to prevent apoptosis. Further studies are in progress to elucidate the mechanisms involved in regulation of GSK3 and the mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP-1 pathway by Jak2-V617F and Lyn as well as the mechanisms involved in regulation of apoptosis and proliferation downstream of these events and STAT5 activation in PVTL-1 cells. Preliminary studies using specific inhibitors suggested that the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3&#x3B1;/&#xDF; may be regulated by PI3K in mostly Akt-independent manners in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084746.s001">Fig. S1C</xref>). Elucidation of these mechanisms would shed more light on pathogenesis of MPNs and its progression and may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategy against these intractable diseases.</p>
