<bold>Clinical data:</bold> Fatigue on mild exertion and accentuated cyanosis have been
noted two years ago. He was operated at 17 days and at nine months for right and left
Blalock Taussig, respectively. The saturation remained above 85%, but Hct = 65% and Hb = 19
g/dl guided the performance of bidirectional Glenn at 19 years old. Cardiac catheterization
at 20 years revealed average pulmonary pressure of 22 mmHg, which postponed the operative
indication to complete the Fontan principle. He remained using aspirin, with oxygen
saturation above 80%, Hct = 63%, and Hg = 20 g/dl.</p>
    <p>
<bold>Physical examination:</bold> Eupneic, cyanotic +, normal pulses, no jugular venous
distension. Weight 58 kg, height 163 cm, BP: 90/60 mmHg, HR: 78 bpm, oxygen saturation =
83%. Palpable aorta ++ at supra sternal notch.</p>
    <p>In precordium, ictus cordis at the 4th and 5th LICS and discrete systolic impulses in LSB.
Hyperphonetic heart sounds, systolic murmur, + +, rough, LSB, and tip; discrete continuous
murmur at supra sternal notch. The liver was not palpable.</p>

      <p><bold>Electrocardiogram</bold> showed sinus rhythm and signs of biatrial and left
ventricle overloads. P wave was peaked in I, V2-5, and extended in II, F, V5-6, with
negative deflection in V1 and V2. The QRS complex was of RS morphology in V1 and Rs in
V6. AQRS: +120&#xBA;, AT: -60&#xBA;, AP: +40&#xBA;.</p>
      <p><bold>Chest radiography</bold> showed an enlarged heart of mild degree (cardiothoracic
ratio: 0.54) with left long ventricular arch and also a long left medium arch. The
pulmonary vascular bed was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure
1</xref>).</p>

          <p>The chest X-ray shows an enlarged heart, long ventricular and long middle left
arch, and increased pulmonary vascular bed. The middle arch suggests the aorta
emerging from the right ventricle to the left. Four-chamber apical
echocardiography highlights in A the double inlet tract of single left ventricle
with two atrioventricular valves, and in B, in the same projection, moderate
insufficiency of the right atrioventricular valve (mosaic of regurgitation).</p>

      <p><bold>Echocardiogram</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>) showed
double inlet tract of single left ventricle with ventriculoarterial discordance, aorta
emerging from the right rudimentary ventricle to the left and pulmonary valve atresia.
The main ventricle had a diameter of 80mm and there was moderate atrioventricular valve
insufficiency to the right and mild to the left. Ventricular function was 58% by the
Sympson method. The anastomosis of Blalock-Taussig type was patent on both sides and
Glenn functioning. The pulmonary arteries were of appropriate size, with mild stenosis
to the left.</p>
      <p><bold>Catheterization and cardiac tomography </bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>) revealed a venous vessel diverting the flow of the right superior
vena cava by the innominate vein to the coronary sinus. The pulmonary artery mean
pressure was 17 mmHg, and after the momentary closure of the innominate vein by balloon
catheter, it increased to 19 mmHg. Pulmonary vascular resistance was 1.6 UW.</p>

          <p>Heart angiocardiography highlights the right superior vena cava in connection with
the right pulmonary artery of good diameter, and the beginning of the venovenous
vessel in A, which continues bordering the heart, B, and goes into the right
atrium, in C. The left pulmonary artery is of good caliber and with discrete
pre-hilar narrowing in D.</p>

      <p><bold>Clinical diagnosis:</bold> Double inlet tract of the single left ventricle,
ventriculoarterial discordance with aorta to the left, pulmonary atresia, bilateral
Blalock-Taussig, bidirectional Glenn, pulmonary artery stenosis to the left,
atrioventricular valve insufficiency, and venovenous insufficiency to the coronary
sinus, in chronic hypoxia.</p>
      <p><bold>Clinical reasoning:</bold> The clinical elements of cyanotic heart disease with
decreased pulmonary blood flow and long term hypoxemia manifest themselves as fatigue
and increased hematocrit. The hyperphonetic heart sounds guide to the arterial
malposition with obstruction to pulmonary blood flow, compensated by systemic pulmonary
anastomoses, these externalized by continuous murmur. Left ventricular overload on ECG
directs to diagnosis of single left ventricle, and the emergence of atrioventricular
valve insufficiency results from volume overload over time. Chest radiography suggests
the aorta to the left (long middle arch).</p>
      <p><bold>Differential Diagnosis:</bold> Heart diseases with rudimentary right ventricle of
tricuspid atresia type are accompanied by left hemiblock. The most difficult
differential diagnosis occurs in the presence of other abnormalities that are
accompanied by hypoplastic right ventricle.</p>
      <p><bold>Conduct:</bold> Given the impact of long-term hypoxemia with unfavorable clinical
manifestation, cavopulmonary operation was indicated, in addition to correction of
atrioventricular valve insufficiency, ligature of systemic pulmonary anastomoses and
venovenous vessel, and stenosis of the left pulmonary artery. The surgical risk was
estimated by the marked increase in pulmonary pressure, the left ventricular
dysfunction, despite of being discrete, and the other factors mentioned, in addition to
the adult age. The low pulmonary resistance with high oxygen saturation constituted a
mitigating factor. The surgical planning was completed with the steps previously
outlined. Proceeded to the right AV valve closure, which was malformed and difficult to
repair. Outer tube 20 was inserted between the inferior vena cava and right pulmonary
artery, with 4-mm fenestration between the tube and the atrial cavity. The immediate
evolution was favorable, with endotracheal extubation in the early hours, central venous
pressure lower than 14 mmHg, and oxygen saturation above 90%.</p>
      <p><bold>Comments:</bold> Although palliative, the Fontan operation, with evolution
complicating factors, continues to offer good prospects provided the indication criteria
are strictly observed. In the adult, given the obligatory acquired factors in heart
diseases with long-lasting overloads, the surgical risk becomes higher (10%). In this
circumstance, the difficulty of the surgical indication lies on acquired aspects, such
as ventricular dysfunction, anatomical lesions of the valves, in addition to high
pressure in the pulmonary artery, among others. These elements are to be counteracted
with unfavorable clinical evolution resulting from representative elements of chronic
hypoxia. The post-operative benefits can supersede them; therefore, clinical reasoning
should prioritize elements considered reversible.</p>
