        <p>Paralabral cyst of the shoulder joint can be observed in 2% to 4% of the general population, particularly in men during the third and fourth decade. On average, these cysts measure 10 mm to 20 mm in diameter and are located preferentially on the postero-superior aspect of the glenoid. The MRI has increased the frequency of the diagnosis of paralabral cysts of the shoulder joint. Paralabral cysts of the shoulder joint usually develop in the proximity of the labrum. The relationship between shoulder instability and labral tears is well known, however, the association of shoulder instability with a paralabral cyst is rare. Shoulder instability may cause labral injury or labral injury may cause shoulder instability, and then injured tear develops paralabral cyst.

  <body>
    <p>The widespread use of MRI has increased the frequency of diagnosing paralabral cysts of the shoulder joint. Paralabral cysts of the shoulder joint usually develop in the proximity of the labrum. The underlying cause of paralabral cysts has not yet been identified. We treated a case with a paralabral cyst of the shoulder, and this lesion was associated with an inferior labral tear and multidirectional instability.</p>
    <sec sec-type="cases">
      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 20-year-old man had a history of multiple subluxation/dislocation episodes of the shoulder joint for several years and he could voluntarily dislocate his shoulder. Six months ago, his shoulder pain increased after strenuous exercise. He had full range of motion of the shoulder joint. The physical examination showed the sulcus sign (grade 2), a positive anterior drawer test (grade 2) and a positive posterior drawer test (grade 2). The anterior and posterior apprehension test was also positive.</p>
      <p>Preoperatively, the Rowe score was 35 and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES)/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) score was 80 and 25 respectively. The simple radiologic findings showed no bony abnormalities. MRI of the left shoulder demonstrated a multiseptated cyst in the inferior aspect of the glenoid neck and a suspected labral tear (arrows) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The electromyogram findings showed non-specific findings. We initially recommend physical therapy such as stretching and strengthening exercise. However, his symptoms were not improved after 6 months of rehabilitation.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>Arthroscopic Findings</title>
        <p>The patient was placed in the lateral decubitus position with longitudinal traction of the affected upper limb and he was given general anesthesia. An arthroscope was inserted through a posterior portal, and the intra-articular lesions were examined. The drive-through sign was seen in the glenohumeral joint. The biceps tendon and rotator cuff tendon were intact. The arthroscopic findings showed a 2 &#xD7; 1 cm sized multilobulated cyst on the inferior labrum from 6 o'clock to 7 o'clock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). A whitish colored cystic sac was found and then mucinous fluid was noted after piercing the sac with a spinal needle. The remnant of the synovial sac was decompressed and debrided with an arthroscopic shaver. A punch biopsy of the synovial sac was performed. The arthroscopic findings showed a 2 &#xD7; 1 cm multilobulated cyst at the antero-inferior labrum from 4 o'clock to 6 o'clock, and the cyst was filled with mucinous fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Seemingly, incomplete detachment of the inferior labrum and a marginal crack could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), but complete detachment of the postero-inferior labrum was confirmed with a probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>
        <p>We debrided and detached the labral tear site completely and then arthroscopic anterior and posterior labroplasty was done with suture anchors (Smith &amp; Nephew, Andover, MA, USA). Three anchors were initially used and these were inserted into the postero-inferior glenoid and then the posterior labral repair was done (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>) Two more anchors were inserted into the antero-inferior glenoid and then labroplasty was done (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Also, the capsular defect produced by the excisional procedure was repaired with #2 ethibond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Finally, inferior capsular plication and rotator interval closure were done with #2.0 polydioxane sutures to augment the capsular redundancy. The drive-through sign disappeared after the operation. Pendulum exercise was started on postoperative one day. During the following six weeks, passive range of motion was continued and we kept the abduction brace on his shoulder. After six weeks, we started strengthening exercise for the rotator cuff muscles and the scapular stabilizing muscles. At postoperative 2 years, the patient has had pain-free shoulder motion and no further dislocation. Physical examination showed the sulcus sign (grade 1+), an anterior drawer test of grade 1+, a posterior drawer test of grade 1+ and a negative apprehension test. At the last follow-up, the Rowe score was 85 and the ASES/UCLA score was 98.5 and 33, respectively. The follow-up MRI showed complete resolution of the inferior paralabral cyst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Shoulder instability is divided voluntary and involuntary instability. For the case of involuntary instability, surgical treatment is necessary, but for the case of voluntary instability, the surgical indications should be strict because of secondary compensation such as military issues and the occupational worker's gain. If there is a pathologic condition such as labral tear, cyst and/or rotator cuff injury, then surgical treatment should be considered.</p>
      <p>A paralabral cyst of the shoulder joint can be observed in 2% to 4% of the general population, and particularly in men during the third and fourth decades. On average, these cysts measure 10 mm to 20 mm in diameter and they are preferentially located on the postero-superior aspect of the glenoid.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1)</xref></p>
      <p>The cysts may or not be observed to communicate with a labral tear. Westerheide et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2)</xref> and Westerheide and Karzel<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3)</xref> advocated that labral pathology was the main cause of periarticular cysts. On the contrary, Piatt et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4)</xref> reported that paralabral cysts spontaneously resolved in 2 patients, as assessed on MRI. Youm et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5)</xref> reported that repair of a labral tear, without cyst excision, resulted in successful outcomes for all 10 patients who had spinoglenoid cysts associated with superior labral tears. They advocated that the treatment given for intra-articular disease was the key component of the surgical management.</p>
      <p>The symptoms of a paralabral cyst may be the result of rotator cuff disease, labral disease, entrapment syndrome from compression of the suprascapular nerve, instability or a combination of these conditions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7)</xref> The most common complication is the suprascapular nerve entrapment syndrome, which leads to pain and supraspinatus and/or infraspinatus atrophy. In the shoulder, a labral tear can cause mechanical symptoms and instability symptoms. The English medical literature shows only 3 reports of the paralabral cyst of the shoulder associated with glenohumeral instability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10)</xref> Our current report is a rare case of inferior paralabral cyst combined with multidirectional instability. The previous reports only describe anterior, posterior and superior paralabral cyst with shoulder instability. Ferrick and Marzo<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9)</xref> reported that suprascapular entrapment neuropathy with ganglion is related to posterior shoulder instability. Dietz et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8)</xref> reported that anterior-inferior labral cyst with an anterior labral tear was related with non-traumatic shoulder instability, and Yukata et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10)</xref> also reported that paralabral cyst of the shoulder was associated with recurrent anterior dislocation. Tirman et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11)</xref> reported that labral cysts may be an indicator of labrocapsular injury and instability, and so taking a careful history and a thorough physical examination to detect instability should be considered. In that report, the physical examination showed glenohumeral instability in the direction of the labral tear and a cystic-appearing mass in 11 patients (11/20, 55%); the instability pattern was multidirectional in three patients and unidirectional in eight patients. Our case was an inferior paralabral cyst with an inferior labral tear. We performed inferior labroplasty combined with rotator interval closure. This cyst was just nearby the axillary nerve, but the postoperative deltoid function was unaffected. So, we suspected that repetitive microtrauma was the main cause of the inferior labral tear and the paralabral cyst. The relationship between shoulder instability and labral tears is well known, yet the association of shoulder instability with a paralabral cyst is rare. We considered that there was the cyclic correlation of shoulder instability, labral tear and paralabral cyst. In the future, we will study the direct relationship between shoulder instability and paralabral cyst.</p>
      <p>Shoulder instability may cause labral injury, or labral injury may cause shoulder instability, and then the injured tear labrum develops a paralabral cyst. In our patient, the inferior paralabral cysts may have been associated with inferior labral tears and instability.</p>
