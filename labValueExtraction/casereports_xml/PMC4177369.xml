      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">Inflammasomes are innate immune sensors that respond to pathogen and damage-associated signals with caspase-1 activation, IL-1&#x3B2; and IL-18 secretion, and macrophage pyroptosis. The discovery that dominant gain-of-function mutations in <italic>NLRP3</italic> cause the Cryopyrin Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) and trigger spontaneous inflammasome activation and IL-1&#x3B2; oversecretion, led to successful treatment with IL-1 blocking agents<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Herein, we report a <italic>de novo</italic> missense mutation, c.1009A&gt;T, p.Thr337Ser, in the nucleotide-binding domain of inflammasome component <italic>NLRC4</italic> (<italic>IPAF/CARD12</italic>) that causes early-onset recurrent fever flares and Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS). Functional analyses demonstrated spontaneous inflammasome formation and production of the inflammasome-dependent cytokines IL-1&#x3B2; and IL-18, the latter exceeding levels in CAPS. The <italic>NLRC4</italic> mutation caused constitutive caspase-1 cleavage in transduced cells and increased production of IL-18 by both patient and <italic>NLRC4</italic> mutant macrophages. Thus, we describe a novel monoallelic inflammasome defect that expands the monogenic autoinflammatory disease spectrum to include MAS and suggests novel targets for therapy.</p>

    <p id="P2">Inflammasomes are platforms that integrate danger recognition with the production of the potent proinflammatory cytokines IL-1&#x3B2; and IL18. The discovery that dominant mutations in the NOD-Like Receptor (NLR) <italic>NLRP3</italic> cause CAPS linked constitutive activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome to human disease<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. At least two other NLR proteins are known to directly assemble IL-1&#x3B2;/IL-18 activating inflammasomes, NLRC4 and NLRP1, but have not been linked to monogenic diseases. Upon activation, these NLR sensors oligomerize and enable the proteolytic activation of caspase-1 through homotypic CARD-CARD interactions<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Active caspase-1 then cleaves proIL-1&#x3B2; and proIL-18 to their active forms and induces pyroptotic cell death through caspase-dependent but IL-1&#x3B2;/IL-18-independent mechanisms<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P3">Dominant mutations in two NLR genes, <italic>NLRP3</italic> and <italic>NOD2</italic>, have previously been associated with the autoinflammatory diseases CAPS and Blau Syndrome, respectively. CAPS presents with fever (often cold-induced), neutrophilic urticaria, and inflammatory hearing loss (familial cold induced autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS): MIM 120100; and Muckle Wells Syndrome (MWS): MIM 191100). The most severe form of CAPS, known as Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID: MIM 607115), is often caused by <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in <italic>NLRP3</italic>, and presents with continuous flares of fever and urticaria, early-onset hearing loss, aseptic meningitis, optic nerve atrophy, and bony overgrowth<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The dramatic response of CAPS symptoms to IL-1&#x3B2; blocking therapies validated the pivotal role of IL-1&#x3B2; in driving the phenotype<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, and guided the successful use of IL-1 inhibition in other autoinflammatory syndromes<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Blau Syndrome (a.k.a. Pediatric Granulomatous Arthritis, MIM 186580) is an early-onset autoinflammatory disorder characterized by granulomatous inflammation of the skin, synovium, and uveal tract<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, and is most commonly associated with inappropriate NF-kB signaling rather than inflammasome activation<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P4">In our protocol investigating and treating patients with early-onset autoinflammatory diseases (NCT00059748), we evaluated a seven-year-old Caucasian female with recurrent episodes of fever, malaise, splenomegaly, vomiting, loose stools with mild duodenitis, and occasional rash beginning at six months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a&#x2013;d</xref>). Fever episodes were initially attributed to recurrent viral infections, but prolonged flares requiring corticosteroid and colchicine treatment and negative evaluations for infection, immunodeficiency, and malignancy suggested an autoinflammatory syndrome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Note</xref> and data not shown). Over time, chronic inflammation and corticosteroid dependence contributed to poor growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). On laboratory evaluation, the combination of elevated inflammatory markers, chronic anemia, transaminitis, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperferritinemia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia with severe flares were not consistent with CAPS but suggestive of Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P5">MAS and the related entity Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) are life-threatening systemic immune dysregulatory conditions associated with uncontrolled macrophage activation and hemophagocytosis<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. MAS/HLH flares present with fevers, pancytopenia, elevated triglycerides, impaired NK cell killing, and very high serum ferritin, and if left untreated can progress to coagulopathy, organ failure, and death. MAS is a known complication of some rheumatic diseases (including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Adult-onset Still&#x2019;s Disease (AOSD), and systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)), but is rarely observed in CAPS or other periodic fever syndromes<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. MAS/HLH can also be triggered by infections (e.g. Epstein-Barr Virus) and malignancies. Insights into the pathogenesis of familial HLH came from genetic discoveries that loss-of-function mutations in <italic>PRF</italic> (encoding perforin) or other genes necessary for perforin/granzyme-mediated killing result in unchecked activation and survival of macrophages and dendritic cells<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. This association has shaped the concept that impaired cytotoxic cell killing drives the pathogenesis of HLH and possibly MAS.</p>
    <p id="P6">NK cell function was normal in our patient, and genetic testing for HLH and for periodic fever syndromes was negative (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Note</xref>). To pursue a molecular diagnosis, she underwent whole exome sequencing (WES), which revealed a heterozygous <italic>de novo</italic> mutation resulting in a p.Thr337Ser substitution in a highly conserved region of the <italic>NLRC4</italic> nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). The variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and predicted to be pathogenic on the basis of conservation, pathogenicity prediction packages<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, and absence from the Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) database of more than 6500 control alleles<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and an in-house collection of &gt;150 exomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Conformational analysis based on the crystal structure of the highly homologous murine <italic>NLRC4</italic> (recently solved by <italic>Hu et al</italic>.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>) suggested that this mutation may destabilize Helical Domain 1 interactions with NBD residues 170 and/or 173, or directly affect ADP binding, any of which may be essential for maintaining NLRC4 in an auto-inhibited conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. A nearby heterozygous <italic>NLRC4</italic> mutation, p.Val341Ala, is reported by <italic>Romberg et al</italic>. to present similarly as recurrent MAS<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P7">We hypothesized that this mutation may result in increased NLRC4 inflammasome activity and NLRC4-mediated MAS (subsequently referred to as NLRC4-MAS). Corroborating this hypothesis, we found a cluster of serum cytokines elevated in NLRC4-MAS but not controls or NOMID patients<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, including the inflammasome-activated cytokine IL-18 (8,316 to 17,355 pg/mL in NLRC4-MAS, 102 to 1,281 pg/mL in NOMID, and 56 to 105 pg/mL in controls, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Comparably high levels of serum IL-18 have also been associated with MAS in systemic JIA<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, AOSD<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, infection<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, and XIAP deficiency<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Other serum markers that clustered distinctly in NLRC4-MAS included macrophage stimulating cytokines (M-CSF, IL-12p40<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>), apoptotic factors (TRAIL, LT&#x3B1;), chemokines (CCL7, CXCL12, IL-16), and hematopoietic growth factors (SCF, IL-3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Transcriptome analysis comparing the NLRC4-MAS patient with NOMID patients and healthy controls similarly showed upregulation of genes associated with apoptosis and dysregulation of genes associated with macrophage activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), particularly in an NLRC4-MAS disease flare sample. These findings are consistent with macrophage stimulation/activation and upregulation of apoptosis and hematopoiesis<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. We also found the calgranulins <italic>S100A8</italic>, <italic>S100A9</italic>, and <italic>S100A12</italic> were among the most highly upregulated genes during an NLRC4-MAS flare, but were minimally upregulated in active NOMID patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Increased calgranulin expression was not associated with granulocytosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). When calgranulins are released from activated monocytes and neutrophils, they act as damage-associated signals to drive pro-inflammatory responses<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. They are particularly elevated in sepsis<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, systemic JIA/AOSD, and Familial Mediterranean Fever, but not CAPS<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, suggesting induction of the calgranulin damage response may help differentiate NLRC4-MAS from NLRP3-driven inflammation.</p>
    <p id="P8">Because <italic>NLRP3</italic> mutations lead to increased inflammasome activation and IL-1&#x3B2;/IL-18 secretion from monocytes and macrophages, we assessed these responses in our patient&#x2019;s cells. Whereas ATP is a canonical trigger of the NLRP3 inflammasome, murine studies suggest that NLRC4 inflammasome activation is triggered by cytosolic flagellin. Unlike Toll-like Receptor 5, which recognizes flagellin at the cell surface, the NLRC4 inflammasome recognizes a distinct region of flagellin that has been injected through a bacterial secretion system (as seen in <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> or <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection)<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. We assessed spontaneous and stimulated responses in patient monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages after priming with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and stimulating with triggers of NLRP3 (ATP) and NLRC4 (intracellular flagellin, IC-FLA) inflammasome activation.</p>
    <p id="P9">As expected, monocytes from the NLRC4-MAS patient and from a NOMID patient (<italic>NLRP3,</italic> G569R) produced significantly more IL-1&#x3B2; and IL-18 with all stimuli than healthy controls, but no difference in IL-1&#x3B2; secretion was seen between NOMID and NLRC4-MAS monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). However, NLRC4-MAS macrophages secreted more IL-1&#x3B2; than NOMID macrophages. Interestingly, IL-18 was constitutively secreted from NLRC4-MAS monocytes and macrophages in contrast to NOMID and healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Upon stimulation, IL-18 was not significantly further upregulated in monocytes but it was significantly upregulated in stimulated macrophages. IL-18 levels were 4&#x2013;5 times higher in stimulated macrophages than monocytes, pointing to activated macrophages as an important source of IL-18. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). IC-FLA-induced cytokine production was sustained with prolonged stimulation, suggesting that the mutation affects both the kinetic and amplitude of the cytokine response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Production of the inflammasome-independent cytokines IL-6, TNF&#x3B1;, and IL-10 was elevated in NLRC4-MAS monocytes compared to healthy and NOMID controls, particularly prior to IL-1 blocking therapy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 6 and 8</xref>). However, these cytokines were not overproduced by matched monocyte-derived macrophages from the NLRC4-MAS patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 6, 7, and 8</xref>). Together, these results suggest increased responsiveness of NLRC4-MAS monocytes, but specific over-production of IL-1&#x3B2; and IL-18 by NLRC4-MAS macrophages, and differential roles for the NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasomes in inducing IL-18 activation and secretion.</p>
    <p id="P10">Inflammasome activation also results in an inflammatory cell death termed pyroptosis<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. To evaluate spontaneous and stimulated cell death, human monocyte-derived macrophages were cultured with or without IC-FLA stimulation and monitored for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Spontaneous cell death was significantly higher in patient macrophages than in healthy controls or NOMID macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Similarly, cell death specifically attributable to IC-FLA stimulation was substantially higher in the patient&#x2019;s macrophages than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P11">Inflammasome activation triggers the oligomerization of Apoptosis-associated Speck-like Protein with CARD domain (ASC/PYCARD) into aggregates that are necessary for caspase-1 activation and cytokine production<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> in a process that can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. We assessed spontaneous and stimulated ASC aggregation in NLRC4-MAS and control monocyte-derived macrophages. NLRC4-MAS macrophages displayed spontaneous ASC aggregation that was not substantially altered by LPS and/or IC-FLA stimulation, whereas control macrophages showed stimulation-dependent ASC aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d,e</xref>). These results corroborate constitutive inflammasome activation in NLRC4-MAS macrophages.</p>
    <p id="P12">To investigate the activating effect of the <italic>NLRC4</italic> mutation, we stably transduced WT or T337S mutant <italic>NLRC4</italic> constructs, or empty vector (EV) virus into THP1 myelomonocytic cells and assessed inflammasome activity. THP1 cell expression of mutNLRC4 was consistently less than WT, despite infecting with up to 200 fold more mutant than WT virus, suggesting a proliferative disadvantage of mutant-transduced cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Despite lower NLRC4 expression, we measured increased spontaneous caspase-1 cleavage in mutNLRC4-transduced THP1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Macrophages derived from mutNLRC4-transduced THP1 cells also showed enhanced secretion of IL-1&#x3B2; (mutNLRC4=5.5&#x2013;10.6 fold over EV versus wtNLRC4=2.4&#x2013;5.9 fold over EV, p=0.01) and IL-18 (mutNLRC4=5.2&#x2013;11.4 fold over EV versus wtNLRC4=2.1&#x2013;6.7 fold over EV, p=0.03) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). These findings support gain-of-function of the <italic>NLRC4</italic> mutation through constitutive caspase-1 activation.</p>
    <p id="P13">Given the successful use of IL-1 blocking strategies in <italic>NLRP3</italic>-mediated diseases<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, the patient began treatment with recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra). The patient&#x2019;s flare frequency, C-reactive protein, splenomegaly and prednisone dose were substantially reduced following IL-1 blocking therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b,c</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Note</xref>). After 7 months of treatment, the patient has had no fevers or clinical flares and has weaned off corticosteroids and colchicine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). She has had no treatment-related adverse events, but has had transient transaminitis and elevated LDH and ferritin levels following a brief viral illness.

The presence of similar activating mutations in these NLRs, the strong species conservation of the NBD domain, and the role of the NBD in mediating autoinhibition<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> support constitutive NLR oligomerization as an important mechanism in these three diseases. Unlike in CAPS/NOMID patients, the <italic>NLRC4</italic> mutation in our patient causes very high circulating and stimulated levels of IL-18, similar to levels seen in other MAS-prone conditions<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. The factors and molecular mechanisms that differentially regulate NLRC4 versus NLRP3 inflammasome activation are largely unknown and require further study. In addition, IL-18 production by non-hematopoietic cells (osteoblasts, adrenal cortex, intestinal epithelia, etc.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>) may incrementally contribute to the constitutively high serum IL-18 levels in NLRC4-MAS versus CAPS patients.</p>
    <p id="P15">Our functional data are consistent with a gain-of-function of the NLRC4 protein and support the mechanism of pathogenic macrophage activation with IL-1&#x3B2; and IL-18 overproduction and increased pyroptosis. Our data suggest for the first time that a macrophage-intrinsic defect can drive the MAS phenotype in the absence of a primary cytotoxic defect, thus providing a new paradigm for the pathogenesis of MAS. Activating mutations in <italic>NLRC4</italic> cause a novel autoinflammatory disease presenting as periodic fever syndrome with MAS, distinct from CAPS and Blau Syndrome, and partially responsive to IL-1 inhibition. The persistence of high serum IL-18 levels and macrophage hyper-responsiveness even after IL-1 blocking treatment suggest a role for IL-18 in MAS and warrant an exploration of IL-18 as a therapeutic target.</p>

Sequencing was performed on Illumina&#xAE; HiSeq sequencers (Illumina, San Diego, CA) using 2&#xD7;100 bp paired reads. The typical average on-target coverage is about 66&#xD7;. A computational pipeline was developed to process the read data and perform tasks such as quality control (QC), variant discovery, annotation and filtering. Briefly, the sequencing reads in FASTQ format were aligned to the human reference genome (GRC B37) with the BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner) mapping tool. The resulting BAM files (one per sample) were further processed to remove duplicate reads, refine alignment around indels and recalibrate base quality scores, according to the best practice guideline by the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) from the Broad Institute. A variant caller (UnifiedGenotyper) from GATK was used to make joint variant calls across multiple samples, followed by a variant quality score recalibration step by the GATK VQSR tool. Besides quality scores, the variants were annotated with functional impact and allele frequency in public databases and local datasets. Sample relationship and gender were checked to identify potential sample mix-up and false family relationship. Likely disease-causing mutations were selected and prioritized based on quality score, allele frequency, functional impact, probable inheritance model (de novo mutation, autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked), and expert evaluation.</p>

        <p id="P36">(<bold>a</bold>) We performed multiplex cytokine analysis on serum from the NLRC4-MAS patient, healthy pediatric controls, the patient&#x2019;s family, and NOMID patients. NLRC4-MAS patient samples were obtained at seven distinct timepoints over the course of 10 months. Paired NOMID samples were obtained from six patients during both clinically active and inactive disease. No serum sample during a clinical flare from the NLRC4-MAS patient was available for cytokine analysis. Values represent the mean of two technical replicates per sample. Hierarchical clustering was performed on cytokine values normalized to the mean value across all samples. The magnitude of serum IL-1&#x3B2; and IL-18 concentrations are shown below. Horizontal white lines separate disease groups and vertical white lines indicate cytokines that form the NLRC4-MAS signature.
