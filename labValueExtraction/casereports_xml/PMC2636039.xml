        <p>We report an atypical presentation of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(NHL) in a child aged 18 months who presented with rapidly
progressive bilateral proptosis. Computerized search using
Medline did not reveal a similar presentation of NHL in such a
young child. It stresses the need for an early histopathological
study including immunohistochemistry and demonstrates
the dramatic local response to combined radiotherapy and
chemotherapy even in advanced stages without any ocular side-
effects.</p>

  <body>
    <p>There has been a progressive increase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> in the incidence of
lymphoma over the years with frequent reports of varying
and atypical presentations and a bewildering number of
confusing classifications which still do not fit all the cases.
This is especially true with respect to non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(NHL). This case report discusses the difficulties encountered in
diagnosis, the need for an early incisional biopsy and a complete
immunohistopathological study with all the markers. It also highlights the fact that lymphomas respond dramatically to combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy.</p>
    <sec sec-type="">
      <title>Case History</title>
      <p>An 18-month-old female child presented with a history of
rapidly increasing prominence of both eyes of two months
duration. It was first noticed in the left eye, the right eye was
involved two to three days later. The child had occasional fever
and did not have any major eye or systemic disease before the
onset of prominence of the eyes. Her brother, five years old,
was healthy.</p>
      <p>The child weighed 9 kg and was afebrile. Examination of the
eyes revealed an axial proptosis which measured 22 mm right
and 23 mm left eye at an outer intercanthal distance of 82 mm.
Lid edema, prominent vessels over the lids and lagophthalmos
were more pronounced in the left than the right eye [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>].
There was gross congestion and chemosis of the conjunctiva
and exposure keratitis in the left eye. The conjunctiva was
mildly congested in right eye and the cornea was clear. Ocular
motility was restricted in all directions of gaze in both eyes.
Pupils were normal and reactive in both the eyes and vision
appeared normal. Fundus examination of right eye revealed
a normal optic disc but the left eye showed an edematous
disc. Based on clinical findings, neuroblastoma, granulocytic
sarcoma, multifocal eosinophilic granuloma and inflammatory
pseudotumor were considered in the differential diagnosis.</p>
      <p>Blood examination revealed hemoglobin of 10.9 gm%,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 35 mm, bleeding time
of 1 min 25 sec and clotting time of 7 min 02 sec and blood
counts were normal. Peripheral blood smear showed microcytic
hypochromic picture without any abnormal or atypical cells and
adequate platelets. Routine ENT and pediatric referral did not
reveal any abnormality. Chest X-ray was normal. Computerized
tomography [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>] showed diffuse infiltration of the orbit and
erosion of medial wall of the orbit bordering the nose and lateral
wall of the nose bordering the infratemporal fossa on both sides.
Adjacent paranasal sinuses were normal. A malignant lesion
was suspected and orbital biopsy was advised.</p>
      <p>An incisional biopsy was done from both orbits to confirm
a single bilateral etiology. Histopathological sections [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>]
study showed solid sheets of predominantly undifferentiated
cells along with a few interspersed elongated and fusiform
cells with central nucleus and eosinophilic cytoplasm. The
undifferentiated cells were round to elongated with large
pleomorphic nucleus and prominent single to multiple nucleoli
with numerous atypical mitosis. Amidst these there were also
a few vacuolated cells. These features favored the diagnosis of
undifferentiated rhabdomyosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry
was advised to confirm the diagnosis. Bone marrow was
positive for malignant cells and cerebrospinal fluid showed
metastasis to the brain. Ultrasound scan of the abdomen and
pelvis showed hepatomegaly with multiple small hypoechoic
lesions. Renal function tests were normal. Serum calcium (12
mg/dl) and phosphorus (7 mg/dl) were slightly higher than
normal. Liver function tests were normal except serum alanine
transaminasae (50 U/L).</p>
      <p>In consultation with an oncologist a multimodal treatment
was planned with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. As the
patient&#x2032;s left eye was at risk due to exposure keratitis and
papilledema, it was decided to start local external beam
irradiation followed by chemotherapy. A total of 46 cGy with
180 cGy per fraction were given over a period of five weeks.
Lens was shielded from exposure to radiation. Chemotherapy
was planned as per IRS-IV protocol with injection vincristine
1.5 mg/ m<sup>2</sup> IV weekly for 12 weeks and on Week 16, injection
dactinomycin 0.015 mg/Kg/day from Day 1 to Day 5, every
three weeks up to 16 weeks, injection cyclophosphamide 2.2
g/m<sup>2</sup> with mesna 440mg/m<sup>2</sup> for one day per cycle every three
weeks up to 16 weeks. Chemotherapy was interrupted due to
anemia and low neutrophil counts requiring blood transfusion.
Proptosis completely disappeared, the exposure keratitis of
the left eye healed and disc edema totally subsided 2.5 months
after starting therapy [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>]. Patient did not have any visual
deficit in either eye. Unfortunately, patient expired 6.5 months
after she was first seen in our hospital due to central nervous
system infiltration. She did not develop any complications due
to radiation during her follow-up.</p>
      <p>As this was an unusual presentation, tissue block was sent
for immunohistochemistry with an academic interest. The
markers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> used were Cytokeratin (epithelial tumors), Vimentin
(mesenchyme-derived neoplasms including lymphomas,
melanomas, some sarcomas and certain neural tumors),
Leukocyte Common Antigen (lymphoma), CD20 and CD79A
(B-cell neoplasms), CD3, CD43 and CD 99 (T-cell neoplasms),
CD 30 (anaplastic large cell lymphoma and Hodgkin disease),
Desmin (rhabdomyosarcoma), Synaptophysin (neuroblastoma),
Myeloperoxidase (granulocytic sarcoma), HMB45 (melanoma),
TDT (lymphoblastic lymphomas and leukemia) and Ki-67
(proliferation-related marker). It was negative for all markers
except Vimentin and Leukocyte Common Antigen [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>]. KI
67 was 60 to 70% positive. The immunohistochemistry report
was unclassifiable high-grade NHL.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Lymphomas are solid malignant neoplasms that originate
from leukocytes, mostly lymphocytes, dendritic histiocytes
and plasma cells. Lymphoma occurs most commonly in lymph
nodes and primary lymphoid tissue but also in extranodal
sites, including the orbit, skin oropharynx, gastrointestinal
tract and bone marrow. Systemic NHL in adults is usually
seen in the fifth or sixth decade and presentation in childhood
is extremely rare.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></p>
      <p>Most orbital lymphomas are NHL and tend to present in the
sixth and seventh decade and present anteriorly in the orbit.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
Presentation before the age of 20 is rare.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> In one reported case
series,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> although NHL was the most frequent malignant tumor
of the eye and ocular adnexae (55%), the youngest patient was
15-years-old (15 to 96) and the median age was 71 years.</p>
      <p>In another review<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> of 145 patients of lymphoma orbit and/
adnexa and/ocular, the youngest patient was three-years-old
(three to 96 years) and the median age was 66 years and 10%
were bilateral. Exophthalmia was seen in 27%. Kodsi <italic>et al</italic>. in
their review of 340 orbital tumors in children found only 18.2%
of them to be malignant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> (11.5% primary and 6.8% metastatic).
Among 62 malignant tumors rhabdomyosarcoma (24) was the
most common malignant neoplasm, with lymphoma (five)
much less frequent.</p>
      <p>Most of the lymphomas of the eye and its adnexa are NHL of
B-cell type.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> Computed tomography demonstrates the molding
of the mass to orbital structures, such as the globe and orbital
bones, without bony erosion except in large cell lymphoma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></p>
      <p>Radiotherapy is effective in indolent forms and chemotherapy
is applied in aggressive lymphomas and a combination of radio-
and chemotherapy may even be more effective.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> The presence
of bilateral involvement, extension to the subcutaneous
tissue or temporalis fossa is associated with increased risk of
dissemination.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> Higher grade and destruction of orbital wall
suggest a poor prognosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></p>
      <p>In conclusion, it was a rare presentation of a primary
orbital NHL in a child aged 18 months presenting as rapidly
progressive bilateral axial proptosis with an early metastasis. In
this case the tumor was so poorly differentiated that it couldn&#x2032;t
be classified.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> Bony erosion of orbital and nasal wall instead
of molding to the adjoining structures was seen. There was
no radiation-induced complication in the eye with the dosage
given, over a follow-up period of 6.5 months.</p>
