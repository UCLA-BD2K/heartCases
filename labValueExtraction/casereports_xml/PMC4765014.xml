    <p><bold>Clinical data:</bold> the characteristic signs of the scimitar syndrome with right
pulmonary hypoplasia were discovered in an asymptomatic patient through routine chest
X-ray, in the presence of dengue.</p>
    <p>On physical examination, the patient was in good general health status, eupneic, normal
skin color, with normal pulses. His weight was 54 kg, height 155 cm, blood pressure of
100/60 mmHg, heart rate of 88 bpm.</p>
    <p>The aorta was not palpable at the sternal notch. In the precordium, there were mild
impulses at the left and right sternal borders and the apex beat was not palpable. Heart
sounds were normal, with constant splitting of the second heart sound, with discreet and
rough ejection systolic murmur in the pulmonary area.</p>
    <p>The liver was not palpable and in the lungs, breath sounds were less audible in the right
lower pulmonary lobe.</p>

      <title>Complementary tests</title>
      <p><bold>The Electrocardiogram</bold> showed sinus rhythm and signs of final conduction
disturbance in the right branch with rSr' complex in V1. There were no signs of
cavity overload. AP: +70, AQRS: + 80&#xBA;, AT: + 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

      <p><bold>The Chest X-ray</bold> disclosed right lung hypoplasia, dextroposition of the
heart as a result of it and the classic sign of anomalous pulmonary vein drainage to
the right, with scimitar aspect. The pulmonary vasculature to the left was slightly
more prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
      <p><bold>The Echocardiogram</bold> showed enlargement of the right heart chambers,
pulmonary arteries and right pulmonary vein drainage into the right atrium at its
lower portion, near the inferior vena cava.</p>
      <p><bold>The CT angiography</bold> disclosed the same aspect, in addition to the obvious
systemic-pulmonary collateral circulation from the descending aorta into the right
lower pulmonary lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

      <p><bold>Diagnosis:</bold> Scimitar syndrome with right pulmonary vein drainage into the
right atrium with moderate repercussion and pulmonary sequestration in
systemic-pulmonary circulation of the descending aorta into the right lower
lobe.</p>
      <p><bold>Clinical reasoning:</bold> the scimitar syndrome, due to the anomalous right
pulmonary vein drainage, is clinically manifested as a simple atrial septal defect,
with the described classic signs, few symptoms, ejection murmur in the pulmonary
area, splitting of the second heart sound and right ventricular diastolic overload
on the electrocardiogram. The scimitar sign on the chest X-ray easily characterizes
the diagnosis of the syndrome, as this diagnosis had been established in this case.
Hence, the importance of this complementary radiographic assessment, simple and
definitive, to achieve a diagnostic conclusion of this defect.</p>
      <p><bold>Differential diagnosis:</bold> the scimitar syndrome shows no diagnostic
difficulties in comparison to other defects, as it has a characteristic and unique
radiographic sign.</p>
      <p><bold>Conduct:</bold> the diagnostic confirmation by cardiac catheterization was
scheduled, in addition to the embolization of the systemic-pulmonary vessel, and
subsequently, the surgical repair of the anomalous right pulmonary vein drainage was
performed. The hemodynamic study showed normal pressures in the heart chambers and
arteries (RA = 8, RV = 25/8, PT = 25 / 15-20, Ao = 98 / 58-70 mmHg). Arterial
saturation was 100% in the aorta. The angiography showed a large pulmonary venous
vessel to the right, quite dilated, which drained into the low right atrium. The
injection of contrast into the descending aorta showed an arterial vessel going into
the right lower lobe after mild stenosis in its proximal third. It was totally
occluded after the placement of three coils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure
2</xref>).</p>
      <p>At the cardiac surgery, after starting the cardiopulmonary bypass, the interatrial
septum was partially resected and the right pulmonary vein flow was redirected into
the left atrium using a bovine pericardium patch.</p>
      <p>The postoperative course was uneventful, with disappearance of the heart murmur.</p>
      <p><bold>Comments:</bold> In classic scimitar syndrome, it is known that drainage of the
anomalous pulmonary veins of the right lung in the shape of a scimitar (curved
Turkish sword) is directed into the inferior vena cava, with a higher or lower
degree of right lung hypoplasia, with or without pulmonary sequestration by the
systemic-pulmonary vessel of the aorta to the right lower lobe, as well as
dextroposition of the heart. <sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Most cases are not associated with
other defects (75%) and this syndrome shows two different types: the one identified
in children (with dynamic repercussions) and the adult type (with less impact of
volume overload, related to the degree of right pulmonary hypoplasia). However, the
drainage into the right atrium of the right pulmonary veins, while maintaining the
scimitar shape is little known. After searching the literature since 1966, we did
not find any similar cases to the one described here, with drainage of the anomalous
vein directly into the right atrium and the classic scimitar sign. This peculiarity
of the scimitar shape persists due to the proximity of the drainage in the lower
right atrium, near the inferior vena cava. In this context, there have been reported
cases of the scimitar sign, but with normal drainage of the right pulmonary vein
into the left atrium itself.<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Thus,
we currently know the "characteristic scimitar syndrome" and the "scimitar sign" -
the latter not associated with the anomalous pulmonary vein drainage or associated
with anomalous drainage at another site, such as in the right atrium, for
instance.</p>
