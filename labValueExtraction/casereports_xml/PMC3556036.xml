      <abstract>
        <p>Dubowitz Syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder with a unique set of clinical features including microcephaly and susceptibility to tumor formation. Although more than 140 cases of Dubowitz syndrome have been reported since 1965, the genetic defects of this disease has not been identified. In this study, we systematically analyzed the DNA damage response and repair capability of fibroblasts established from a Dubowitz Syndrome patient. Dubowitz syndrome fibroblasts are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation, bleomycin, and doxorubicin. However, they have relatively normal sensitivities to mitomycin-C, cisplatin, and camptothecin. Dubowitz syndrome fibroblasts also have normal DNA damage signaling and cell cycle checkpoint activations after DNA damage. These data implicate a defect in repair of DNA double strand break (DSB) likely due to defective non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). We further sequenced several genes involved in NHEJ, and identified a pair of novel compound mutations in the DNA Ligase IV gene. Furthermore, expression of wild type DNA ligase IV completely complement the DNA repair defects in Dubowitz syndrome fibroblasts, suggesting that the DNA ligase IV mutation is solely responsible for the DNA repair defects. These data suggests that at least subset of Dubowitz syndrome can be attributed to DNA ligase IV mutations.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Dubowitz Syndrome, firstly reported in 1965, is an autosomal recessive disorder with a unique set of clinical features, including microcephaly, short statures, mild mental retardation, eczema, distinct facial features, etc. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Dubowitz1">[1]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Huber1">[5]</xref> The genetic base of Dubowitz syndrome has not been elucidated, although chromosome 13q micro-deletion or duplication has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Maas1">[6]</xref>. Some Dubowitz syndrome patients have elevated chromosome breakages and tumor formations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Antoniades1">[7]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-AlNemri1">[11]</xref>, implying potential defects in DNA repair. While certain Dubowitz syndrome cases have abnormal production of immunoglobulins, but many other cases did not display immunoglobulin deficiency at young ages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Antoniades1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Turkbeyler1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Liu1">[12]</xref>. Bone marrow failures have been reported in a few cases of Dubowitz syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Berthold1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Walters1">[14]</xref>. These clinical phenotypes overlap with some of the DNA repair deficient syndromes such as Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS) syndrome, Fanconi anemia, DNA ligase IV syndrome, Bloom's syndrome, etc. But direct evidence for DNA repair defects in Dubowitz syndrome has not been reported.</p>
      <p>In this study, we report the cellular and genetic characterization of a Dubowitz syndrome patient who was diagnosed in 1973 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Opitz1">[3]</xref>, and developed anal cancer later. We established a fibroblast cell line, and we found that the fibroblasts are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and several other DNA damage agents, due to the defect in the repair of DNA double strand break (DSB) as a result of DNA Ligase IV mutations. We suggest that defective DNA repair contributes to development of at least a subset of Dubowitz Syndrome, offering a molecular base for this poorly understood inheritable disease. This new finding will be valuable to guide treatment selection for Dubowitz Syndrome patients with cancer.</p>

        <title>Identification of a radiation sensitive patient with Dubowitz syndrome</title>
        <p>A one-year old female patient was diagnosed with Dubowitz syndrome in 1973 by Optiz et al. due to typical clinical features of Dubowitz syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Opitz1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Orrison1">[15]</xref>. At age of 34 years, she presented with bright red blood per rectum. Colonoscopy revealed a 5 cm ulcerative mass located at the posterior rectum just inside the anal verge. Biopsy was positive for squamous cell carcinoma. Due to her multiple medical issues, including low platelets, low white count, anemia, the patient was not felt to be a candidate for surgery or chemotherapy. After discussion with the family and other members of the multidisciplinary medical team it was decided to proceed with limited field radiation therapy alone directed at the lower rectum and anal region. After only 10 treatments of 200 cGy fractions per day to a small anterior and posterior radiation field directed at the anal/lower rectal region, the patient developed severe moist desquamation in the per-rectal, vaginal and pubic region. Over the ensuing several weeks the patient severe moist desquamation gradually healed, with significant residual induration and fibrosis in the region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054389-g001">Figure 1</xref>). There was approximately a 50% regression of the tumor by physical examination during this time. The patient died of widespread cancer metastasis and failed local cancer control.</p>

        <title>Establishment of a primary fibroblast cell line for the Dubowitz syndrome</title>
        <p>To facilitate the identification of the genetic defects of Dubowitz syndrome, we established primary dermal fibroblasts, designated CoDa from autopsy skin tissues (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for procedures of establishing the primary couture). Early passages of CoDa cells were used for growth property analysis along with a normal primary fibroblast control line FBCL as the control. The CoDa cells displayed typical fibroblast morphology in primary culture, and have comparable growth properties and cell cycle distribution as normal skin fibroblasts at log-phase of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054389-g002">Figs. 2a and 2b</xref>).</p>

        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054389-g002">Figure 2c</xref>, both cells have population doubling time of &#x223C;30 hours. The CoDa cells maintain stable growth rate for up to passage 25 in continuous <italic>in vitro</italic> culture, similar as control fibroblast FBCL cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054389-g002">Figure 2d</xref>, the plating efficiency (PE) for both cells is around 30&#x2013;34% at early passages, and gradually decreases as the passage numbers increase. Collectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054389-g002">Figure 2</xref> suggests that the CoDa cells have similar growth properties as the normal control cell line.</p>

        <title>Radiation sensitivity of the Dubowitz syndrome fibroblasts</title>
        <p>To confirm the radiation sensitivity of the CoDa cells, we performed colony formation assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054389-g003">Figure 3a</xref>, the CoDa cells are &#x223C;30 fold more sensitive to ionizing radiation than normal fibroblasts at the dose of 2 Gy (0.99% survival of CoDa cells vs. 29.7% survival for normal fibroblasts). To achieve 10% of survival fraction, it takes 3.49 Gy of &#x3B3;-irradiation for normal fibroblasts, but it takes only 1.08 Gy for CoDa cells. Because the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSB) is the most dominant determinant affecting cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation, and phosphorylated histone H2AX (&#x3B3;H2AX) is a reliable surrogate marker for DSB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Rogakou1">[16]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Pilch1">[19]</xref>, we measured the kinetics of &#x3B3;H2AX nuclear foci following 2 Gy of &#x3B3;-irradiation. The number of foci per cell increased to a similar level in CoDa and control cells shortly after 2 Gy irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054389-g003">Fig. 3b, c</xref>), suggesting that irradiation induced a similar level of initial amount of DNA damage in these cells. However, there is a significant delay in the clearance of &#x3B3;H2AX foci among CoDa cells than the control fibroblasts. The same extend of initial activation but delayed clearance of &#x3B3;H2AX was confirmed by western blot after 2 Gy of irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054389-g003">Fig. 3d</xref>). By 24 hours after irradiation, there was still a significant level of &#x3B3;H2AX in CoDa cells, while the intensity of &#x3B3;H2AX signal in the control cells returned to the basal level.</p>

        <p>The 53BP1 protein is recruited to DNA damage sites and forms nuclear foci in response to DSBs. We also measured the kinetics of 53BP1 nuclear focus formation in CoDa cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054389-g004">Figure 4a</xref> shows the average number of 53BP1 nuclear foci among three CoDa cell population (CoDa-2, CoDa-21, and CoDa-33) and three normal fibroblasts (FBCL, HSF42, and HSF43). It is clear that, similar as &#x3B3;H2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054389-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), the CoDa cells have normal initial 53BP1 focus formation in response to ionizing radiation but a slower removal of the 53BP1 foci after IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054389-g004">Fig. 4a</xref>). Significantly more 53BP1 foci can be detected in CoDa cells than control cells even at 24 hours after 2 Gy irradiation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054389-g004">Figure 4b</xref> shows representative images of 53BP1 foci.</p>

Nocodazole treatment arrests cells in M phase, thus the progresses of G1 phase cells in the cell cycle can be visualized by gradual decrease of G1 population.

        <p>Histone-3 is phosphorylated at Serine-10 when the cells exit G2-phase and enter into mitosis. To test whether CoDa cells have functional G2/M checkpoint, the phosphorylated histone-3 (phosphor-H3) was stained at various time points after irradiation and nocodazole trapping. The percentages of phosphor-H3 positive cells were scored by flow cytometer. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054389-g005">Figure 5b</xref>, there is a similar delay of mitotic index initially after 6 Gy-irradiation in both control and CoDa cells. This indicates that both cells have normal G2/M check point activation. At about 24 hours after irradiation, the G2 phase cells of normal fibroblasts start to enter into mitosis. However, the CoDa cell remains arrested at G2, event up to 32 hours after IR, suggesting a delay in recovery of G2 arrest in CoDa cells. This is consistent with the delay of DSB repair in CoDa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054389-g003">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054389-g004">4</xref>).</p>

The 613&#x394;T (L205FS) mutation has never been reported. It codes a protein containing only part of the DNA binding domain of LIG4 and appears to be the shortest truncation of LIG4 reported so far. Two nuclear localization signals (NLS) have been identified in LIG4, located at the C-terminus of the protein near the first BRCT motif. The novel mutation we identified in <italic>LIG4</italic> gene, 613&#x394;T (L205FS), only contains part of DNA binding domain without either of NLS, and most likely will result in the nonsense-mediated decay.

      <p>In 1965, a 13-month-old female patient was reported by Victor Dubowitz with unique clinical features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Dubowitz1">[1]</xref>. Several years later, Opitz and Grosse et al. further defined the clinical features and proposed the designation of Dubowitz syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Grosse1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Opitz1">[3]</xref>. In this report, the patient was diagnosed in 1973 at one-year-old age, and she was one of the cases used to define the common clinical features of Dubowitz Syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Opitz1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We established fibroblast cell lines from this patient and the availability of the cell lines provides us with the opportunity to characterize the DNA repair defects and to identify its genetic defects. This is the first time to our best knowledge, that the genetic defects of Dubowitz syndromes are identified, despite the fact that Dubowitz syndrome has been originally reported in 1965. Among Dubowitz syndrome cases described in literature, few of them were evaluated on molecular level. A case of high frequency of chromosome breaks in the lymphocytes of two sister-and-brother siblings with Dubowitz Syndrome after nitrogen mustard and diepoxybutane treatments was reported in 1991 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Thuret1">[9]</xref>. Another report mentioned a high rate of chromosome breakage in a case of Dubowitz syndrome with embryonic rhabdomyosarcoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-AlNemri1">[11]</xref>. Although those reports have implicated DNA repair defects in Dubowitz Syndrome, it is until now that the direct evidence of DNA repair defects is found.</p>
      <p>The knowledge that <italic>LIG4</italic> mutation is responsible for the disease should have significant clinical impact for the care of similar Dubowitz syndrome patients. Because CoDa cells from our patient are sensitive to ionizing radiation, bleomycin, and topoisomerase II poison, but not sensitive to DNA cross-link agents or topoisomerase I poison. Thus, DNA crosslinking agents such as mitomycin C and cisplatin, or Topo I poisons camptothecin and topotecan, should be the preferred choices for those patients with cancer. Ionizing radiation, bleomycin and doxorubicin should be avoided to reduce the severe side effect. In addition, our finding also offers molecular bases to manage the immunological defects as reported in some of the Dubowitz syndrome cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Antoniades1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Turkbeyler1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Dubowitz syndrome was described in 1965 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Dubowitz1">[1]</xref>. It has been implied that Dubowitz syndrome may have some clinical overlap with other DNA repair defective inheritable diseases, including Bloom's syndrome and DNA ligase IV syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Gruhn1">[25]</xref>. DNA ligase IV mutation was firstly reported in a radiation sensitive leukemia patient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Riballo1">[26]</xref>, and DNA ligase IV syndrome was soon formally proposed in 2001 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-ODriscoll1">[24]</xref>. However, ligase IV syndrome is a disorder genetically defined by the mutations on the <italic>Ligase IV</italic> gene. On the other hand, Dubowitz syndrome is a diagnosis based on clinical features, but not by genetics. The term of &#x201C;Dubowitz syndrome&#x201D; was coined many years before Ligase IV syndrome was introduced into the scientific field. Our study suggested that some of the Dubowitz syndrome patients diagnosed prior to the awareness of Ligase IV syndrome might be contributed by Ligase IV mutations genetically, and that a subset of Dubowiz syndrome is the same as DNA ligase IV syndrome. This finding puts Dubowitz syndrome and DNA ligase IV syndrome into the same molecular group for future diagnosis and treatment planning.</p>

In each well, 7&#x2013;10 small tissue fragments were evenly distributed over the culture surface. The tissue blocks were incubated in 37&#xB0;C incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 4 hours to allow tissue pieces to be settled. Then, 1 ml of complete growth medium was carefully added into each well without disturbing the tissue blocks. Complete growth medium is composed of &#x3B1;-MEM cell culture medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma) and 0.2 mM glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin. The medium was replaced after 5 days and replaced every 3 days thereafter. When the fibroblasts grown from the tissue fragments were nearly confluent, the tissue blocks were removed and the cells were trypsinized and re-plated into 6-cm Petri dishes, which was designated as passage 1. The established primary fibroblasts were named as CoDa, the initials of the patient. Several independent populations of fibroblast lines (CoDa-2, CoDa-25, and CoDa-33) were established from independent wells of culture plates. Passaging and subculture of CoDa cells were performed with 1&#x2236;3 dilution when the cells reached &#x223C;90% confluence.</p>

        <title>Determinations of cell population doubling time and plating efficiency</title>
        <p>To determine the population doubling time of the cells, 1.8&#xD7;10<sup>5</sup> viable log-phase cells were seeded into 60 mm culture dish at day 0. After 24 hours of incubation (Day 1), 3 dishes of cells were trypsinized and cell number was counted. The average cell number from 3 dishes was recorded as N1. At day 3, the average cell number from another 3 dishes was determined and recorded as N2. The following formula was used to calculate doubling time (Td): <italic><underline>Td&#x200A;=&#x200A;T*log2/log(N2/N1),</underline></italic> where T is the time between two counting. To determine the plate efficiency (PE), 300 log-phase cells were seeded into 100 mm culture dishes and medium was changed every 4&#x2013;5 days. After 15 days of culture, the number of colonies was counted in culture dish after stained with 1% crystal violate in absolute methanol. PE was calculated as the percentage of average colony number over total number of cells seeded. Doubling time and PE were measured every 3&#x2013;4 passages.</p>

          <p><bold>CoDa cells have normal RAD51and phosphorylated DNA-PKcs focus formation.</bold> RAD51 focus formation in response to DNA damage is a hallmark of active HR machinery. Failure or delay in forming RAD51 foci would signal an impaired HR process. To integrate whether the homologous recombinational repair pathway is affected in CoDa cells, we performed immunostaining of RAD51 foci in CoDa cells. At various time points after the cells were treated with 2 Gy &#x3B3;-radiation, cells were fixed and stained by immunoflurescent techniques with an anti-RAD51 antibody. The number of RAD51 foci was counted in &gt;200 cells per time point in each experiment. Panel (a) shows the numbers of RAD51 foci per cell in FBCL and CoDa cells. Data shown are averages and standard deviations of three experiments. As shown in panel S1a, similar numbers of RAD51 foci were formed in both control and CoDa cells and reached the peak at about 4 hours after IR. However, the removal of RAD51 foci in CoDa cell is slower in CoDa than that in FBCL cells. There was no change of RAD51 protein levels in CoDa cells compared with that in control cells (Data not shown). In addition, the level of RNF8, an ubiquitin E3 ligase involved in repair proteins recruitment and the FANCD2 mono-ubiquitylation was not affected in CoDa cells (Data not shown). These data suggest that HR pathway is not likely affected in CoDa cells. Panel (b) are representative images of phosphorylated DNA-PKcs staining. The cells were fixed 1 hour after 2 Gy IR treatment and processed for immunostaining with anti-phosphorylated DNA-PKcs (T2609) antibody. Cells were treated with 0.5% triton X-100 for 5 min on ice, then fixed with 4% PPBS. Shown in panel b, the green channel is for phosphorylated DNA-PKcs and DAPI staining (Blue) represents the location of nuclear. Similar number of foci was observed in CoDa and control cells. This result indicates normal early events of NHEJ, and further suggests the normal ATM signaling in CoDa cells, which is consistent with the phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at T2609 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0054389-Chen1">[35]</xref>.</p>
