      <abstract>
        <p>We present three cases of unusual corneal/conjunctival foreign bodies that were not visible on standard slit lamp examination. All patients presented with complaints of foreign body sensation in the affected eyes. One patient had visited an ophthalmologist prior to presentation to our center and was diagnosed and treated for conjunctivitis. On slit lamp examination minimal congestion was seen hence, all the patients were diagnosed with conjunctivitis with corneal epithelial defects by the residents. However, because the patients complained of foreign body sensation, fluorescein staining of the affected eye was performed. On examination, the corneas had epithelial defects and linear scratch marks. We suspected a foreign body in upper palpebral conjunctiva (UPC). Examination after eyelid eversion indicated tripod-shaped glassy foreign bodies embedded deep within the UPC. We present cases of an unusual type of glassy tripod-shaped foreign body which may go undetected even on slit lamp examination. Fluorescein staining may aid in the detection of these foreign bodies.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Foreign body sensation in the eye can be due the occasional eyelash that lands inadvertently on the corneal surface to an impact from a high-speed missile of an ejected metal shard. Depending on object the type of injury, the foreign body may penetrate the globe causing serious injury or it may simply resolve without any long-term sequalae.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p>
      <p>Small foreign bodies such as steel, coal or sand may often impact the corneal or conjunctival surface.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p>
      <p>They may be washed along the tear film into the lacrimal drainage system or adhere to the superior tarsal conjunctiva and abrade the cornea with each blink. In such cases the pathognomonic pattern of linear corneal abrasions may be seen.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p>
      <p>Since the conjunctival sac is exposed to the atmosphere, foreign bodies of various types may enter into it.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The type of foreign bodies that were reported in the conjunctival sac were vast as it is the most common accident occurring in daily life.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>

        <title>Case 1</title>
        <p>A 56-year-old male complained of foreign body sensation in the left eye lasting for 4 days. There was no history of foreign body entering the eye. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 6/6 OD, 6/9 OS. On ophthalmic examination, the external adnexa was within normal limits, the bulbar conjunctiva was normal, the cornea showed a small epithelial defect, the palpebral conjunctiva was unremarkable [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>]. Fluorescein staining indicated a corneal epithelial defect [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>]. The eyelid was everted for examination of the upper palpebral conjunctiva (UPC) with showed pooling of dye around a tripod-shaped glassy foreign body [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">e</xref>].</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>In the three cases reported here, we noted the presence of linear abrasions with epithelial defects on cornea suggestive of a foreign body lodged in upper palpebral conjunctiva.</p>
      <p>In most instances if no foreign body is noticed on upper lid eversion, we assumed that the foreign body may have been dislodged and washed along the tear film into the lacrimal drainage system. However, in these cases a meticulous examination showed the presence of tripod shaped translucent foreign bodies lodged in the superior tarsal conjunctiva.</p>
      <p>Normally, a conjunctival foreign body initially causes, an acute inflammatory response involving exudation of plasma and fibrin. This normally dislodges the foreign body. However, in cases of a foreign body with a large surface area and sharp edges (similar to the examples presented here), this mechanism may be insufficient and the foreign body remains embedded. This is followed by a chronic inflammatory response resulting in the formation of a granuloma containing epithelial and foreign body giant cells.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p>
      <p>After examination of foreign bodies under high magnifications [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e</xref>e, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3e</xref>] and through research on the shape and type of material of the foreign bodies we identified it as glass wool. Glass wool is a type of insulating material made from fiberss of glass arranged into a texture similar to wool. It is commonly used as insulation for heating vents and air conditioning ducts in homes and buildings. Hence, it is very common in the surrounding environment and can enter the eye. Glass wool may also irritate the skin and respiratory system.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Glass wool is inert in nature, hence it did not cause an inflammatory response.</p>
      <p>In all three cases reported above a meticulous clinical examination using slit lamp biomicroscopy as well as ancillary investigations such as fluorescein staining and visualization with cobalt blue filter established the presence of translucent tripod foreign bodies lodged in the upper palpebral conjunctiva.</p>
