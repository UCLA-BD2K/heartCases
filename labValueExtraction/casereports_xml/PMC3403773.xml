      <abstract>
        <p>Spinal tuberculosis or Pott's disease of the spine associated with pleural involvement has long intrigued researchers regarding the nature and pathogenesis of their occurrence. We describe two interesting patients of spinal tuberculosis, one with cervical and another with thoracic spine disease, with pleural involvement, which developed after lateral extension of cold abscess involving the parietal pleura, and without any evidence of pulmonary disease.</p>

  <body>
    <p>We present two interesting patients with tuberculous lesions of two different parts of the spine in whom magnetic resonance imaging revealed unusual pleural involvement. In both cases, the diagnosis of tuberculosis was confirmed by demonstration of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> in the paraspinal collection aspirated under computed tomography guidance. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>

    <p>Spinal tuberculosis or Pott's disease of the spine associated with pleural involvement has for long intrigued the researchers regarding the nature and pathogenesis of their occurrence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> Pleural effusion secondary to large extra-pleural extension of paravertebral abscess has been described in a series published in 1955. The author suggested that pleural involvement occurred either before or after the development of the spinal lesion, but rarely without pulmonary disease or without operative interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> Our two patients represent a rare occurrence of pleural involvement, which developed concomitantly with lateral extension of cold abscess involving the parietal pleura but without any evidence of pulmonary disease.</p>
