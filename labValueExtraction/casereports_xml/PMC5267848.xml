      <p>Choriocarcinoma vulva is an exceptional location of gestational trophoblastic tumors. We report the case of a female patient of 23 years who had vulvar mass, painful, sitting at the large right lip and measured five centimeters in diameter. Pelvic ultrasound was normal. Beta-h-CG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) quantitative plasma were highly increased. The staging. The biopsy of the mass objectified choriocarcinoma of vulvar. A methotrexate-based agent chemotherapy was introduced. The outcome was favorable. With a decline of 24 months, no recurrence was noted. Choriocarcinoma vulva is a clinical form of trophoblastic tumors which one must think before all lesions with positive plasma beta-h-CG, especially in a woman of childbearing age and the waning of a pregnancy event. A patient aged 23 presented with a history spontaneous miscarriage which occurred five months earlier consulted for vulvar mass, painful, which gradually increased in size. On examination, the mass was sitting at the large right lip, it was inflammatory, firm and tender to palpation and measured five centimeters in diameter. Pelvic ultrasound was normal. Beta-h-CG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) quantitative plasma were highly increased to 562 000 IU / ml. The staging featuring a thoraco-abdomino pelvic CT scan, chest X-ray and ultrasound abdomen and pelvis was normal. The biopsy of the mass objectified choriocarcinoma of vulvar. A methotrexate-based agent chemotherapy was introduced. The evolution was marked by the gradual decline of the mass until it disappears in four months. Plasma beta-h-CG had regressed and were normalized after three months of treatment. The outcome was favorable. With a decline of 24 months, no recurrence was noted.</p>
