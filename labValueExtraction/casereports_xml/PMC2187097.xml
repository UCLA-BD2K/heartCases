      <abstract>
        <p>Lymphocytes from a patient who had an unusually long survival after therapy for a human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus (HTLV)-associated T cell lymphoma were stimulated in vitro with an autologous tumor cell line, and the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) was studied. CTL generated were directed against autologous (HTLV-associated tumor cells. These propagated CTL were OKT3+, OKT4-, and OKT8+. The cytotoxic activity required target tumor cells that were infected with HTLV and also expressed histocompatibility antigens in common with the patient, suggesting a major histocompatibility complex-restricted associative recognition of target antigens expressed on the tumor cell membrane.</p>
