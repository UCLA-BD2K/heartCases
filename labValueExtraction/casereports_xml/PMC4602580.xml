      <p><italic>Cryptococcus</italic> spp is a kind of saprophytic yeast usually found in soil, dust, manure, and litter made from bark or leaves from various trees.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><italic>Cryptococcus</italic> spp had been reported to be responsible for infection in several animal species and caused a wide range of diseases such as meningoencephalitis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, abscesses in various internal organs, and ocular disorders.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In human beings, <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> most commonly presented with meningitis, and the incidence ranges from 2% to 9%.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In recent decades, the incidence was rising due to the increasing numbers of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Ophthalmic infections can occur by direct extension along the subarachnoid space of the optic nerve or by hematogenous dissemination.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The ocular presentations can manifest as papilledema, optic atrophy, extraocular muscle paresis, chorioretinitis, and endophthalmitis;<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> however, the corneal involvement was rare. Here we report an unusual case of <italic>Cryptococcus albidus</italic> keratitis that was early diagnosed by dot hybridization assay and successfully treated by intrastromal injection of Amphotericin B (AB).</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 45-year-old man without any ophthalmic or systemic diseases came to our clinic due to pain and redness (OS) for 2 days. He was a farmer and was hit by a plant accidentally while working. The initial best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of left eye was 20/400, and the intraocular pressure (OS) was 16&#x200A;mm Hg. Slit lamp examination revealed corneal infiltrations with satellite lesions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A), the conjunctiva was injected, the cornea was edema, and severe anterior chamber reaction was noted. The posterior segment examinations including fundoscopy, and ultrasound were normal. Thus, under the diagnosis of corneal ulcer, he received corneal scrapping for Gram stain and acid-fast stain. Aerobic, fungus, and mycobacterium cultures were performed for infection etiology survey. Due to his occupation and contact history, he was treated as fungal keratitis (FK). Topical antifungal agents, including natamycin and fortified AB (2&#x200A;mg/mL), were applied hourly.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>However, the clinical condition worsened in the following days. Not only the size and depth of corneal infiltrations increased, but also endothelium plaques and anterior chamber hypopyon were noted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). Gram-stain, acid-fast stain, aerobic, mycobacterium, and fungus culture results were all negative. Therefore, we repeated the smears and cultures again; meanwhile, aqueous humor polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for pathogen identification was also performed. The PCR was done with dot hybridization method described before,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> which revealed <italic>C albidus</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). We then shifted the medication to topical AB and fluconazole, and prescribed oral fluconazole. Unfortunately, newly formed satellite infiltration was found after adjusting the medication; therefore, we performed intrastromal injection of AB (100&#x200A;&#x3BC;g/0.1&#x200A;mL) around the corneal lesion site.</p>

      <p>A preparation of AB (50-mg powder, Fungizone; Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, New York City, NY) for intravenous administration was initially diluted in sterile distilled water to obtain a 0.5% concentration. The preparation was then mixed with balanced salt solution (BSS; Alcon, Fort Worth, TX) under sterile conditions and was diluted to a concentration of 100&#x200A;&#x3BC;g/0.1&#x200A;mL. Local anesthesia was established with proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5% (Alcaine<sup>;</sup> Alcon). Under aseptic conditions, AB was injected into the corneal stroma using a 1-mL syringe with a 30-gauge needle according to the method described before.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In brief, the needle was bended, inserted obliquely, and beveled down from the uninvolved, clear area to reach the lesion site at the midstromal level. The procedure was performed under microscope without entering the anterior chamber, and multiple injections were administered in order to hydrate the corneal stroma and form barriers around the infiltrations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). Once the desired amount of hydration was achieved, the plunger was withdrawn slightly to ensure discontinuation of the capillary column and prevent leakage of the drug. The patient continued topical antifungal therapy after the instratromal injection; the corneal infiltration size and hypopyon gradually decreased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B).</p>

      <p><italic>C albidus</italic> is a species most frequently found in water and plants and is also found on animal and human skin.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Ophthalmic involvement by bloodborne pathway, such as chorioretinitis and endophthalmitis, were reported in systemic cryptococcosis.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, isolated corneal involvement of <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> is very rare. We searched PubMed and MEDLINE from 1950 to March 2015 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>); there were only 3 cases reported as <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> spp-related keratitis,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and only one was caused by <italic>C albidus</italic>.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>

      <p>Microbial keratitis is an important cause of monocular blindness worldwide.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Of the microbial keratitis cases &gt;50% are FK in some settings, especially in warm climates, areas affected by monsoons, and less urbanized regions.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Agriculture farmers are more commonly to have FK, and it may lead to poor outcomes if it was not diagnosed accurately and treated properly. The <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> spp belongs to a fungus group in microbiology; its corneal infection was easily overlooked or missed because of the low incidence rate, less acute course, and the lack of diagnostic tool at initial presentation. The usual smear and culture methods to identify microorganism have poor sensitivity in deep corneal infiltration. Currently, real-time PCR is the fastest method of the PCR-based techniques, but the method normally requires a sophisticated instrument and a well-trained medical staff.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Thus, in this case, we used dot hybridization assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The dot hybridization method based on oligonucleotide probes immobilized on synthetic membranes was found to be very sensitive and specific for identification of a wide spectrum of pure cultures of fungi and yeasts.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The assay we used in this case had been reported previously, which was based on the species-specific and genus-specific oligonucleotide probes (16 to 30&#x200A;mers).<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In addition, a probe designed from the <italic>5.8S rRNA</italic> gene was used as a positive control and a digoxigenin-labeled universal bacterial primer 6R was used as a position marker.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The dot hybridization method was proved to have high sensitivity and specificity for laboratory diagnosis of FK<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and can be completed in 16 to 24 hours, regardless of the infecting species.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> No additional time was required for mixed cultures. Conversely, identification for yeast species by conventional methods requires 1 week and takes 2 weeks or longer for molds.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Therefore, the dot hybridization assay provided timely and accurate diagnosis in this case.</p>
      <p>Despite the early diagnosis by dot hybridization assay, the treatment for deep corneal infection was very difficult. In previous reports, patients infected by <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> spp received therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty or even enucleation due to diffuse corneal involvement.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Since intrastromal injection of antifungal agents was effective in deep recalcitrant FK,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> we used instratromal injection of AB to treat our patient (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A), and the infiltration gradually improved (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). It should be noted that although our patient received fortified topical AB and fluconazole as part of the treatment, significant improvement was only noted after intrastromal injection of AB. The BCVA was 20/400 on the first day of the infection and improved to 20/200 one week after the treatment. Three months later, the BCVA improved to 20/40. Therefore, due to the improvement of BCVA, and the faint scar formation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B), we suggested that intrastromal injection for <italic>C albidus</italic> corneal ulcer is an effective treatment.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, to our knowledge, this is the first report of <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> keratitis early diagnosed by dot hybridization assay and successfully treated by intrastromal injection of AB. We suggest that in recalcitrant corneal infections, using diagnostic tool such as dot hybridization assay is a quick, sensitive, and specific method to identify the pathogen.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Additionally, intrastromal injections of therapeutic agents may offer a less invasive, in-office alternative to penetrating keratoplasty.</p>
