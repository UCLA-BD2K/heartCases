          <title>Background</title>
          <p>There are few data relating to sirolimus overdose in the medical literature. Our objectives were to describe all cases of overdose with sirolimus reported to Swiss, German and Austrian Poisons Centres between 2002-2013.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec002">
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>An observational case-series analysis was performed to determine circumstances, magnitude, management and outcome of sirolimus overdose.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec003">
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Five cases of acute sirolimus overdose were reported &#x2013; three in young children and two in adults. Four were accidental and one was with suicidal intent. Two patients developed symptoms probably related to sirolimus overdose: mild elevation of alkaline phosphatase, fever and gastroenteritis in a 2.5-year-old male who ingested 3 mg, and mild changes in total cholesterol in an 18-year-old female after ingestion of 103 mg. None of these events were life-threatening. Serial blood concentration measurements were performed starting 24 h after ingestion of 103 mg in a single case, and these followed a similar pharmacokinetic time-course to measurements taken after dosing in the therapeutic range.</p>

        <sec id="sec004">
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Acute sirolimus overdose occurred accidentally in the majority of cases. Even large overdoses appeared to be well-tolerated, however children might be at greater risk of developing complications. Further study of sirolimus overdose is needed.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Sirolimus (formerly rapamycin) is an immunosuppressive agent licensed for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in renal transplant recipients [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is recommended that sirolimus be used initially in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids, with subsequent withdrawal of cyclosporine as necessary [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is also used off-label in other types of organ transplant. Sirolimus inhibits activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes and antibody production by a distinct mechanism. In cells, it binds to the immunophilin, FK Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12). The resulting complex in turn inhibits the activation of a key regulatory kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Failure to activate mTOR results in inhibition of Interleukin-2-driven T-cell proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>Sirolimus is a cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein substrate, making it susceptible to interactions with drugs that induce or inhibit the activity of these drug-handling proteins [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The maximum licensed starting dose of oral sirolimus in combination with cyclosporine (a cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitor) for adults and children over 13 years in Switzerland is 6 mg/day [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Absorption and metabolism of sirolimus is highly variable [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and this results in great differences in blood concentrations between patients who have received the same dose. Subsequent dosing is therefore guided according to trough whole blood concentrations. A target trough concentration range of 5&#x2013;15 &#x3BC;g/L when sirolimus is used concomitantly with cyclosporine and prednisone has been shown to be associated with effective rejection prophylaxis with minimal concentration-dependent adverse effects (leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hypertriglyceridemia) [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the absence of cyclosporine, a four-fold increase in dose is usually required, however it is recommended that the daily dose should not exceed 40 mg [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Hypercholesterolaemia is a commonly reported adverse effect of sirolimus [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], however it appears to be only weakly dose-related [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>Patients taking sirolimus or their household contacts who could have access to their drugs may be exposed to overdose, however, little is known about the effects of sirolimus in acute overdose. Sirolimus has a long half-life (62 &#xB1; 12 h in a study of renal transplant patients receiving concomitant cyclosporine and prednisone [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]), therfore a single overdose may have a prolonged effect. One source briefly mentions two cases of overdose with sirolimus [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the first case, ingestion of 120 mg sirolimus was well tolerated, and in the second case atrial fibrillation developed after ingestion of 150 mg. A dose-escalation study in renal transplant patients taking cyclosporine examined the effect of single doses up to 15 mg/m<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128033.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The only safety issues which arose were a case of transient thrombocytopenia (probably related to the single 28 mg sirolimus dose) and a case of mild epistaxis (possibly related to the single 21 mg sirolimus dose). A further study administered single doses of 21 mg/m<sup>2</sup> to three stable renal transplant patients receiving cyclosporine [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], none of whom experienced toxicity. All this information relates to adults. There are no reports in the literature of sirolimus overdose during the post-marketing period.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the circumstances, management and outcomes of overdoses with sirolimus in adults and children using data reported to Swiss, German, and Austrian poisons centres.</p>

      <sec id="sec007">
        <title>Study design and inclusion criteria</title>
        <p>A specific ethics approval was not required for this observational study due to the nature of the study design according to the regulations of the cantonal ethics committee Zurich, Switzerland at the time when the study was performed which also stated that anonymised data generated during patient care can be used retrospectively for research purposes without obtaining written consent. The clinical toxicologist who first advised on a case assigned it an internal unique case identifier. Once all data pertaining to the case (including follow up) had been obtained, the case was closed and the data&#x2014;excluding patient-identifying information&#x2014;was exported to a research database. This research database to which the authors had access therefore did not contain any patient-identifying information.</p>
        <p>We performed a multicentre retrospective review of all acute overdoses involving sirolimus in adults and children (&lt;16 years) either alone or in combination with other drugs that have been reported anonymously according to the Codex of the Society of Clinical Toxicology (GfKT) [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] to Swiss (Zurich), German (Berlin, Bonn, Erfurt, Freiburg, G&#xF6;ttingen, Mainz, Munich) and Austrian (Vienna) poisons centres between January 2002 and December 2013. The data, entered by physicians, included age, sex, weight, ingested drug and dose, symptoms/signs/laboratory values and causal relationship, severity of intoxication, decontamination measures, latency to decontamination, and therapeutic interventions.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec008">
        <title>Circumstances and symptoms of overdose</title>
        <p>The circumstances of overdose were categorised as `suicidal`for cases of intentional overdose, `domestic`for cases of accidental overdose in the home (primarily in children) and `iatrogenic`for those due to a prescribing or administration error in hospital.</p>
        <p>The severity of symptoms were graded in accordance with the Poisoning Severity Score (PSS) as &#x2018;minor&#x2019;, for mild, transient and spontaneously resolving symptoms/signs; &#x2018;moderate&#x2019;, if at least one pronounced or prolonged symptom/sign was recorded; &#x2018;severe&#x2019;, if at least one severe or life-threatening symptom/sign was observed, or `fatal`, if the overdose was the recorded cause of death [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
        <p>Cases were assessed for association between symptoms or signs and the immunosuppressant overdose by an expert panel including a senior clinical pharmacologist and a senior clinical toxicologist, both with additional qualifications in general internal medicine, using the World Health Organisation Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) standardised case causality assessment criteria originally developed for the assessment of adverse drug reactions [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Comorbidities, co-ingestion of other medication (in patients with multiple drug overdose or taking other drugs in the therapeutic dose range) and the magnitude of overdose were taken into consideration. Associations were classified as `certain`, `likely`, `possible`and `unlikely`(Table A in <xref rid="pone.0128033.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec009">
        <title>Statistical analyses</title>
        <p>Overdoses in mg/kg were compared with usual therapeutic doses by determining the multiple of the subject`s usual therapeutic dose (dose received/usual dose) as performed in our previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Sirolimus is not licensed for children under the age of 13 years, so no calculation of the extent of overdose could be made. Missing data regarding patient weight was computed as detailed in Section A of the <xref rid="pone.0128033.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>.</p>

        <title>Pharmacokinetic calculations</title>
        <p>Half-life, clearance/bioavailability and apparent volume of distribution were calculated according to the standard pharmacokinetic equations given in Section A of the <xref rid="pone.0128033.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref> and PKSolver for Microsoft Excel was used for graphic representation [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>

      <p>There were a total of 367,445 reports to the Swiss Toxicological Information Centre of confirmed or suspected overdose with any substance by healthcare professionals during the study period. Of these, three were with sirolimus (<xref rid="pone.0128033.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> patients 1&#x2013;3). Two cases were reported to German poisons centres during the same time period (<xref rid="pone.0128033.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> patients 4 and 5). There were no reports to the Austrian poisons centre.</p>

The concentration-time profile is shown in <xref rid="pone.0128033.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>. The patient did not receive sirolimus again until at least 20 days after the overdose.

        <p>Two sirolimus overdoses were judged to have caused or contributed to symptoms or abnormal clinical findings (<xref rid="pone.0128033.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Patient 1 developed one minor and two moderate symptoms (increased liver enzymes, fever and gastroenteritis) two days after the event. Patient 3 complained of tiredness and showed a spontaneous decline in total cholesterol levels several days after overdose which implied that overdose was associated with an elevation in total cholesterol (<xref rid="pone.0128033.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Triglyceride concentrations were not above the normal range and did not change significantly from day 4 to day 67 post-overdose (data not shown).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this observational case-series analysis of sirolimus overdoses reported to poisons centres within Germany, Austria and Switzerland between 2002 and 2013, we found that acute overdoses appear to be generally well tolerated, with no life-threatening events observed.</p>
      <sec id="sec019">
        <title>Circumstances and magnitude of overdose</title>
        <p>In this series, three of the five overdoses occurred accidentally in children at home and one iatrogenically in the hospital setting. The latter case involved a liquid formulation, which we have observed to be associated with drug-errors involving other immunosuppressants [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, 80% of the overdoses could have been prevented. Doctors who prescribe and pharmacists who dispense sirolimus should therefore be extra vigilant when dealing with unusual formulations and/or administration routes and patients who live with young children. Perhaps repeated instruction to keep medicines out of children&#x2019;s`reach is required and not just when sirolimus is dispensed for the first time. Due to the fact that absorption and metabolism of sirolimus is so varied between patients, different patients require different doses to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. An overdose was therefore considered to have taken place when this dose was exceeded, and is the reason why we report the multiple of the subject`s usual therapeutic dose in the two patients who were being treated with sirolimus.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec020">
        <title>Management</title>
        <p>On the basis of its chemical properties, a good adsorption of sirolimus onto activated charcoal is to be expected. Sirolimus has a molecular weight of 914.17 Dalton, which means that it is expected to be readily adsorbed into the 10&#x2013;1000 &#xC5;-sized charcoal pores of current activated charcoal products [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Treatment with activated charcoal in cases presenting to health care services within two hours of overdose therefore seems reasonable.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec021">
        <title>Signs and symptoms</title>
        <p>In one case, elevated alkaline phosphatase, fever and gastroenteritis occurred two days after overdose, and in another total serum cholesterol levels reduced steadily after overdose, the latter implying a concentration-dependent effect of sirolimus as found in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Dyslipidaemia is a well-known dose-dependent adverse effect of mTOR inhibitors that is thought to occur through down-regulation of low-density lipoprotein receptors and inhibition of lipoprotein lipase activity [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Elevated triglyceride concentrations are known to be more strongly dose-related than cholesterol concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and may have been present early after overdose in patient 3, however no measurements were performed during this time so it is not possible to comment.</p>
        <p>It could be speculated that the high serum concentration and long half-life of sirolimus led to significant immunosuppression in patient 1 (a young child) which increased his susceptibility to intercurrent infection.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec022">
        <title>Pharmacokinetic profile</title>
        <p>Twenty-four hours after taking 103 mg of sirolimus, patient 3`s sirolimus blood concentration was 127.6 &#x3BC;g/L. By way of comparison, 6 healthy, male, adult volunteers had a mean maximum sirolimus concentration (Cmax) of 47.6 &#x3BC;g/L after intake of a single 5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> dose (approximately 9 mg for an average-sized man) [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
        <p>Several pharmacokinetic studies of sirolimus have shown it to fit a two-compartment model, as we also saw in patient 3 [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128033.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A pharmacokinetic study of single-dose sirolimus in 16 stable renal transplant recipients (receiving concomitant cyclosporine and prednisone) found a range of half-lives from 39.3 to 86.5 h (compare 51.6 h in patient 3 in the present study) and an 8-fold difference in apparent clearance (0.042 to 0.339 L/h/kg) [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The calculated apparent first compartment clearance found in patient 3 of 0.139 L/h/kg falls within this range (<xref rid="pone.0128033.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The apparent volume of distribution for the first (`central`) compartment (0.9 L/kg) is in keeping with sirolimus`protein binding and distribution in blood cells [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and was also in the range reported by Wu and colleagues in a population pharmacokinetics study (53.4 L) [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although it is not possible to draw conclusions from a single case, the pharmacokinetics of sirolimus in overdose appear to be similar to what is seen in the therapeutic dose range.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec023">
        <title>Limitations</title>
        <p>Our study has a number of limitations, primarily related to the small sample size. Larger series of sirolimus overdoses have, however, not been published. It is likely that our data did not capture all cases of overdose which occurred in the referral population. Our data are also incomplete, which is the nature of retrospective studies using poison centre data [<xref rid="pone.0128033.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and in one case (patient 5), concomitant cyclosporine intake was assumed. A further limitation is the paucity of data regarding whole blood concentration measurements.</p>
        <p>Sirolimus overdose patterns, management and outcomes require further study and clinical toxicologists, nephrologists and treating physicians should be encouraged to actively seek follow-up data on the cases with which they are involved. Further preventive measures are required to reduce the frequency of iatrogenic errors involving liquid formulations and accidental poisoning of children in the home.</p>
