      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has changed dramatically in recent years due to the development of many new drugs including direct-acting antiviral and host-targeted agents.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Interferon (IFN)-free regimens for treatment of different HCV genotypes could achieve high rates of sustained virologic response without the side effect of IFN. However, the cost of these new drugs is very high.

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>This is a 53-year-old male patient who went to our hospital with chief complaint of massive gum bleeding for 1 day. The patient had a history of chronic hepatitis C. PEG-IFN-&#x3B1;-2a (180&#x200A;&#x3BC;g) plus ribavirin (1200&#x200A;mg/day) were prescribed to the patient since March 17, 2014. He denied any autoimmune conditions before treatment. The baseline virological data revealed high virus load (HCV RNA 2.1&#x200A;&#xD7;&#x200A;10<sup>6</sup>&#x200A;IU/mL) with genotype 1b. Rapid virological response was not achieved at the fourth week (HCV RNA: 2.12&#x200A;&#xD7;&#x200A;10<sup>6</sup>&#x200A;IU/mL). Partial early virological response (HCV RNA: 103&#x200A;IU/mL at week 12) and delayed virological response (HCV RNA: &lt;15&#x200A;IU/mL at Week 24) were noted. However, fatigue, anemia, and depression syndrome were progressed at 30<sup>th</sup> week. The patient requested to stop treatment at Week 36. The viral load at the end-of-treatment (EOT) was undetectable. The platelet count at EOT was 92&#x200A;&#xD7;&#x200A;10<sup>3</sup>&#x200A;cells/&#x3BC;L and elevated to 159&#x200A;&#xD7;&#x200A;10<sup>3</sup>&#x200A;cells/&#x3BC;L 1 week later.</p>
      <p>Two weeks following EOT, the patient developed massive gum bleeding. The physical examination showed the multiple petechiae on the extremities. There is no sign of intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, or other internal bleeding. The initial platelet count was 4&#x200A;&#xD7;&#x200A;10<sup>3</sup>cells/&#x3BC;L. Coagulation profile showed normal prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, <sc>d</sc>-dimer, and fibrin degradation product. Peripheral blood smear showed neither fragmented red blood cells, helmet cells nor abnormal platelet aggregation. Concomitant autoimmune connective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or cryoglobulinemia were excluded due to negative anti-nuclear antibody and cryoglobulin except for positive anti-cardiolipin IgG (116 GPL, normal range &lt;20 GPL) and anti-phospholipid IgG (165&#x200A;U, normal range &lt;15&#x200A;U). Anti-phospholipid syndrome was excluded due to no previous thromboembolic events, according to 2006 Sapporo criteria.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Bone marrow biopsy was also performed, which revealed hypocellular marrow with even cellular distribution and without evidence of lymphoid neoplasia. The potential drugs that may cause platelet lysis were ruled out. Blood transfusion of platelet was performed, but poor response with rapid decline of platelet count in the next day of transfusion. A diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenic purpura was made.</p>
      <p>We started intravenous methylprednisolone therapy (40&#x200A;mg, 3 times daily) on November 27 combined with platelet transfusion treatments. It still showed no significant improvement. Azathioprine (100&#x200A;mg, oral, once daily) was added since December 3. Hydroxychloroquine (400&#x200A;mg, oral, once daily) was also prescribed due to positive anti-phospholipid antibodies. Platelet count gradually increased to 93&#x200A;&#xD7;&#x200A;10<sup>3</sup>&#x200A;cells/&#x3BC;L 17 days after admission, so methylprednisolone was changed to oral form and slowly tapered off. On December 15, the patient was discharged due to stable condition with platelet counts elevating to 117&#x200A;&#xD7;&#x200A;10<sup>3</sup>&#x200A;cells/&#x3BC;L (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Followed laboratory data after 5 months revealed sustained virologic response, platelet count above 150&#x200A;&#xD7;&#x200A;10<sup>3</sup>&#x200A;cells/&#x3BC;L, and decreased anti-cardiolipin IgG (30.5GPL) and anti-phospholipid IgG (73.21&#x200A;U) levels.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>ITP is a rare complication following chronic hepatitis C infection treatment with PEG-IFN-&#x3B1; therapy plus ribavirin, probably due to immune modulatory effect of IFN.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> It can be seen at any time during IFN therapy, from the 4th week to the 12th month,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> or even 6 months after the completion of therapy.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> It can follow a course of gradual or sudden decline in platelet count. In the present case, platelet count raised to normal range 1 week after EOT. Severe thrombocytopenia developed 2 weeks later and was proved to be ITP by cautiously excluding other possible causes of thrombocytopenia. The delayed immune modulatory effects may be partially due to longer half-life and prolonged activity of pegylated form of IFN. The physicians must be aware that ITP can occur even after the end of treatment, as a late onset complication, especially when using the pegylated forms of IFN.</p>
      <p>ITP was known to be mediated by autoantibodies, which bind to several platelet-surface glycoproteins and promote platelet clearance through Fc&#x3B3;receptors that are expressed by tissue macrophages.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Neoantigens generated from degraded platelets further initiated CD4-positive T-cell clones, resulting in sufficient antibody production to cause thrombocytopenia. IFN can promote the differentiation of macrophages, and the production of interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-&#x3B1;, which may enhance the efficiency of antigen presentation of macrophage.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> PEG-IFN alone or combined with ribavirin also induces strength of CD4+ T-cell responses.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> This phenomenon may partially explain the mechanism of IFN-induced ITP.</p>
      <p>ITP may be related to the HCV infection. The practice guideline for HCV-related ITP treatment suggested that anti-viral therapy combined with intravenous immunoglobulin was the initial treatment instead of steroid, in concerning of the possibility of HCV reactivation after steroid treatment.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> However in our case, at the end of IFN treatment, the viral load was undetectable. The HCV-related ITP was excluded.</p>
      <p>In the literature, there were three case reports describing late-onset ITP associated with IFN treatment (one was written in Serbian) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The patients&#x2019; age ranges from 27 to 37 years&#x2019; old without significant difference in sex, and are all treated with pegylated form of IFN. After completion of IFN treatment course, the ITP occurred immediately or delayed up to 6 months. Though none of the patient had preexisting autoimmune disease, anti-platelet antibodies were detected in one of them, suggesting an autoimmune-mediated reaction even after discontinuation of the IFN therapy. This phenomenon was also found in our case presenting as elevated anti-phospholipid antibodies. In concerning of HCV reactivation, 2 reports avoid using steroid for ITP treatment. However, there was no remarkable difference in prognosis compared with the other report, as platelet counts all normalized to baseline after treatment without HCV flaring up. Due to limited case number, we could not conclude any risk factor to predict late-onset type of ITP. The physicians&#x2019; awareness of late-onset ITP after completion of IFN treatment may favor prompt disease control and good outcome.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="medi-94-e1296-g002"/>
      </table-wrap>
      <p>There was no consensus in management of IFN -induced ITP, or even late-onset ITP associated with IFN treatment. Immediate withdrawal of IFN therapy and treatment with immunosuppressants were administered in previous reports.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In our case, we initially gave high-dose methylprednisolone therapy without intravenous immunoglobulin in concerning of financial reason and the evidence of undetectable viral load at the end of treatment. Though poor response was revealed in the first week, the treatment response was noted 12 days after methylprednisolone treatment. A previous report showed the treatment response of prednisolone for ITP initiates in 4 to 14 days and peaks in 7 to 28 days.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive agent recommended as one of second-line drugs for ITP. The treatment response of azathioprine starts in 30 to 90 days and peaks in 30 to 180 days.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Hence, the treatment response of this case may be related to the effect of methylprednisolone.</p>
      <p>From the previous reports of IFN-related ITP, platelet count may rapidly improve within 1-week treatment of steroid pulse therapy plus intravenous immunoglobulin treatment following cessation of IFN therapy,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> or being refractory until second-line therapy such as anti-RhD or rituximab treatment for 16 months.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> No mortality occurred in all cases. It indicated that, despite different and individual response to treatment, ITP after IFN seemed to perform an optimistic prognosis upon prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment, as well as late-onset type.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p>
      <p>High serum level of anti-cardiolipin antibodies (ACA) and anti-phospholipid antibodies without anti-b2- glycoprotein-I antibodies was detected in our case. Chronic hepatitis C infection has been associated with higher detection rate of ACA, especially following IFN-&#x3B1; treatment.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> However, previous studies do not support the hypothesis that HCV plays a specific role in the production of ACA and even the pathogenesis of anti-phospholipid syndrome.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> ACA production seems to be a nonspecific, transient phenomenon of liver damage, characterized by low titer and absence of associated anti-b2- glycoprotein-I.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Though anti-phospholipid antibodies were associated with thromboembolic events,<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> hydroxychloroquine had the protective effect against thrombosis in patients with positive anti-phospholipid antibodies.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> In our case, we used hydroxychloroquine for primary prevention. No clinical or laboratory evidence of thromboembolic events occurred despite the high positive titer of ACA, which gradually decreased during following up. This epiphenomenon may not be clinically meaningful.</p>

      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>In conclusion, ITP is a rare but life-threatening complication following PEG-IFN-&#x3B1; treatment for chronic hepatitis C patients. It could occur at any time following IFN treatment and even after withdrawal of treatment. Physicians should be aware of this late-onset complication after PEG-IFN treatment.</p>
