        <p>In this article, three cases of hereditary angioedema (HAE) type III
(estrogen-dependent or with normal C1 inhibitor) are reported. The HAE was initially
described in women of the same family in association with high-leveled estrogenic
conditions such as the use of oral contraceptives and pregnancy. There is no change
in the C1 inhibitor as happens in other types of hereditary angioedema, and mutations
are observed in the encoding gene of the XII factor of coagulation in several
patients. The current diagnosis is mainly clinical and treatment consists in the
suspension of the triggering factors and control of acute symptoms. A brief review of
physiopathology, clinical features, genetic alterations and treatment are also
presented.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by recurrent
episodes of swelling of the skin and / or mucous, which can also affect the
gastrointestinal tract and upper airways in a severe way. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B01">1</xref></sup>The crisis does not respond to antihistamines,
corticosteroids or adrenaline and usually disappear spontaneously within 12-72 hours.
There is a mutation in the gene that encodes the C1 inhibitor of the complement factor
(INHC1), inducing a reduction in its synthesis (type I HAE) or the formation of a
dysfunctional protein (type II HAE). In 2000, a new subtype of HAE was described, which
is clinically indistinguishable from the others, predominantly in women, in which the
INHC1 is normal. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B02">2</xref></sup>The new disorder was
called hereditary angioedema type III, estrogen-dependent hereditary angioedema or
hereditary angioedema with normal C1 activity (type III HAE). There is a verifiable
association with this type of hereditary angioedema and situations where increased
levels of estrogen occur such as the use of oral contraceptives and pregnancy, which are
recognised crises factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B02">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B04">4</xref></sup>The objective of this article is to
describe the clinical and laboratory findings of three cases of this new type of HAE as
well as briefly reviewing existing literature on the physiopathology, clinical features,
genetic alterations, diagnosis and treatment.</p>

      <title>REPORT OF THE CASES</title>
      <p>1. Female patient, 35 years old, married, doctor, reported crisis of intense facial
swelling for nine years, always attacking the lips. At the beginning the crisis were
light and sporadic, but over time the crises were more intense, occurring at approximate
two month intervals with a duration of at least two days. The crisis incapacitated the
patient from her socio-labor activities due to alteration in facial esthetics. Abdominal
pain or respiratory alterations were never symptoms during the attacks. She reported
having initiated the use of oral contraceptives for about nine years with no pause. She
never got pregnant. There was no known history of angioedema in her family. The crises
were not associated with the intake of any medication. The initial diagnostic hypotheses
were made of common angioedema and hereditary angioedema (HAE). During the
investigation, an idiopathic thrombocitosis was discovered and started being monitored
along with a hematologist. The general tests, except for an increase in platelet levels,
were normal, as were the C4, C1q and C1 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ch01">Chart 1</xref>). The inhibitor had been asked previously and always appeared normal.
It was requested a discontinuation of oral contraceptives for possibly dealing with a
case of HAE type III but also by thrombocitosis. After stopping the medication, the
patient had no more angioedema crisis. She has been monitored for three years.</p>

      <p>2. Female patient, 35 years, single, biomedical researcher, with a 12 years history of
recurrent episodes of severe edema on the upper lip and face. Initially the attacks
occurred twice a year however last year these became more serious, occurred fortnightly
and with a duration of 4 to 5 days, including once requiring hospitalization in the
Intensive Therapy Unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">2</xref>). The patient related the crisis to emotional
stress and also reported a worsening of symptoms during menstruation. She also never
became pregnant. The patient had been taking oral contraceptives for 12 years, but never
associated it with the crisis of angioedema. She had previously used a large number of
antihistamines, corticosteroids and adrenaline, without improvement. Her mother had
similar episodes of angioedema for 28 years, but in the last eight years she did not
have more attacks. Diagnostic hypotheses of common and hereditary angioedema were made
and tests were requested for the diagnosis, during the inter-crisis and crisis period
(<xref ref-type="table" rid="ch01">Chart 1</xref>).</p>

      <p>Since there was no change in the INHC1, it was thought to be a possible case of type III
HAE, resulting in the suspension of the oral contraceptive. The patient has subsequently
been free of attacks, a period of 30 months.</p>
      <p>3. Female patient, 26 years, single, student, with a history of the appearance two years
ago of recurrent swellings on her face and in various other locations on her body. She
reported that the crisis were initially sparse however last year the frequency
increased, occurring once or twice a month and preventing her normal activities. During
these two years she had intense abdominal pain twice, along with facial swelling. The
crisis did not respond to therapy with antihistamines and / or corticosteroids. She had
used oral contraceptives for 10 years, and eventually other drugs, which she did not
relate to episodes of facial swelling. The patient never fell pregnant. There was no
family history of angioedema. The initial diagnostic hypotheses were made of common
angioedema and hereditary angioedema. The examinations were normal between and during
the crisis, including C1 and C4 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ch01">Chart
1</xref>). Since there was no change in the inhibitor, the possibility of hereditary
angioedema type III was considered. We opted for the suspension of oral contraceptives
and she experienced no further attacks, being monitored for 21 months.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION AND LITERATURE REVIEW</title>
      <p>Angioedema is clinically characterized by sudden swelling of the skin and / or mucous,
including respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, with limited duration of 2 to 3 days,
not itchy, but with pain and variable burning sensations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B01">1</xref></sup>In many patients, it is associated with crisis of
urticaria, taking part in this case of the clinical picture on the same disease.
However, if the angioedema occurs alone, it's classified as a separate entity and is
called angioedema without wheals, which may be acquired or hereditary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B01">1</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare dominant Mendelian gene inheritance, affecting
approximately 1:50,000 people. 1 It is currently classified into three types (I, II and
III), according to the deficiency or absence of C1 inhibitor (INHC1). In the first two
types there is INHC1 deficiency, quantitative in HAE type I and qualitative in type II.
In the type III the deficiency of INHC1 does not occur.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B02">2</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The INHC1 is a regulatory protease of the classical pathway of the complement system
whose function is to inhibit the proteolytic activation of C2 and C4, coagulation factor
XII (Hagemann factor) and the production of kallikrein, plasmin and bradykinin.
Deficiency in INHC1 causes uncontrolled inflammation consequent to the overproduction
and accumulation of bradykinin, the major mediator of angioedema.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B03">3</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The crises of HAE can be triggered by trauma, pressure, emotional stress and the use of
medications, especially inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and estrogens,
which may induce and / or exacerbate quiescent disease in all types of HAE. 3 The crises
of HAE are uncomfortable for the patient, but doesn't offer risk of death, except when
they involve the airways, which could result in asphyxiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B03">3</xref></sup>All three types of HAE have the same incidence of asphyxia
and death.</p>
      <p>Many patients also present bowel wall edema during the crises, which clinically results
in episodes of severe and debilitating abdominal pain, sometimes the only symptom of
HAE. Vomiting and alteration of the intestinal pace may also be exhibited, symptoms
which often mimic an acute abdomen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B03">3</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In relation to pregnancy, patients with HAE usually improve, especially from the second
quarter. The trauma of delivery does not precipitate the crisis, but these may recur
after the first week of the puerperium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B03">3</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The HAE type III was first reported in 2000 by Bork et al, affecting women without
qualitative or quantitative INHC1 alteration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B02">2</xref></sup>The crises are related to the use of estrogen and during pregnancy.
In this article, we described three cases of patients with hereditary angioedema type
III. All of them had a clinical feature of angioedema without wheals, with frequent
disabling episodes affecting their social and laborative lives, involving mainly the
face. Dosages of INHC1 and C4 were normal between and during the crisis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ch01">Chart 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>It is known that estrogen has a role not yet fully understood in the crisis of HAE type
III. In many cases, the estrogen initiated and / or exacerbated the crisis of
angioedema, as with the patients described in this article.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B05">5</xref></sup>Binkley and Davis created the term estrogendependent after
observing angioedema conditions in women with high-leveled conditions of
estrogen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B06">6</xref></sup> They also proposed a
mutation in the androgen locus of the gene that encodes the INHC1. Elevated estrogen
levels are associated with increased levels of factor XII that, when activated, converts
prekallikrein to kallikrein, and consequently produces a greater amount of
bradykinin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B07">7</xref></sup>Besides this, high
levels of estrogen during pregnancy or with the use of oral contraceptives are
associated with a reduction of INHC1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B07">7</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The inheritance pattern of HAE type III has been the subject of numerous studies and a
source of discussion since the first reported cases. Initially, Bork et al suggested a
dominant inheritance X-linked, because all affected patients were female.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B04">4</xref></sup>Binkley and Davis reported an Italian
family with HAE type III that presented a dominant gene whose males were asymptomatic
carriers of the anomaly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B07">7</xref></sup>Bork et al also reported the occurrence of
the disease in a family in which three patients were male, suggesting a gene inheritance
indeed, but not necessarily X-linked.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B08">8</xref></sup>In this case, there could be another mutation, as is observed in other
types of HAE, without the existence of cases previously reported in the same family. In
2006 Dewald G et al and Cichon et al identified two mutations in the FXII gene (decoder
of the Hagemann factor) that would lead to a substitution of threonine to lysine
(Thr309Lys) and another that would replace the threonine to arginine
(Thr309Arg).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup>However, not all families of patients with HAE type III
would have these mutations. Besides these, several other mutations have been described
over the past year, indicating a genetic polymorphism that contributes to phenotypic
diversity of HAE type III.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref></sup></p>
      <p>There are reports of non-family cases, sporadic, that could present new genetic
mutations, different to those already described so far and still unknown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup>Of the three patients described in this
article, only one presented a known family history of angioedema (mother). Genetic tests
that could classify patients with a genetic alteration were not performed due to the
difficulty of such tests in our facilities.</p>
      <p>Recently, Bork proposed a new classification of HAE, according to the latest genetic
findings. According to this new classification, there were three types of HAE:</p>
      <p>(a) with a genetic deficiency of INHC1 (HAE types I and II);</p>
      <p>(b) with normal INHC1 (HAE type III) including those with two known mutations of the
gene factor XII (FXII-HAE) and those of unknown genetic cause (HAE-unknown).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B04">4</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The HAE attacks begin during childhood and worsen at puberty but can occur at any age.
The onset of symptoms in adulthood is significantly higher in patients with HAE type
III.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Symptoms of HAE type III are similar to other types of HAE: recurrent skin swelling,
abdominal pain attacks, swelling of the tongue and pharynx. There are no associated
wheals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup>The main clinical and
laboratorial differences with the HAE with INCH1 deficiency (types I and II) and normal
INCH1 (type III) are in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ch02">chart 2</xref>.</p>

      <p>Bork suggested that the face would be the site most affected in these patients,
especially the lips.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref></sup>It is observed
that the clinical manifestations of HAE type III are highly variable and it is believed
that the penetration of the disease is low, since there are reports of symptoms emerging
in seemingly asymptomatic female carriers of the genetic changes in the seventh decade
of their lives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup>In addition, there
are reports of symptomatic patients with normal and / or low levels of estrogens,
besides the manifestation of the disease in men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup></p>
      <p>All patients described in this article began the crises in adulthood, affecting mainly
the face, with lip swelling and eventually associated swelling of the tongue and larynx.
Patient 1 still had abdominal pain associated with skin condition.</p>
      <p>Laboratory tests are required for the diagnosis of HAE when there is a clinical
suspicion and / or family history of angioedema. The serum C4 and INHC1 dosages are
recommended (quantitative and qualitative). The C4 and INHC1 should also be evaluated in
crises when the results are normal. There is no indication of dosing CH50 or
C3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref></sup>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3</xref> shows the algorithm diagnosis of HAE. If
both the C4 and the quantitative INCH1 are low, then the diagnosis is compatible with
Type I HAE. If the C4 is below normal and the quantitative INCH1 is normal, it is
suggested the dosage of qualitative INHC1; if it's low, the diagnosis is compatible with
HAE type II. All tests should be repeated on another occasion to confirm the
diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref></sup>If both the C4 and
the quantitative INCH1 are normal, types I and II can be excluded and the hypothesis of
HAE type III should be considered. In this case, the repetition of the tests during the
angioedema crisis is always recommended.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref></sup></p>

      <p>In patients under 1 year old the laboratory tests are not reliable and should be
repeated with greater age, because it may cause false positive results and / or false
negative even when there are genetic alterations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The C4 and quantitative INHC1 dosages are routine examinations in large laboratories,
but the qualitative assessment of C1, in our environment, is performed only in a few
specialized laboratories.</p>
      <p>So far the diagnosis of HAE type III is conducted by clinical criteria, therefore there
are no laboratory tests to confirm it.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup>In cases of suspected genetic mutation with the HAE and FXII, the
diagnosis requires a confirmation of the mutation, reproducible only in research
centers. In our patients, the absence of laboratory parameters, coupled with the
clinical feature and immediate response to the removal of estrogen led to the
diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The treatment of HAE consists of the management of the attacks and long-term
prophylaxis. It is well recognized that corticosteroids, antihistamines and epinephrine
are not useful.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The therapeutic experience of this new type of HAE is limited because there are no
well-controlled studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Initially the use of estrogens (oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy)
must be suspended, as high levels of this hormone are related to angioedema crisis.</p>
      <p>In the acute phase, the following medications can be used: concentrated INCH1, fresh
frozen plasma, ecallantide and icatibant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In a study of seven patients with estrogendependent HAE who received concentrated dose
of INHC1 during the angioedema crisis, six reported moderate or significant improvement
of symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Fresh frozen plasma is effective in the acute phase of classical types of HAE. There is
a theoretical basis for using it also in HAE type III, especially if the use of
concentrated INCH1 is not possible. 10 However, there is no evidence in the literature
to justify its usage.</p>
      <p>The ecallantide is a potent and selective inhibitor of kallikrein which has been
recently used successfully in the crises of the classical HAE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref></sup>However, there are still no reports of its use for HAE
type III.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The icatibant, an antagonist of the bradykinin B2 receptor, has been shown to be
effective in the treatment of episodes of HAE, including the estrogendependent HAE, with
the resolution of symptoms within 2-3 hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Prophylactic therapy consists in the use of attenuated androgens, antifibrinolytic
agents and progesterone. The attenuated androgens are the most effective drugs and well
tolerated because they increase the levels of INHC1 and reduce the frequency of
crisis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B03">3</xref></sup>Danazol is the most
frequently used drug and can lead to remission of symptoms in patients with HAE-
FXII.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref></sup>Adverse effects such as
hepatotoxicity and virilization are uncommon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B03">3</xref></sup>Tranexamic acid is an antibrinolitic agent used for prophylaxis of
classical forms of HAE and acts preventing the activation of factor XII (by the
anti-plasmin action). Cicardi et al reported the effectiveness of tranexamic acid in
patients with idiopathic angioedema, in which many of these, by the clinical features,
would present undiagnosed HAE type III.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B09">9</xref></sup>There are reports of its successful use in a patient with
estrogen-dependent HAE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref></sup>Its use is
indicated in cases with persistent symptoms even after the suspension of
estrogen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup>Attention should be
paid to the higher incidence of thromboembolism during its use.</p>
      <p>Pregnant women represent a problem because androgens and antifibrinolytic agents are
contraindicated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B03">3</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Progesterone was used between 1 to 6 years in a study of eight patients with HAE FXII.
Seven of them taked progesterone in the form of oral contraceptive and one pacient taked
in the form of medroxyprogesterone injections. All remained attacks free during the
treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup></p>
      <p>To sum up, there are several treatment options aiming the control of crisis for patients
with HAE estrogen-dependent, but none confirmed with controlled studies. Most important,
as an initial measurement, is the suspension of exogenous estrogen (oral contraceptives
or hormone replacement therapy). Currently, during crises, the best treatment seems to
be the concentrated INCH1, not available in Brazil. 10</p>
      <p>The three patients described in this article showed a total improvement of the crisis
only with the suspension of oral contraceptives. They had previously used medications
such as antihistamines, corticosteroids and adrenaline, without success. Since the
condition remains in remission, it is not necessary to administer any prophylactic
drugs.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the HAE type III or estrogendependent disease is recent and rare, with a
diagnosis based on the clinical chart, family history and in many cases, association
with estrogen. The three cases reported in this article demonstrate it is a disease with
a relatively simple diagnosis and treatment, which often goes unnoticed in our daily
clinical practice. This disease when recognized and correctly diagnosed leads to
effective therapeutic measures instituting a vast improvement in the quality of life of
patients, since it is commonly understood that angioedema causes great social and
physical embarrassment.</p>
