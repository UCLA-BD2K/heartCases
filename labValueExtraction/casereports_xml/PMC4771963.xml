  <body>
    <p>Familial platelet disorder/acute myeloid leukemia (FPD/AML) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia and high propensity to various hematological malignancies. FPD/AML is caused by monoallelic mutations of <italic>RUNX1</italic>, which are in many cases point mutations disrupting DNA-binding or transactivating capacities of RUNX1, and these mutations are considered to act in dominant-negative manner to various degrees for residual wild-type allele.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Interestingly, some FPD/AML traits present monoallelic loss of <italic>RUNX1</italic> gene by microdeletion of chromosome 21.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> In such cases, no mutations were found in the residual <italic>RUNX1</italic> allele, thus suggesting that haploinsufficiency of <italic>RUNX1</italic> is sufficient to cause FPD/AML.</p>
    <p>Genetic basis of leukemic transformation in FPD/AML patients still remains elusive. We have recently reported recurrent mutation of <italic>CDC25C</italic> in FPD/AML patients, and suggested that this mutation is one of the early events, which defines pre-leukemic state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> However, all pedigrees that we examined carried point mutations of <italic>RUNX1</italic>, and no cases with monoallelic <italic>RUNX1</italic> loss were present. We suspected that the dosage of <italic>RUNX1</italic> activity may affect the transforming processes, and FPD/AML with haploinsufficient <italic>RUNX1</italic> allele might require unique genetic events for transformation that are distinct from cases with <italic>RUNX1</italic> point mutation. In order to identify collaborating mutations with haploinsufficient <italic>RUNX1</italic> allele, we performed genome-wide mutational analyses of two transformed cases of FPD/AML with monoallelic <italic>RUNX1</italic> loss. This study was conducted with approval from the internal review board of Keio University School of Medicine and conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki for the use of human tissue or subjects. Samples from the patients were collected with written informed consent.</p>

      <title>Patient 1</title>
      <p>The patient was referred to our hospital for persisting thrombocytopenia from childhood. Bone marrow (BM) examination at the age of 56 revealed normocellular marrow with micromegakaryocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), which led to a diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. However, she started to develop progressive pancytopenia at the age of 63, when the marrow presented severe hypoplasia with moderate fibrosis and no blast proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Of note, dysplasia was not evident and the karyotype was normal.</p>
      <p>Family history revealed high penetrance of hematological malignancies such as AML and myelodysplastic syndrome, which suggested an inherited mutation of <italic>RUNX1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). However, no mutations were discovered in the coding region of <italic>RUNX1</italic>, which suggested the chromosomal microdeletion encompassing <italic>RUNX1</italic> locus, as was reported in some cases of FPD/AML.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Indeed, array-comparative genomic hybridization analysis of the patient's somatic DNA revealed ~285&#x2009;kb heterozygous deletion including the promoter and the 5&#x2032;-half of <italic>RUNX1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). These data clearly demonstrated that this pedigree was an FPD/AML with haploinsufficient <italic>RUNX1</italic> allele.</p>
      <p>We tried to dissect the genetic basis underlying BM failure by whole-exome sequencing of genomic DNA extracted from CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD3<sup>&#x2212;</sup> non T cells of patient's peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This revealed mutations of <italic>TET2</italic> and <italic>MLL2</italic> genes in peripheral T cells at low variant allele frequency (2.0&#x2013;2.2%). Interestingly, non T cells harbored mutation of <italic>RB1</italic> gene in addition to <italic>TET2</italic> and <italic>MLL2</italic> at variant allele frequency of ~10%. These data suggest that <italic>RUNX1</italic>-haploinsufficient hematopoietic stem cells acquired mutations in <italic>TET2</italic> and <italic>MLL2</italic> genes to establish premalignant hematopoietic stem cells, which then underwent malignant transformation by acquiring <italic>RB1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>).</p>

      <title>Patient 2</title>
      <p>The patient presented thrombocytopenia (46 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup>/l) and was diagnosed with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome by BM examination at the age of 29. Two years later, he presented progressive leukocytopenia (2.0 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup>/l) with recurrent bacterial infection. BM aspirates revealed 5.6% of blasts with abnormal karyotype, including trisomy 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), which led to a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome: RAEB-1. BM blasts further increased to 13.0% in the following 2 years, and stem cell transplantation was subsequently performed using human leukocyte antigen-matched cord blood as a donor.</p>
      <p>Family history showed that his father developed AML and his younger brother presented thrombocytopenia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Interestingly, two cousins of the proband presented mental retardation and Down syndrome-like phenotype, respectively. High incidence of hematological malignancies and metal retardation suggested a rare type of FPD/AML caused by microdeletion of chromosome 21, as reported previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> Indeed, array-comparative genomic hybridization analysis using the patient's somatic DNA confirmed ~2&#x2009;Mb heterozygous deletion in chromosome 21 encompassing the entire <italic>RUNX1</italic> gene and a large genomic region of 5&#x2032;-<italic>RUNX1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), which indicates that this pedigree is an FPD/AML with haploinsufficient <italic>RUNX1</italic> allele.</p>
      <p>We next investigated the genetic events critical for myeloid transformation in this patient. As described above, trisomy 21 was noted in the BM cells, which was considered to have contributed to leukemic transformation. Interestingly, fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization analysis of the BM cells revealed duplication of &#x2018;abnormal' chromosome 21 lacking hybridization to the 5&#x2032;- probe for <italic>RUNX1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2c and d</xref>). These data strongly suggested that maintaining haploinsufficient <italic>RUNX1</italic> allele with trisomy 21 was critical for transformation. Furthermore, mutations of <italic>ZRSR2</italic> and <italic>BCOR</italic> genes were detected by whole-exome sequence of genomic DNA from BM mononuclear cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). These data suggest that disruption of <italic>ZRSR2</italic> and <italic>BCOR</italic> genes combined with duplication of abnormal chromosome 21 with <italic>RUNX1</italic> deletion is critical for myeloid transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>).</p>
      <p>We have recently reported recurrent <italic>CDC25C</italic> mutation in ~50% of FPD/AML patients. Hierarchical architecture analysis showed that <italic>CDC25C</italic> mutation was an early event during transformation, which defines a pre-leukemic clone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Mutant CDC25C was shown to confer cells with a proliferative advantage by facilitating their mitotic entry. In the present cases, however, <italic>CDC25C</italic> mutation was absent, and instead, <italic>TET2</italic> mutation or trisomy 21 was identified in each patient. Intriguingly, both of these genetic alterations confer cells with clonal advantage similarly as <italic>CDC25C</italic> mutation. <italic>TET2</italic> mutation has been shown to augment stem cell capacity of hematopoietic stem cells, which then facilitate the expansion of mutated clones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> Trisomy 21 is a well-known chromosomal abnormality associated with AML,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> and it was shown to confer hematopoietic progenitors with enhanced self-renewal capacity without inducing leukemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Interestingly, trisomy 21 has been reported in some transformed or non-transformed cases of FPD/AML.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> In these cases including ours, duplication occurred invariably with abnormal chromosome 21 carrying <italic>RUNX1</italic> mutation, maintaining a single copy of wild-type <italic>RUNX1</italic> gene unaffected. This implies that amplification of dose sensitive genes on chromosome 21 combined with <italic>RUNX1</italic> haploinsufficiency is a critical step for leukemic transformation in FPD/AML.</p>
      <p>Taken together, our study suggests that <italic>RUNX1</italic> haploinsufficiency collaborates with genetic alterations conferring clonal advantage such as <italic>TET2</italic> mutation or trisomy 21 to establish pre-leukemic state, similarly as <italic>RUNX1</italic> point mutation does with <italic>CDC25C</italic> mutation. This study adds valuable molecular insight into the transforming processes in FPD/AML patients.</p>
