        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Congenital dysfibrinogenemia (CD) is a qualitative fibrinogen disorder caused by an abnormal fibrinogen molecule structure, leading to dysfunctional blood coagulation. This study describes 3 cases of dysfibrinogenemia identified in the unrelated Chinese pedigrees.</p>
        <p>Routine coagulation screening tests were performed on the probands and their families. The antigens and functionality of fibrinogen was measured using an immunoturbidimetry assay and the Clauss method, respectively. To identify the genetic mutation responsible for these dysfibrinogens, genomic DNA extracted from the blood was analyzed using PCR amplification and direct sequencing. The presence of the mutant chains was determined using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy. Purified plasma fibrinogen of 3 probands was analyzed using SDS&#x2013;PAGE, fibrinogen clottability, fibrin polymerization, fibrinopeptide release, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).</p>
        <p>The 3 probands had a long thrombin time. Levels of functional fibrinogen were found to be very low, while the fibrinogen antigen was within the normal range. DNA sequencing revealed a heterozygous Arg16His substitution in the fibrinogen A&#x3B1; chain (FGA). The mutant chains were found to be expressed using MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. SDS&#x2013;PAGE did not reveal any difference in the molecular weights of 3 polypeptide chains between normal and abnormal fibrinogens. Fibrinogen clottability showed a slower fibrin clot formation than the healthy control. Fibrin polymerization, after addition of thrombin, showed a prolonged lag phase and decreased final turbidity. The kinetics of fibrinopeptides release revealed a decreased amount of the released fibrinopeptide A. SEM of the patient's fibrin clot was found to be abnormal.</p>
        <p>Results indicate that the 3 probands with dysfibrinogenemia were caused by mutations of A&#x3B1; chain Arg16His. Mutation of this fibrinogen induced dysfunction of plasma fibrinogen.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Fibrinogen, a 340&#x200A;kDa plasma glycoprotein, is synthesized predominantly in the liver and secreted into the blood circulation at a concentration of approximately 200 to 400&#x200A;mg/dL, with a half-life of about 4 days.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> It has a 2-fold axis of symmetry perpendicular to the long axis, which consists of 2 sets of 3 polypeptide chains (A&#x3B1;, B&#x3B2;, &#x3B3;), and each half molecule are joined together in the N-terminal to form the domain central E domain.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> The molecule is stabilized by 29 disulfide bonds. The core structure consists of 2 outer D domains and a central E domain connected through coiled connectors.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> The D domains are made up of the globular C-termini of the B&#x3B2; and &#x3B3; chains, and the C-termini of the A&#x3B1; chains fold back toward the central E domain.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> The N-terminal regions of the A&#x3B1; and B&#x3B2; chains are cleaved during the release of fibrinopeptides. The 3 chains are encoded by paralogous genes FGA, FGB, and FGG (coding for A&#x3B1;, B&#x3B2;, and &#x3B3; chains, respectively), clustered in a 50&#x200A;kb region on chromosome 4 (4q31.3).<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> The FGA gene, composed of 6 exons spanning 7.5&#x200A;kb, is located between FGG (10 exons, 8.5&#x200A;kb) and FGB (8 exons, 8&#x200A;kb). FGB is transcribed in the opposite direction to FGA and FGG.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup></p>
      <p>Congenital dysfibrinogenemia (CD) is a qualitative fibrinogen disorder caused by an abnormal fibrinogen molecule structure, leading to blood coagulation dysfunction. Many studies show that 1 characteristic of CD is normal fibrinogen antigen levels associated with disproportionately low functional activity.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> The vast majority of cases are the result of heterozygous missense mutations in coding region of 1 of the 3 fibrinogen genes (FGA, FGB, or FGG).<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Molecular defects are usually single-base mutations, leading to alterations in the release of fibrinopeptide, fibrin polymerization, fibrin cross-linking, or fibrinolysis of the fibrinogen.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> At least 400 different dysfibrinogenemia pedigrees have been reported worldwide.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Its prevalence is difficult to establish because of a large number of unreported asymptomatic cases.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> Many studies have confirmed that over half of dysfibrinogenemias are asymptomatic, 25% hemorrhage, and 20% thrombosis.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> In fact, most asymptomatic patients with CD are fortuitously diagnosed during routine laboratory examination,<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> similar to the 55% reported by Haverkate and Samama<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> and the 48% reported by Shapiro et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> The clinical management of patients with CD is challenging.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> In this respect, asymptomatic patients with the predisposing genotype are at risk of developing adverse outcomes during the natural course of the disease,<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> so it is worthwhile to determine whether the thrombotic, hemorrhagic, abortion, or surgery-related risks in patients with genetically confirmed CD were associated with any specific demographic factors or mutations.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup></p>
      <p>This paper reports 3 unrelated Chinese cases of CD with mutation defects in the fibrinogen A&#x3B1; Argl6His, which impede the ability of thrombin to release fibrinopeptide A (FpA), impair polymerization, and delay the formation of fibrin clots formation.</p>

        <title>Collection of blood</title>
        <p>A final volume of 9&#x200A;mL of blood from healthy volunteers and patients was drawn by venipuncture to 1&#x200A;mL of 3.8% trisodium citrate (pH 7.4). Plasma was obtained by blood centrifugation at 3000<italic>g</italic> at 4&#xB0;C for 15&#x200A;minutes. All individuals tested agreed to this study at the time of blood collection and provided an informed consent form. The control plasma from the healthy donors is an individual plasma.</p>

        <p>Routine coagulation screening tests, including tests of prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), and clotting factors (VII, VIII, IX, XI, and XII) were performed with citrated plasma samples on an ACL TOP 700 coagulation analyzer (Instrumentation Laboratory, Bedford). The functional fibrinogen level in plasma was measured using a Clauss assay. A Human Fibrinogen ELISA kit (Cusabio, Wuhan, China) was used to measure the antigen fibrinogen level.</p>

        <p>Plasma obtained from the patient was separated by centrifuging twice at 3000&#x200A;rpm for 15&#x200A;minutes, and then recentrifuged after dilution with an equal volume of 0.09&#x200A;M sodium citrate. Protein was precipitated by adding saturated ammonium sulfate (pH 5.5) to 25% saturation at room temperature. After 70&#x200A;minutes, the precipitate was harvested by centrifugation at 4&#xB0;C. It was washed 3 times with 1&#x200A;M ammonium sulfate, each time in a volume approximately equal to twice the original plasma volume. After the third wash, the precipitate was dissolved in 0.005&#x200A;M sodium citrate and reprecipitated with ammonium sulfate (25% saturation). This precipitate was washed once in 1&#x200A;M ammonium sulfate and redissolved in 0.005&#x200A;M sodium citrate.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup></p>

The molecular weight of the purified fibrinogen was determined by SDS&#x2013;PAGE using 8% (w/v) stacking gels and 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide separating gels. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, then destained with a methanol/glacial acetic acid/distilled water solution (4:1:5 by volume). A low-range protein marker kit (Genei, Chennai, India) was used for calibration.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> All gels included a broad range standard mixture (Bio-Rad, Hercules, US) for molecular weight markers.</p>

        <title>Fibrinogen clottability</title>
        <p>Fibrinogen of either the patients or healthy donors was clotted in citrated plasma with addition at a concentration of 10&#x200A;mmol/L EDTA, mix and then added at a final concentration of 20&#x200A;NIH&#x200A;U/mL thrombin. After a 60&#x200A;minutes incubation at 37&#xB0;C, clots were washed in 50&#x200A;mmol/L TRIS buffer (pH 7.4) 5 times and dissolved in 300&#x200A;g/L urea. The fibrinogen concentration in urea was measured at 280&#x200A;nm.</p>

        <p>The plasma fibrinogen level was adjusted to 0.5&#x200A;g/L with a 50&#x200A;mM TRIS 0.1&#x200A;M NaCl 2.5&#x200A;mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> buffer (pH 7.4). Then 90&#x200A;&#x3BC;L of a diluent of fibrinogen (0.5&#x200A;g/L) was incubated with human thrombin (0.1&#x200A;NIH&#x200A;U/mL, final concentration) at room temperature. The time-dependent increase in turbidity induced by the clot formation was measured continuously at intervals of 20&#x200A;seconds for 20&#x200A;minutes at 365&#x200A;nm using ELISA reader Ceres 900 (Bio-tek Instruments, Winooski, VT), as described earlier.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup></p>

        <p>Genomic DNA was extracted from fresh blood samples in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid using standard procedures. The purified genomic DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers comprising all exons of the FGA, FGB, and FGG genes. Then PCR products were sequenced bidirectionally using standard Sanger dideoxy terminator sequencing on an ABI 3730XL sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY). After identification of the causative mutation, the probands&#x2019; family members were genotyped for the mutation.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup></p>

        <title>Kinetic measurement of release of fibrinopeptides</title>
        <p>Reactions were performed in a final volume of 225&#x200A;&#x3BC;L. Briefly, fibrinogen (0.22&#x200A;mg/mL, final concentration) was mixed with <italic>N</italic>-[2-hydroxyethyl] piperazine-<italic>N</italic>&#x2032;-[2-ethanesulfonic acid] (HEPES) pH 7.4 (20&#x200A;mM, final concentration), NaCl (0.12&#x200A;mM, final concentration), and CaCl<sub>2</sub> (1&#x200A;mM, final concentration). The release of fibrinopeptide was measured as a function of time: aliquots of the mixture were incubated with human thrombin (0.02&#x200A;NIH&#x200A;U/mL, final activity) at room temperature for 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60&#x200A;minutes, respectively. The reaction was stopped by boiling for 5&#x200A;minutes. The mixture was centrifuged twice at 17,000&#x200A;rpm for 30&#x200A;minutes at 4&#xB0;C; and the concentration of fibrinopeptides in the supernatant were determined using a Human Fibrinopeptide A (FpA) ELISA kit and Human Fibrinopeptide B (FpB) ELISA kit (Cusabio, Shanghai, China) performed on Tecan Sunrise Elx-808 (BioTek, Shenzhen, China).</p>

        <title>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of fibrin clots</title>
        <p>Fibrin clots were induced to form directly in a microwell plate by addition of 1&#x200A;&#x3BC;L human thrombin (3&#x200A;NIH&#x200A;U/mL final concentration) to 33&#x200A;&#x3BC;L plasma from either the patient or a healthy donor, and the clotting mixture was incubated at room temperature for 120&#x200A;minutes. The clots were washed 3 times with 0.1&#x200A;mol/L PBS (pH 7.4) and fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde in the same buffer for 4&#xB0;C overnight, then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol solutions (50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% concentrations) twice. After the 100% ethanol step, samples were immersed in hexamethyldisilazane 3 times, followed by air-drying overnight in a fume hood. The clots were mounted on aluminum stubs and sputter-coated with 10&#x200A;nm gold. Fibrin clots were examined on field emission scanning electron microscope (Tescan, Brno, Czech Republic), as described previously.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p>

        <title>Patients and routine coagulation tests</title>
        <p>In family I, the proband was a 44-year-old man (I-1) with a low fibrinogen level as indicated by the Clauss method (0.78&#x200A;g/L). He had specifically prolonged TT (21.3&#x200A;seconds), but his fibrinogen antigen, which was detected using ELISA was not low at all (3.58&#x200A;g/L, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). His coagulation factors (VIII, IX, XI:C, and XII:C) were all within the normal ranges. He had no evidence of bleeding tendencies or thrombosis. His 64-year-old mother (I-4) also presented with a low functional fibrinogen level and prolonged TT, as did his children (I-6). Other families had normal coagulation test results (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study characterized 3 unrelated Chinese's families affected by dysfibrinogenemia, which the probands did not have obvious symptoms of bleeding or thrombosis tendency. A&#x3B1;-chain Arg16His substitution was identified as a causative mutation.</p>
      <p>Mutations occurring at the thrombin cleavage site of the fibrinogen alpha chain Arg16-Gly17 are a common cause of the disease.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Similar results were reported by Casini et al<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>: FGA mutations affecting residue Arg16 (i.e., Arg16His and Arg16Cys) at the FpA thrombin cleavage site were frequent in 13.9% and 8.9% of patients, respectively.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> The results indicate that the substitution of the A&#x3B1;-chain residue Arg16His can prevent thrombin cleavage of the scissile A&#x3B1; Arg16-Gly17 bond, thus delaying the release of FpA and disrupting of the initial alignment of fibrin monomers into protofibrils, and then these changes can impair the subsequent fibrin clot formation.</p>
      <p>Mass spectrometric analysis is very useful technique that can reveal the expression of an abnormal chains with the mutation in A&#x3B1;-chain Arg16His. We detected a 1082.23&#x200A;<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> signal corresponding to the GGGVRGPRVVE (A&#x3B1; 12&#x2013;22) peptide of the normal fibrinogen A&#x3B1; chain. Anomalous peptide peaks were present at 1063.18&#x200A;Da GGGVHGPRVVE peptide (A&#x3B1;12&#x2013;22) of an abnormal fibrinogen A&#x3B1;-chain as observed in the MS spectrum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p>
      <p>Molecular defects in fibrinogen may result in impair the release of fibrinopeptides. This is consistent with structural studies of abnormal fibrinogen. The specific cleavage of fibrinogen A&#x3B1; Arg16-Gly17 bond results in release of fibrinopeptides A (FpA). The data from fibrinopeptide release demonstrated that both the rate and extent of FpA release from the propositus was abnormal while compared with the normal control, particularly at the first 60&#x200A;seconds. FpB release appeared moderately delayed. Stucki et al<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> and Mathonnet et al<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> also reported that FpA was released at a slow rate. Lewis et al<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> indicated that the prior release of FpA is essential to the subsequent release of FpB. Kotlin et al<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> showed another point of view that some FpB were released from the fibrinogen molecules without any prior release of FpA. Andes et al<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> also suggested that the cleavage and release of FpB are in some way dependent upon the prior release of FpA and the polymerization of fibrinogen. On the basis of these observations, Blomback et al<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> proposed that removal of FpA leads to change in conformation of the fibrinogen molecule and that these conformational changes in turn increase the cleavability of FpB.</p>
      <p>The removal of FpA exposes a polymerization site knobs &#x201C;A&#x201D; that initiates polymerization by docking to a hole &#x201C;a&#x201D; in the D domain of a neighboring molecules.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> Impaired cleavage of FpA may resulted in delayed fibrin polymerization. It found that a fibrin monomer polymerization curve of the propositus&#x2019; fibrinogen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) showed a longer lag time, shallower slope, and lower final amplitude than healthy controls. The most noticeable delay occurred during the final stages of appearing a fibrin clot. Similar results were obtained by Stucki,<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> Kotlin et al,<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> and Mathonnet et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> They all have a common characteristic in thrombin-induced fibrin polymerization which is markedly delayed but the individuals do not exhibit common clinical symptoms.</p>
      <p>Knobs &#x201C;A&#x201D;&#x2014;holes &#x201C;a&#x201D; interactions give rise to form double-stranded twisting fibrils in a staggered overlapping end-to-middle domain arrangement.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> Fibrils undergo lateral associations to make up the physical meshwork of the coagulum. The initiating event in normal clot formation is the release of FPA, which exposes 1 set of polymerization domains.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> The aberrant alpha-chain lacking the amino acids of FpA may impact the first steps of fibrin polymerization, which are driven by knobs &#x201C;A&#x201D;&#x2014;holes &#x201C;a&#x201D; interactions, and thus lead to the variety of the network structure. We found that the clottability of propositus&#x2019; fibrinogen is reduced in comparison with the healthy control. SEM showed that the morphology of the patients&#x2019; clots were different from that of the healthy control. The propositus&#x2019; fibrin fibers had many small branched fibers with twisted ends and large pores compared with healthy control.</p>
      <p>It is not surprising that patients with A&#x3B1;Arg16His dysfibrinogenemia are mostly asymptomatic.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> However, patients with the same mutation have also been reported have a tendency toward severe bleeding<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> and postpartum DIC.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> That is why CD clinical manifestation shows extensive heterogeneity and increase the difficulty of treatment. Bleeding tendency, even usually very mild, was reported in about 20% of the published cases.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Kotlin et al<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> noted that it is very important that patients should be advised the possible risks of bearing this mutation so they can plan for their futures.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, patients with CD deserve better predictive tests for clinical complications. Structure&#x2013;function analysis of this mutant can provide diverse insight into the variable roles of fibrinogen and may ultimately lead to better patient care once the clinical implications of this mutation are understood.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup></p>
