  <body>
    <p>Dear Editor,</p>
    <p>A 24-year-old male with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and
another 12-year-old boy with vernal keratoconjunctivitis
were started on 0.1% olapatidine eye-drops (Winolap,
Sun pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, which contains 0.02%
benzalkonium chloride [BAK] as preservative) twice daily.
After using it for six and eight weeks respectively, they
presented with complaints of redness, irritation and itching
around both eyes, particularly over the eyelids, over the
preceding seven to 10 days. The first patient was using the
eye-drops once daily, while the second patient was compliant.
Further history is confined to the first patient only due to their
resemblance.</p>
    <p>On examination, the conjunctival congestion had reduced
after using the new drug, but the periocular area was inflamed,
erythematous and areas of depigmentation were noted. A
dermatology consultation was sought and the patient was
diagnosed to have allergic contact dermatitis, secondary to
usage of eye-drops. He was advised to stop using eye-drops and
was started on local application of steroid, 0.05% fluticasone
propionate lotion (Flutivate, BSK India Ltd), over the
erythematous areas. The erythema and symptoms responded
well to steroid application. The steroid was tapered over the
next month. However, areas of periocular depigmentation,
confined to the eyelid region, persisted.</p>
    <p>Both these patients were on 0.05% azelastine eye-drops (Sun
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd containing 0.00004 ml BAK per ml
as preservative) before they were switched over to olapatidine
and had never experienced such a reaction before. They were
restarted on 0.05% azelastine eye-drops. The first patient is
still on follow-up, and the periocular depigmented areas have
decreased considerably in the last one year. In the second patient,
depigmentation persisted until the third month after the reaction;
however, he did not follow up with us after this period.</p>
    <p>Olapatidine has both anti-histaminic and mast cell
stabilizing action. It is gaining popularity for the treatment
of chronic conditions like vernal keratoconjunctivitis and
allergic conjunctivitis lately, due to its dual mode of action and
convenient once or twice a day dosing schedule, thus possibly
improving compliance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> In addition, no major adverse reactions
have been reported so far<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> while the common minor
adverse reactions reported are hyperemia and ocular discomfort.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></p>
    <p>Olapatidine has been shown to have better local tolerability
when compared to other well-known forms of medication such
as 2% cromolyn sodium and 0.5% azelastine hydrochloride.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> It has been proven to be safe in children and adolescents as well
in various studies including the 0.2% formulation which can be
used once daily.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> However, most studies evaluating this drug
are short-term studies, mostly six to 10-week trials.</p>
    <p>Depigmentation may be associated with contact allergic
dermatitis or may occur as a post-inflammatory phenomenon.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> Contact allergic dermatitis has not been reported with
olapatidine eye-drops so far. However, the preservative used
in the eye-drop, BAK, can cause allergic dermatitis. Both
patients had been using BAK-containing eye drops before
starting and also after discontinuing olapatidine and have
not had any such reactions. The concentration of BAK in
azelastine is however much lower when compared to that in
the olapatidine preparation used by us. This may thus imply
that either the active ingredient olapatidine or the higher
concentration of BAK must have caused the allergic contact
dermatitis.</p>
    <p>Depigmentation of the periocular area can have a
significant psychological impact on the patient, especially
considering the age group in which this drug is mostly used.
The erythema and itching subsided after steroid application,
but the depigmentation persisted and in the first patient it
is still persisting, though faintly, even after one year of the
episode.</p>
    <p>The best way to confirm the causative agent is to re-challenge
the patients with the same eye-drops, however this was thought
to be inappropriate in the patients&#x2032; best interest. Though the cause
and effect of olapatidine and allergic contact dermatitis could
not be proven here as it was only an observation, this possibility
should be kept in mind in view of these two cases. Patients who
are put on this drug should be warned about allergic symptoms
and the drug withheld as soon allergy is suspected.</p>
