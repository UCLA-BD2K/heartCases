        <p>Vitiligo is a dreaded disease in India due to its social and cultural consequences.
PUVA and PUVAsol are the main treatment modalities for vitiligo vulgaris. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first case of accidental PUVA burns eventuating in
prurigo nodularis lesions to be reported in a female patient who was undergoing home
PUVA therapy. The itch is so prominent and disabling that the focus of the patient
has shifted from treating her vitiligo to ameliorating the pruritus.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Vitiligo is a dreaded disease in India due to its disfiguring nature and stigmatization.
We describe a woman who had accidental burns during home treatment with PUVA. She had an
underlying atopic diathesis. The burns healed leaving severe prurigo nodularis, which
caused crippling pruritus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time prurigo
nodularis has been reported in the dermatologic literature as a complication of
accidental PUVA burns in a vitiligo patient. </p>
    </sec>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 50-year-old woman presented to this clinic with severely pruritic nodules and plaques
on her legs and breasts. She developed vitiligo at the age of 18 years and had been
unsuccessfully treated with many drugs. In 1991, she was treated with home psoralen plus
ultraviolet-A radiation (PUVA), using 20 mg of oral methoxsalen. The light source used
was a set of 4 tube lights of 100W, emitting UVA with wavelengths between 315 and 350
nm, and she exposed the affected areas for three minutes three times a week. Within
about 5 months, there was marked improvement of the vitiligo lesions on her legs and
also total clearing of the lesions on her face, except for the ones on the lips. Around
this time, she accidentally fell asleep during her PUVA sessions and woke up 60 minutes
later with blistering burns on her breasts and legs, which took a month to heal. During
the healing stage, she started developing thickened skin, nodules and plaques on her
legs and breasts, which were intensely itchy. She was given emollients, topical
steroids, antihistamines, individually and in combination, with little benefit. Many
nodules coalesced to form scaly plaques. Then, her homeopath husband started treating
her with some homeopathic medication, which apparently caused resolution of the lesions
for many years. The lesions only reappeared in 2004. Several physicians and
dermatologists diagnosed her condition as psoriasis and post-burn keloids. She was
prescribed oral steroids by a private practitioner for a few months, which was later
stopped as she developed diabetes. She now has excruciating itching, which has severely
affected her quality of life. </p>
      <p>On examination, she had vitiligo on her breasts and lower limbs, showing perifollicular
pigmentation. Her legs were studded with thick, horny, hyperkeratotic nodules with a
rough surface, many of them coalescing to form plaques on the anterior aspect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). She had severely pruritic erythematous
nodules on the breasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>). The skin on her
face, abdomen, back and upper limbs was normal. She was diabetic, hypothyroid and took
metformin and thyroxine daily. Her blood work up and serum chemistry were normal, except
for an IgE level of 700 IU/ml, with no history, signs or symptoms of atopy such as
chronic itching, eczema, allergic rhinitis or asthma. She, however, had a family history
of eczema and allergic rhinitis. A skin biopsy taken from the nodule showed a
superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with moderate irregular epidermal
hyperplasia. The papillary dermis was thickened with papillomatosis and showed thickened
bundles of collagen in a vertical array. The capillaries in the papillary dermis were
increased in number and thick-walled. The granular layer was thickened and the stratum
corneum showed marked compact orthokeratosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure
3</xref>). One of the sections showed abundant deposit of amyloid in the papillary
dermis. The histological diagnosis was prurigo nodularis (PN) associated with lichen
amyloidosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3</xref>). We started her on 900 mg
of gabapentin with topical halobetasol and petrolatum, and she reported a relief of
about 20% of her itching in 30 days. </p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>We report a case of prurigo nodularis occurring on the sites of PUVA burns in a vitiligo
patient. Oral PUVA, which is one of the most common treatment modalities for India's
millions of vitiligo patients, has side effects that may be short-term or long-term.
Short-term adverse effects include erythema, swelling, dry skin, pruritus, axillary
freckling, increased recurrence of herpes simplex virus and, rarely, phototoxic
blisters. Possible long-term adverse effects are accelerated skin ageing with wrinkle
formation, telangectasias, lentigines, elastosis, xerosis and pigmentary changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref></sup> High cumulative PUVA exposure is associated with a dose-related increase in the
risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer, particularly genital and cutaneous squamous cell
carcinoma, in Caucasians only.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup> However, nodular prurigo has never been reported. </p>
      <p>Accidental burns during photochemotherapy have been reported too, including burns during
self-treatment, as seen in this patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref></sup> Bothersome pruritus following burns per se is a known phenomenon, though there is
a paucity of long-term prospective studies documenting the course and magnitude of this phenomenon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref></sup> Burns are known inducers of neuropathic itch. A study by Van Loey et al.
documented itching at 3, 12 and 24 months after burns and recorded mild to severe
itching in 87%, 70% and 67% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref></sup> However, this appears to be the first case of prurigo nodularis developing after
accidental PUVA burns. We propose the following logical sequence. Vitiliginous skin is
more prone to burns. The accidental PUVA burns due to gross overdose initiated the itch
in this patient, who also had atopic diathesis, indicated by a high level of serum IgE,
and a family history of eczema and allergic rhinitis. Itching is known to induce
hyperplastic cutaneous response, and this probably would have lead to the development of
prurigo nodularis (PN) in this patient. There is a report of a bomb blast injury causing
prurigo nodularis-like lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref></sup> The diagnosis of prurigo nodularis is based upon family and personal history,
typical clinical presentation and distribution of the lesions along the cleavage lines
(Langer's lines) of the skin and is confirmed by histopathology. The amyloid deposit
seen in some sections could be due to the chronic scratching in PN. </p>
      <p>Highly characteristic of PN is the presence of thick compact orthohyperkeratosis; the
hairy palm sign (folliculosebaceous units in nonvolar skin in conjunction with a thick
and compact cornified layer, like that of volar skin); irregular epidermal hyperplasia
or pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia; focal parakeratosis; hypergranulosis; fibrosis of
the papillary dermis with vertically arranged collagen fibers; increased number of
fibroblasts and capillaries; a superficial, perivascular and/or interstitial
inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, macrophages and, to a lesser extent, eosinophils
and neutrophils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref></sup> Histological analysis of lesional and nonlesional skin in PN has demonstrated
reduced density of nerve endings, findings suggesting a cutaneous neuropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref></sup> Interestingly, the itch induced by burns, which would have played a major role in
the development of PN, is also neuropathic in origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref></sup> The rationale of using gabapentin is that it has been tried with varying success
in both burn-induced itching and PN. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref></sup>
</p>
      <p>We believe we are reporting the first case of accidental PUVA burns developing prurigo
nodularis in a woman with atopic diathesis in the dermatologic literature. </p>
