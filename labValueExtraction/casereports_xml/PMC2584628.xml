          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Ellis-van Creveld (EvC) syndrome is characterized by short limbs, short ribs, postaxial polydactyly, dysplastic nails and teeth and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. We report a family with complex septal cardiac defects, rhizomelic limb shortening, and polydactyly, without the typical lip, dental, and nail abnormalities of EvC. The phenotype was inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, with one instance of pseudodominant inheritance.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec sec-type="methods">
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Because of the phenotypic overlap with EvC, microsatellite markers were used to test for linkage to the <italic>EVC/EVC2 </italic>locus. The results did not exclude linkage, so samples were sequenced for mutations.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>We identified a c.1868T&gt;C mutation in <italic>EVC</italic>, which predicts p.L623P, and was homozygous in affected individuals.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>We conclude that this <italic>EVC </italic>mutation is hypomorphic and that such mutations can cause a phenotype of cardiac and limb defects that is less severe than typical EvC. <italic>EVC </italic>mutation analysis should be considered in patients with cardiac and limb malformations, even if they do not manifest typical EvC syndrome.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (EvC, MIM 225500) is characterized by short limbs, short ribs, postaxial polydactyly and dysplastic nails and teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The phenotype is variable and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and parental consanguinity has been confirmed in about 30% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. About two-thirds of affected individuals have a cardiovascular malformation, usually an atrial septal or atrioventricular septal defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The disorder was mapped to chromosome 4p16 and mutations in <italic>EVC </italic>and <italic>EVC2 </italic>genes, located in a head-to-head configuration, have been associated with this syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The EvC phenotype is variable but the range of variability has not been defined. We present here a clinical and molecular analysis of a large family with a phenotype that partially overlapped with EvC, but the affected individuals did not manifest many of the specific features of EvC.</p>

          <title>Phenotype of Proband</title>
          <p>Individual IV-15 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) was examined at Gulhane Military Hospital, Ankara, Turkey. He presented at 24-years, was generally healthy, and had not undergone any major surgeries. Details of his birth history are not available. He is the product of a then 29-year-old healthy father and 21-year-old healthy mother who are thought to have a common ancestor, but the precise relationship is not known. He had four limb postaxial polydactyly with bilateral cutaneous syndactyly of toes 2&#x2013;3. His toenails were dystrophic. Cubitus valgus, pectus deformity, narrow thorax, rhizomelic shortness of the limbs, mild scoliosis, and an S1 spina bifida occulta were also present. Cardiology consultation revealed ASD and VSD of the heart. He married his first cousin and they had two spontaneous abortions, but no information was available on the phenotype of these abortuses.</p>

              <p><bold>Pedigree of the family.</bold> The figure also shows haplotype analysis using markers encompassing both <italic>EVC </italic>and <italic>EVC2</italic>. The c.1868T&gt;C variant is also presented in relation to the three markers used for linkage. The position of the markers is indicated in kilobase pairs from 4pter according to the March 2006 genome build. A hyphen (-) in the haplotype table means the marker was not typed in that person. The small "x" in the haplotype of individuals IV-11 and IV-15 indicates the suggested crossovers. The neonatal deaths of individuals IV-18 to IV-22 are thought to be caused by the same phenotype that affected the patients described in the case report. They had polydactyly and are thought to have congenital heart disease as they died in the neonatal period with cyanosis.</p>

          <title>Detailed Phenotype of Individual IV-9</title>
          <p>This 38-year-old male was examined at the NIH Clinical Center and Children's National Medical Center. He is the brother of the proband IV-15 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). No information is available regarding the pregnancy or birth records. He was born with bilateral postaxial polydactyly of the hands (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) and unilateral postaxial (or central) polydactyly of the right foot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), and he had poor exercise tolerance throughout childhood. At age 17 years he was diagnosed with an unknown type of septal defect and valvular abnormality. He underwent cardiac surgery at ages 17 and 30 years. The second operation was for replacement of the mitral valve and re-closing the septal defect. A pacemaker was placed after the first operation, but this was removed shortly thereafter as it was infected. The patient claimed that after removal, arrhythmia never recurred. He had a transient episode of aphasia or memory loss, associated with an incorrect adjustment of coagulation therapy and subsequently the symptoms resolved.</p>

          <p>He was examined at the NIH Clinical Center in 2007. His weight was 81.4 kg, height was 161.5 cm and head circumference was 57 cm (+ 0.8 SD) (Turkish norm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. He had no facial dysmorphic features except for a relatively narrow and tall face and an occipital osteophyte. No extra frenulum or buccal adhesions were present. Hypodontia was evident including maxillary lateral incisors and mandibular first and second molars. No thoracic deformity was noted except scars due to previous operations. He had a bilateral intermediate type of postaxial polydactyly of the hands with a relatively small, but well formed, supernumerary triphalangeal digits. His dermatoglyphic pattern on the left was U,U,U,U,W and on the right was W,U,W,R,R (the sixth digits could not be assessed). He had short, but not hypoplastic, nails on the left hand on the second and third digits, on the right hand of the second digit only (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Both sixth fingers had a small fingernail and they had normal passive mobility, but active flexion only occurred at the MCP joint. The second fingers of both hands were short with a stubbed or squared tip. His elbows had an increased carrying angle with normal mobility. He had postaxial polydactyly and partial cutaneous syndactyly of toes 4&#x2013;5 of the right foot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). He had laterally deviated and broad great toes with thick nails. The left foot was otherwise normal. Radiographs showed (in addition to the external findings above) a coned epiphysis of the left second middle phalanx and prominent styloid processes of the ulnae (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), an irregular notched tip of the distal phalanges of the halluces (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), bowed humeri (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), fusion of the right proximal tibia and fibula (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>), and spina bifida occulta of S1. In addition, a pattern profile analysis of the left hand was performed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Cardiovascular evaluation including echo- and electrocardiography showed mechanical mitral valve replacement and a small membranous VSD and first-degree trifascicular block. Renal ultrasonography showed a solitary 1.8 cm cyst in the right kidney. Mild splenomegaly was also noted. He had mildly elevated hemoglobin levels, suggestive of secondary polycythemia, possibly due to high altitude and obstructive sleep apnea. He had a normal 46,XY male karyotype (resolution between 300&#x2013;400 bands). See Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> for a summary of phenotypic features in this patient and his son.</p>

          <title>Individual V-8</title>
          <p>This 7-1/2-year-old male was also examined at the NIH Clinical Center and Children's National Medical Center. He, the son of IV-9, was the product of a gravida 2, para 2 23-year-old mother. The pregnancy was notable for abnormal fetal movements and poor weight gain. At the seventh month of gestation a fetal ultrasound examination revealed a protuberant anterior chest wall and short limbs, but polydactyly was not detected. After a spontaneous vaginal delivery his birth weight was 3,250 g (10&#x2013;25<sup>th</sup> centile), but his birth length and head circumference are unknown. Four limb polydactyly and a heart murmur were noted at birth. At the age of 6 months he was diagnosed with an atrial and ventricular septal defect and mitral valve insufficiency, which was repaired at age 4 years. At this time his polydactyly was repaired. Generally he was healthy. He is described as successful student in second grade attending regular school. His height was 113 cm, weight 17.4 kg (both 3&#x2013;10<sup>th </sup>centile) (Turkish norms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]) and head circumference 49 cm. (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) Normative head circumference data for this population are disparate: 49 cm is &lt;2<sup>nd </sup>centile from one source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] while this is well within the lower limits of normal, 3<sup>rd </sup>&#x2013; 10<sup>th </sup>centile, from a second source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Inner canthal distance was 2.5 cm (3<sup>rd </sup>&#x2013; 10<sup>th </sup>centile), interpupillary distance was 5.1 cm (~10<sup>th </sup>centile) and his outer canthal distance was 7.8 cm (~10<sup>th </sup>centile) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. His nasal tip was broader than his nasal root. Oral examination revealed a single mandibular central incisor. He had two excess mandibular frenula, on each side of the mouth. He also had a central mandibular frenulum. The chest circumference was 53.5 cm (3<sup>rd </sup>&#x2013; 25<sup>th </sup>centile) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. He had a mild lower pectus excavatum and several scars from cardiac surgery. He had a grade 5&#x2013;6/6 holosystolic murmur. The upper extremities were notable for increased carrying angle, but with normal elbow mobility. Total hand length was 11.8 cm on the left, 12 cm on the right (both &lt;3<sup>rd </sup>centile) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). He had pseudoclubbing of the thumbs bilaterally. He had short, but not hypoplastic, fingernails 1 through 4 bilaterally with a normal fifth fingernail. His digits were proportionately short compared to his hands. Dermatoglyphic pattern on the left was U,U,U,U,W; on the right was U/W,U,U,U,A. He had lateral palm scars from postaxial digit removal. He had partial cutaneous syndactyly of the second and third toes bilaterally and clinodactyly of the second toes with broad toe tips (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C,D</xref>). All biochemical and hormone blood and urine tests were within the normal range. Dental examination revealed absent maxillary and mandibular lateral incisors. Abdominal, renal and scrotal ultrasounds were normal. Radiographs showed, in addition to the external findings, residual appearance of post-axial polydactyly of hands and prominent cone-shaped epiphyses in the proximal and middle phalanges of all digits (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>), atypical shapes of some of the middle and distal phalanges of the feet (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>) mild lateral bowing of both humeri (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>), spina bifida occulta of S1, and postoperative sternal wires. Pattern profile analysis of the hands was performed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The bone age was about 6 years and 6 months. Echo- and electrocardiographic evaluation showed a residual cleft mitral valve and mitral regurgitation. He had a normal 46,XY karyotype (resolution 300&#x2013;400 bands).</p>

          <p>The affected family resides in a village of about 1,000 people in Eastern Turkey. Most of the inhabitants of the village claim ancestry from Central Asia and this particular extended family believe their ancestors migrated there from Kyrgyzstan some 150 years ago. The pedigree (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) of the family shows that there are consanguineous marriages. The pedigree shows a number of neonatal deaths (e.g., children of III-11 and III-12), reportedly affected with polydactyly of the hands and feet. In addition to the surviving individuals described above, another patient (IV-14) survived to adult age after open-heart operations, but died at age 31 years of cardiac complications. Another nuclear family within the pedigree includes two patients, V-13 and V-14, with a single atrium and bilateral polydactyly of the upper and lower limbs, but without other features of EvC. They died at ages 3 months and 3 years, respectively, because of the heart condition. Another individual in another nuclear family (V-1) had a VSD without any other abnormalities.</p>

        <title>Subjects</title>
        <p>The study included clinical analysis of the nuclear family described above (IV-9, IV-10, V-8, V-9) and molecular analysis of 15 additional family members (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The study was reviewed and approved by the IRB at NHGRI and the ethics committee of Ankara University Medical Faculty. Peripheral blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes and DNA was isolated by the salting out method (Qiagen, Inc.).</p>
        <p>Because of the phenotypic overlap with EvC, candidate linkage analysis to the <italic>EVC</italic>/<italic>EVC2 </italic>locus was performed. The markers used in this analysis are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Haplotyping was performed manually. The <italic>EVC </italic>and <italic>EVC2 </italic>genes were amplified from genomic DNA using standard methods, sequenced with the BigDye kit, and analyzed on an ABI 3100 sequencer (Applera Corp), with electropherogram analysis performed using the Sequencher program (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor).</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Three markers were genotyped (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and all were partially or completely informative in the family. The haplotypes encompassing both <italic>EVC </italic>and <italic>EVC2 </italic>could not exclude linkage to this locus and therefore the genes were considered as candidates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Changes in <italic>EVC</italic></title>
        <p>We identified seven sequence changes in the <italic>EVC </italic>when compared to the reference sequence. Six of the seven were recognized polymorphisms with appreciable minor allele frequencies (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). We also detected a c.1868T&gt;C sequence variation in Exon 13 of <italic>EVC</italic>, which predicts p.L623P that was homozygous in the father and son and heterozygous in the mother (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The remaining 16 samples were assayed for this variant and all obligate carriers were heterozygous and individual IV-15 was homozygous (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Individual V-1 was heterozygous for the variant but was previously judged not to be affected with the same phenotype as the rest of the family because he did not have polydactyly. This variant was not listed in dbSNP. This variant was not detected among 171 Caucasian control chromosomes. The <italic>EVC </italic>sequence was aligned with nine orthologous protein sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). The leucine at this position was conserved among seven orthologues. The other residues present at this location in the remaining two species were a phenylalanine in rat and mouse.</p>

        <p>Three sequence variants were detected in <italic>EVC2 </italic>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Two heterozygous SNPs were detected in exons 14 and 20 of <italic>EVC2 </italic>in the father, whereas the son was homozygous. This excluded the telomeric portion of <italic>EVC2 </italic>from causing the phenotype, as both the father and son should be homozygous for the causative locus. All of these variants were recognized in dbSNP as variants with appreciable minor allele frequency. We conclude that none of these <italic>EVC2 </italic>variants are pathologic.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The phenotype of the affecteds shared some features with the description of EvC, but their features were not a good match for this disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The features in common with EvC include short stature, hypodontia, congenital heart defects, postaxial polydactyly of the feet and hands, and cone-shaped epiphyses of phalanges. However, these patients did not manifest many of the more distinct features of EvC. The patients reported here manifested rhizomelic shortening of the limbs rather than the mesomelic shortening that is typical for EvC. The pattern profile analysis is similar to, but less severe than, that seen in patients with EvC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Also absent were the upper lip defects and hypertelorism. A major feature of EvC is a narrow thorax, and the patients reported here had only pectus excavatum with normal chest circumference. The nails were short, but were not hypoplastic or spoon shaped as reported for EvC. None of the characteristic genital abnormalities were observed in the two patients. The mucobuccal fold, which is the most striking and consistent oral manifestation of the disease was not present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Neonatal teeth were also not reported in our patients. Overall, the patients had several of the less specific manifestations of EvC but few of the specific ones. For these reasons, we felt that they did not warrant a clinical diagnosis of EvC, but we felt that they shared enough features to warrant that mutations in <italic>EVC </italic>or <italic>EVC2 </italic>should be excluded.</p>
      <p>The differential diagnosis includes McKusick Kaufman and Bardet Biedl syndromes. However, additional abnormalities of these two syndromes were not present in this family. Weyers acrodental dysostosis, an autosomal dominantly inherited allelic variant of EvC was excluded primarily because of the inheritance pattern, and again becuase the overall features in this family are not a good match for that disorder (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Distinctive radiographic features also distinguish the phenotype in this family from other chondrodystrophies such as achondroplasia, chondrodysplasia punctata, Morquio syndrome, short rib polydactyly, and cartilage-hair hypoplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Sporadic cases with single atrium/atrioventricular canal malformation and hexodactyly may be variants of the syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p>
      <p>The detection of haplotype inheritance in this family that was consistent with the recessive and pseudodominant inheritance observed in the pedigree led us to sequence <italic>EVC </italic>and <italic>EVC2 </italic>in their entirety. As these genes are separated by less than 20 kb in a head-to-head arrangement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], few recombinants would be expected to occur between the genes, as was observed here. As mutations in either gene can cause EvC and there is no apparent genotype-phenotype correlation for this locus heterogeneity, we sequenced both genes. We detected a c.1868T&gt;C sequence variation in Exon 13 of <italic>EVC</italic>, which predicts p.L623P. This variant was on the chromosome segregating with the phenotype in all tested family members (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This variant is not described in dbSNP, was not present in a panel of 171 control chromosomes of Caucasian origin, and L623 is conserved across seven species, although this residue was a phenylalanine in two rodent species. This suggests that this residue is important, but not critical for the function of EVC. We conclude that <italic>EVC </italic>c.1868T&gt;C, p.L623P is the causative mutation in this family and suggest that this allele is hypomorphic.</p>
      <p><italic>EVC </italic>has 21 coding exons spanning 120 KB of genomic DNA and encodes a 992 amino acid protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Only 25 mutations have been described in this gene (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Of those 25 mutations, 21 of them can be considered to be likely null mutations (frameshift, nonsense, splicing, and multiexon deletions). Of the remaining four mutations, one was a c.904_906delAAG, which predicts p.K302del. Three missense mutations have been described. These included p.S307P, p.R443Q, and p.Q896H. The p.S307P change has been associated with Weyer's acrodental dysostosis in a father of a girl with features of EvC. The daughter had, in addition to the p.S307P change, another frameshift mutation that led to EvC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Another missense mutation, p.R443Q was heterozygous in a father and daughter, who both had no classical manifestations of EvC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. They both had postaxial polydactyly of the hands and feet, partial atrioventricular canal with common atrium, bilateral agenesis of the upper lateral incisors, enamel abnormalities, but normal stature. This phenotype is somewhat similar to the family presented here. It has been suggested that patients with single atrium or atrioventricular canal malformation and polydactyly may be variants of EvC. A homozygous mutation, p.Q896H was identified in a patient with classical EvC features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Unfortunately no detailed information was given on the phenotype of this patient. Recently a 520-kb homozygous deletion comprising <italic>EVC</italic>, <italic>EVC2</italic>, <italic>C4orf6</italic>, and <italic>STK32B</italic>, caused by recombination between long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) elements has been described in a consanguineous Egyptian family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The phenotype in that family is distinct from the family reported here because of mental retardation in addition to the classical features of EvC, which may be due to the involvement of <italic>C4orf6 </italic>and <italic>STK32B</italic>.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>We conclude that mutations in <italic>EVC </italic>can cause limb and cardiac abnormalities with other minor anomalies and that these phenotypes may not meet the threshold for typical EvC syndrome. We hypothesize that mutations in EVC can cause a broad range of clinical phenotypes and that mutations in this gene should be sought in patients who present with the dyad of septal anomalies and polydactyly.</p>
