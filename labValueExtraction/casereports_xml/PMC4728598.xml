    <p>Clinical data: Heart murmur was identified at auscultation in childhood, but the
diagnosis of aortic coarctation associated with atrial septal defect was attained when
the patient was 15 years old. The patient practiced regular physical activity and did
not report symptoms for up to 5 years, when he became sedentary. He received specific
anti-hypertensive medication.</p>
    <p>Physical examination: patient was eupneic, acyanotic, obese, ample pulses in the upper
limbs and decreased in the lower limbs. Weight: 113 kg; height: 177 cm; Body Mass Index
(BMI): 36.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; RUL BP was the same in the LUL, 149/89 mmHg; right
inferior limb BP = 113/77 mmHg; Heart rate (HR): 82 bpm; oxygen saturation of 95%. The
aorta was clearly palpable at the suprasternal notch.</p>
    <p>The apex beat was not palpable in the precordium and there were no systolic impulses in
the left sternal border (LSB). Normal heart sounds; constant split second sound and
rough systolic murmur + / ++ / 4, was heard in the upper LSB. The liver was not
palpable.</p>

      <title>Complementary Examinations</title>
      <p>The Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, first-degree atrioventricular block and
complete right bundle-branch block. A P: +50&#xBA;, AQRS: +115&#xBA;, AT: 0&#xBA;. QRS Duration:
0.14", PR 0.21 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>
<fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Chest X-ray showing an enlarged cardiac silhouette at the expense of the
right ventricular border, with increased pulmonary vasculature,
especially in the pulmonary hila. The aorta is not bulging despite the
coarctation, but there is hyperrefringency on the edge of the ribs. The
electrocardiogram highlights signs of first-degree atrioventricular
block and complete right bundle-branch block.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="abc-106-01-0070-g01"/></fig>
</p>
      <p>Chest x-ray showed a slightly enlarged cardiac area (cardiothoracic index of 0.61) at
the expense of the right ventricular border. Pulmonary vasculature was increased and
the medial border was rectified. There was no aortic dilatation, but
hyperrefringency on the lower edges of the ribs was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>The echocardiogram showed marked right heart chamber dilation (right ventricle - RV
52 mm), a slight increase of the left atrium (45 mm), systolic blood pressure of 44
mmHg in the RV. The ascending aorta was normal (37 mm) and showed no myocardial
hypertrophy (septum/posterior wall of 11 mm). Left ventricular function (75%) and
size (39 mm) were normal. TEE showed major discontinuity of the atrial septum at two
points, of 8 and 26 mm each, with edges present in the entire contour. No
abnormalities were identified in the aorta.</p>
      <p>CT angiography of the aorta, performed after clinical suspicion of aortic
coarctation, confirmed the diagnosis, immediately distal to the left subclavian
artery, with paravertebral, mediastinal and intercostal artery collaterals, which
caused opacification of the descending aorta, with 16 mm in diameter. The internal
thoracic arteries and the supra-aortic trunks were enlarged. Marked right chambers
and pulmonary trunk enlargement was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
      <p>
<fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Transesophageal echocardiography shows two ASDs, measuring 8 and 26 mm,
in A. Magnetic resonance imaging clearly depicts, in B and C, the aortic
coarctation after the left subclavian artery with exuberant collateral
circulation into the descending aorta; at the angiography in D, extreme
aortic coarctation showing actual aortic disruption after the left
subclavian artery and the 15 x 40 mm stent placed at this site, in E;

with stent implant in the aorta (arrows).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="abc-106-01-0070-g02"/></fig>
</p>
      <p>Clinical diagnosis: large atrial septal defect and marked aortic coarctation at the
isthmus region, adjacent to the left subclavian artery, without ascending aortic
dilatation, with no myocardial hypertrophy and with exuberant collateral
circulation.</p>
      <p>Clinical reasoning: the clinical elements of aortic coarctation and ASD are easily
identifiable, represented by contrast of pulses and blood pressure between limbs in
the first abnormality, and in the second, high murmur at the LSB, right
bundle-branch block and increased pulmonary vasculature. It is evident that, even in
heart disease with long-term pressure overload, there is no myocardial hypertrophy,
or signs of electrical overload and with few symptoms. These aspects originate from
the evolutionary development of efficient collateral circulation.</p>
      <p>Differential Diagnosis: the association of the two defects is unusual, making
clinical reasoning difficult, even though the abovementioned elements are indicative
of the defects. Aortic obstruction in an adult patient, in general, also result from
prior aortitis, as seen in Takayasu's disease, Kawasaki, in connective tissue
diseases and infectious diseases such as syphilis.</p>
      <p>Conduct: Considering the long-standing systolic effects of arterial hypertension,
even without myocardial hypertrophy, surgical indication is mandatory, aimed at
relieving arterial obstruction, which leads to the onset of myocardial fibrosis,
heart failure, arrhythmias and early death. It was decided to perform dilation of
the isthmus region through interventional catheterization from the right femoral
artery using a 40 x 15 mm stent, encompassing the left subclavian artery origin. The
pressures before the procedure, were 30/12 in the RV; in the PT, 30/15-20; ascending
aorta, 140/ 80-100; descending aorta, 90/60-70. There was immediate BP normalization
and equalization in the ascending and descending aorta (128/88-101 mmHg) after
adequate dilation of the region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). The
patient reported easier breathing and well-being. The systolic murmur of the
relative pulmonary stenosis decreased in intensity after the subsequent ASD closure
using a 36 CERA(tm) device.</p>
      <p>Comments: aortic coarctation can manifest later in life, in adulthood, in view of the
collateral circulation development that supplies the descending aorta, therefore
lowering blood pressure in the upper limbs and preventing progression to myocardial
hypertrophy. Similarly, the atrial septal defect, being an abnormality with right
cavity volume overload, becomes so tolerable that the discovery of the disorder in
adulthood becomes even incidental, even after uncomplicated pregnancies.</p>
      <p>The association of these defects is unusual and develops independently without
significant interference from each other. The percutaneous therapeutic approach has
become a reality to the point that, in this patient, it was enthusiastically
performed in spite of the blind-end aortic coarctation contiguous to the left
subclavian artery. The simultaneity of the percutaneous procedures has been scarcely
reported in the literature.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> This
case exemplifies a successful simultaneous percutaneous procedure.</p>
