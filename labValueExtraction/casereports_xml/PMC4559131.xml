  <body>
    <p><bold>Clinical data</bold>: The patient underwent correction of congenital pulmonary and
aortic valve stenosis, both with manifestations, at 7 years of age. Afterwards, there was
progressive residual lesion of both valves, with predominance of regurgitation, and
development of acute arrhythmias such as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, in addition to
ventricular extrasystoles. The obstructions were significant, with pressure gradients of
90&#xA0;and 60 mmHg in the pulmonary and aortic valves, respectively. The patient was
asymptomatic, and the loud systolic murmur was accompanied by thrill all over the
precordium and neck vessels. There was right ventricular overload on the electrocardiogram
(ECG). Double valvoplasty in the three-leaflet valves resulted in a good anatomical
solution initially. To date, the patient reports shortness of breath on moderate exertion
and precordial palpitations. He is on antiarrhythmic drug (amiodarone), after atrial
fibrillation was controlled.</p>
    <p><bold>Physical examination</bold>: Good general state of health, normal breathing,
acyanotic, normal pulses. Weight: 77 kg; height: 181 cm; blood pressure (BP): 110/70 mmHg;
and heart rate (HR): 51 bpm. The aorta (Ao) was moderately palpable on the suprasternal
notch.</p>
    <p>The apical impulse was not palpable on the precordium, and there were mild systolic
impulses on the left sternal border. Heart sounds were normal, and there was a grade 1-2/4
coarse systolic murmur in the pulmonic and aortic areas, and a grade 1-2/4 coarse diastolic
murmur along the left sternal border. The liver was not palpable and the lungs were clear
to auscultation.</p>

      <title>Laboratory tests:</title>
      <p><bold>Electrocardiogram</bold> showed normal sinus rhythm and signs of left anterior
hemiblock, with no chamber overload, and normal ventricular repolarization. PA: +20&#xBA;,
QRSA: -60&#xBA;, TA: +40&#xBA;. QRS complex duration was 0.11", PR = 0.16" and QTc = 0.45" (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

      <p><bold>Chest radiograph</bold> showed moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette due to
enlarged atrial and ventricular arches; the pulmonary vascular network was normal.
Cardiomegaly progressed since the surgical correction, and the current cardiothoracic
ratio was 0.58 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
      <p><bold>Echocardiogram </bold>showed dilated right and left cardiac chambers (right
ventricle &#x2212; RV = 35, left atrium &#x2212; LA = 46; left ventricle &#x2212; LV = 64; Ao = 31 mm); RV
ejection fraction (RVEF) of 53% (Simpson&#x2019;s method); LV ejection fraction (LVEF) of 58%;
RV- pulmonary trunk (PT) pressure gradient of 14 mmHg; LV - Ao pressure gradient of 15
mmHg; and severe pulmonary and aortic regurgitation. The pulmonary systolic pressure was
40 mmHg. Ascending aorta and PT dilatation (40-mm diameter).</p>
      <p><bold>Magnetic resonance imaging</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>)
also showed enlargement of right and left cardiac chambers with preserved ventricular
function. RV end-diastolic volume of 200 mL/m<sup>2,</sup> LV end-diastolic volume of
211 mL/m<sup>2</sup>, RVEF of 54% and LVEF of 58%. Ascending aorta of 45 mm, and PT of
36 mm.</p>

      <p><bold>24-hour dynamic ECG (Holter monitoring)</bold> showed 627 ventricular
extrasystoles and 121 supraventricular extrasystoles. Two episodes of non-sustained
ventricular tachycardia with 6 complexes and two of atrial tachycardia with 16
complexes.</p>
      <p><bold>Clinical diagnosis:</bold> Double pulmonary and aortic valve lesion with
manifestations, showing signs of progressive dilatation of both ventricles, in late
course after surgical correction in childhood.</p>
      <p><bold>Clinical reasoning: </bold>during the course of the disease, the clinical elements
were consistent with the diagnosis of double pulmonary and aortic valve lesion, with
predominance of the first. Shortness of breath and development of ventricular
arrhythmias and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation are related to the residual lesions,
which progressively increased since childhood. Noteworthy, despite the evident
biventricular dilatation, no electrical overload of these chambers was observed. Perhaps
both ventricular dilatations had electrically counterbalanced one another.</p>
      <p><bold>Differential diagnosis:</bold> Concomitant lesion of both semilunar valves as
congenital defects is usually associated with some genetic syndrome, which was not the
case. Residual lesions of both valves commonly occur after correction of obstructive
defects alone or in association, as occurs in the tetralogy of Fallot.</p>
      <p><bold>Management:</bold> in view of the progression of the residual defects with
excessive dilatation of both ventricles, although with biventricular function still
preserved, a surgical approach was chosen with valve replacement for a mechanical
prosthetic valve in the aortic position and for a biological prosthetic valve in the
pulmonary position. Because of the ascending aorta dilatation, a dacron tube was
inserted inside the vessel.</p>
      <p><bold>Commentaries: </bold>residual valve regurgitation after surgical or percutaneous
valvotomy, whether pulmonary or aortic, has become a common outcome that requires the
performance of other operative techniques, such as Ross&#x2019; technique. It is estimated that
approximately 30% of these patients undergoing heart valve correction require surgical
reintervention to prevent further progression of the heart valve defects, which
ultimately result in ventricular dilatation and dysfunction.</p>
      <p>The reintervention usually implies the need for valve replacement. The values currently
recommended to prevent further deterioration of the ventricular function are 120
mL/m<sup>2</sup> for the end-diastolic volume and of 90 mL/m<sup>2</sup> for the
end-systolic volume. In practice, however, we have observed much higher values until
surgical reintervention is indicated, as incidentally occurred in the present case.
Ideally, these patients should be duly monitored, in order to follow the parameters
recommended for a more favorable outcome in the long term.</p>
