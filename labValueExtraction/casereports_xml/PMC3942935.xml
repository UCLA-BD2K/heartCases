        <p>A locally bred, 12-year-old, intact female Satsuma dog presented with generalized
alopecia. Erythema, crusts and desquamation were observed primarily on the truck. Papules
and erosions were present in the pinnae, and there were multiple areas of skin necrosis on
the right forelimb. The cutaneous lesions had not responded to treatment with systemic
antibiotics and prednisolone. The dog also had progressive anemia. <italic>Babesia
gibsoni</italic> was detected in the blood, and the dog was treated with antiprotozoal
agents. The skin lesions and anemia improved, but relapsed after the treatment was
discontinued. Histopathological examination of skin biopsies revealed findings suggestive
of early leukocytoclastic vasculitis or ischemic vasculopathy.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Cutaneous vasculitis is a pathological condition resulting from inflammation of the vascular
wall and perivascular connective tissue. Cutaneous vasculitis can be primary, but usually
occurs secondary to infection, neoplasia, immune-mediated disease or adverse response to drugs
[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. There are a few reports that describe the
pathologic features of multifocal necrotizing arteritis associated with babesiosis in dogs
[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but there are no detailed histopathological
reports in the literature of cutaneous vasculitis associated with Babesia infection. In this
report, we describe the clinical symptoms and the histopathological features of skin lesions
in a dog infected with <italic>Babesia gibsoni.</italic></p>
    <p>A locally bred, 12-year-old, intact female Satsuma dog was referred to the Kagoshima
University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for evaluation of skin lesions. The owner reported
that the dog&#x2019;s weight had decreased from 13 kg to 9.5 kg. Cutaneous symptoms had begun 2
months prior to presentation with papules, alopecia and mild pruritus of the pinnae and
muzzle. These gradually spread from the face to the neck and abdomen and finally to the whole
body. The dog had been treated with prednisolone (2 mg/kg/day) and cephalexin (25 mg/kg twice
daily) for approximately 1 month, but did not respond to the treatment. The owner stopped all
medications a few days before the first visit to our hospital.</p>
    <p>On physical examination, the dog was underweight with a body temperature of 38.0&#xB0;C and
slightly pale mucous membranes. There was generalized alopecia, and the remaining hairs on the
back were easily epilated with mild traction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.
1A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>A&#x2013;D: Appearance of the dog on initial presentation. A: Alopecia, scales and
desquamation in the lumbar area. B: Alopecia and erythema on the trunk. C: Erosion and
crusts in the pinnae. D: Cutaneous necrosis on the right forelimb. E, F: Appearance
during remission after approximately 2 months of antiprotozoal therapy. E: Alopecia and
other skin lesions on the trunk are improved, and the hair color changed from light
brown to dark brown. F: Erosion and crusts disappear in the pinnae.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-75-1367-g001"/></fig>). Mild erythema, crusts and desquamation were observed, primarily on the trunk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">1B</xref>). Alopecia, papules, erosions and crusts
were found in the pinnae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Multiple
pruritic areas of cutaneous necrosis were present on the cranial aspect of the right forelimb
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1D</xref>). There were also erosions on the cranial
aspect of the left forelimb. Repeated skin scrapings were negative for ectoparasites and
fungal elements. Direct impression smears prepared from the trunk and pinnae revealed neither
bacterial infection nor <italic>Malassezia</italic> overgrowth.</p>
    <p>A complete blood count revealed leukocytosis (32.2 &#xD7; 10<sup>3</sup>/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>) with
neutrophilia and regenerative anemia (red blood cells 2.59 &#xD7;
10<sup>6</sup>/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>, hematocrit 21%, hemoglobin 5.9 g/d<italic>l</italic>,
mean cell volume 74.9 fl and mean cell hemoglobin concentration 30.4 g/d<italic>l</italic>)
with polychromasia and anisocytosis. No intraerythrocytic parasites were detected in the blood
smear. The Coombs&#x2019; test was not conducted, because the dog had been receiving prednisolone.
Hematuria and hemoglobinuria were not reported. Platelet count was within the normal range
(284 &#xD7; 10<sup>3</sup>/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>). Serum chemistry analysis revealed slightly
elevated concentrations of alkaline phosphatase (260 U/<italic>l</italic>) and blood urea
nitrogen (38.3 mg/d<italic>l</italic>). C-reactive protein (0.65 mg/d<italic>l</italic>) was
within the normal range. Since the clinical signs did not suggest Cushing&#x2019;s syndrome or
hypothyroidism, the serum concentrations of thyroid hormone and cortisol were not determined.
Abdominal ultrasound findings were normal, except for enlarged, hypoechoic ovaries.</p>
    <p>Although a definitive diagnosis was not yet established, we suspected based on the skin
lesions, and the polychromatic erythrocytes and anisocytosis, that this dog had an
immune-mediated skin disease with concurrent immune-mediated hemolytic anemia. We restarted
the prednisolone and cephalexin prescribed by the previous veterinarian (prednisolone 2
mg/kg/day and cephalexin 25 mg/kg twice daily). We also prescribed digestive enzymes and an
adequate amount of food to improve malnutrition, because the dog had lost weight in spite of a
good appetite,</p>
    <p>The dog gained weight 7 days after the first visit. Trypsin-like-immunoactivity was within
the normal range (29.9 <italic>n</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic>; reference 9.2&#x2013;46.3
<italic>n</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic>), and iron-deficiency anemia was ruled out by a high
serum iron value (322 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/d<italic>l</italic>; reference 50&#x2013;173
<italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/d<italic>l</italic>). However, at a second examination 14 days after the
first visit, the clinical signs had considerably worsened. The alopecia continued to spread
over the whole body, the region of necrosis on the right forelimb had worsened, the anemia had
progressed (red blood cells 1.45 &#xD7; 10<sup>6</sup>/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>, hematocrit 16% and
hemoglobin 4.0 g/d<italic>l</italic>), and the platelet count had markedly decreased (57 &#xD7;
10<sup>3</sup>/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>). At this time, Babesia-like organisms were found on a
blood smear. <italic>B. gibsoni</italic> was detected in a peripheral blood sample by
polymerase chain reaction [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, we made a tentative diagnosis of babesiosis. A blood transfusion
was performed, and the prednisolone dose was tapered. Atovaquon (13.3 mg/kg PO three times
daily) and azithromycin (10 mg/kg PO once daily) were given for 9 days [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], after which the treatment was changed to a combination therapy
(clindamycin 25 mg/kg PO twice daily, doxycycline 5 mg/kg PO twice daily and metronidazole 25
mg/kg PO twice daily) as described previously [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
    <p>Twenty-one days after beginning the antiprotozoal treatment, the anemia had improved
(hematocrit 36%), and the platelet count had returned to normal (465 &#xD7;
10<sup>3</sup>/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>). Systemic cutaneous symptoms had also improved
dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">1F</xref>). We stopped the
antiprotozoal medications after approximately 100 days of therapy. Two months later, the
patient relapsed with desquamation and alopecia on the pinnae and forelimbs. Leukocytosis
(43.2 &#xD7; 10<sup>3</sup>/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>) and anemia (red blood cells 448 &#xD7;
10<sup>4</sup>/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic> and hematocrit 29%) also recurred. Babesia-like organisms
were not detected on a blood smear. Platelet count remained within the normal range (354 &#xD7;
10<sup>3</sup>/<italic>&#xB5;l</italic>). C-reactive protein was elevated this time (7.8
mg/d<italic>l</italic>). Skin biopsy samples were collected from areas of erythema and
desquamation on the trunk. Histological examination revealed mild to moderate hyperkeratosis
and epidermal acanthosis, as well as perivascular infiltration of neutrophils with mild edema
and marked extravasation in the upper to middle portion of the dermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Histopathological sections of affected skin. A: Lower magnification showing
perivascular infiltration of inflammatory cells in the middle portion of dermis. Edema
and intense extravasation are seen in the superficial dermis. B: Higher magnification of
A showing infiltration of neutrophils into the vessel walls and perivascular area, and
fibrin deposition adjacent to the blood vessels.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-75-1367-g002"/></fig>). Neutrophilic perivascular infiltration of small vessels, excessive extravasation and
fibrin deposition were also observed in the middle portion of the dermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Fibrinoid degeneration in the vessel walls was not seen in
the histological sections examined. Large vessels in the deep dermis or subcutis were not
affected. Mild perivascular and interstitial infiltrations of eosinophils and lymphocytes were
also observed. Periodic acid-Schiff and gram staining revealed no fungi or bacteria. No mite
infestation was detected. These histopathologic findings suggested an early leukocytoclastic
vasculitis or ischemic vasculopathy. Based on the clinicopathologic and histopathologic
findings, we made the diagnosis of cutaneous vasculitis associated with babesiosis and
restarted antiprotozoal treatment with clindamycin (25 mg/kg PO twice daily) and doxycycline
(5 mg/kg PO twice daily). Metronidazole was not administered, because of owner non-compliance.
The dog&#x2019;s skin condition again improved.</p>
    <p>Gross cutaneous lesions that have been reported in dogs infected with
<italic>B.canis</italic> include cutaneous hemorrhagic macules, urticaria and necrosis of
the extremities (as was also present in this case) [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].
The systemic alopecia, desquamation, papules, crusts and scales seen in this case have not
been previously reported. Cutaneous vasculitis associated with babesiosis is thought to be
mediated by immune complexes, which adhere to blood vessel walls and activate inflammatory
cells. The activated inflammatory cells then release free radicals or histamine, which promote
inflammatory cell infiltration and vascular permeability. These reactions eventually damage
the perivascular tissue [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the previous report
[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], skin biopsies were taken from only two dogs, and
histopathological examination revealed a mixed perivascular inflammatory infiltrate in one
case. Skin biopsy was not performed on initial presentation in this case, but histopathologic
findings during the relapse suggested early leukocytoclastic vasculitis or ischemic
vasculopathy, in which marked fibrinoid degeneration of the vessel walls may not be prominent.
There were no histopathologic findings indicative of endocrine alopecia. In this patient, the
alopecia was thought to be associated with ischemic changes in the skin. Improvement of skin
lesions coincided with remission of the babesiosis during treatment with antiprotozoal agents,
and the relapse and improvement after stopping and restarting the medication also suggest that
the skin lesions were associated with babesiosis. To date, the course of treatment for
cutaneous babesiosis has not been reported. In a case of suspected cutaneous
vasculitis/vasculopathy, one should consider chronic babesiosis as a differential diagnosis in
endemic areas.</p>
