    <p>Encephalitis is characterized by inflammation in the brain parenchyma associated with clinical evidence of brain dysfunction [<xref rid="CIU940C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIU940C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The majority of encephalitis cases are thought to be viral in origin; however, in up to 63% of cases a causative agent is not found [<xref rid="CIU940C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Cases with unknown etiology pose difficulties in patient management, particularly when a patient is immunosuppressed, because the treatment for infectious and noninfectious cases differs greatly, with the latter sometimes requiring additional immunosuppression, which can be detrimental if a pathogen is present.</p>
    <p>To investigate a case of encephalopathy in an immunosuppressed 18-month-old boy for which no cause could be found by traditional techniques, we applied RNA sequencing technologies to a brain biopsy. Deep sequencing of the transcriptome has previously been used to identify viral flora and disease-associated pathogens in human tissues [<xref rid="CIU940C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="CIU940C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A key feature of this methodology is that it does not make prior assumptions about the type of pathogen, but has the potential to detect RNA from all species.</p>
    <p>Here we describe the use of this strategy in a routine diagnostic setting to identify astrovirus (AstV) of the VA1 and human-mink-ovine&#x2013;like (HMO)-C subgroup as the likely causative agent in this case. The result, which was obtained within 6 days of brain biopsy, informed subsequent patient management. To investigate further the need for routine diagnostic testing for VA1/HMO-C viruses, we screened 680 samples of stool and 349 of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from undiagnosed cases of diarrhea and encephalitis, respectively. Our data underline the clinical significance of VA1/HMO-C AstV as a clinically significant pathogen in immunocompromised patients.</p>

        <title>Patient and Samples</title>
        <p>Patient A, an 18-month-old boy with cartilage hair hypoplasia and associated immunodeficiency due to <italic>RMRP</italic> mutations, underwent a peripheral blood stem cell transplant on 28 March 2013 from a 10/10 human leukocyte antigen&#x2013;matched unrelated donor following conditioning with fludarabine (150 mg/m<sup>2</sup> over 5 days), melphalan (140 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day &#x2013;2), and alemtuzumab (1 mg/kg over 5 days) for in vivo T-cell depletion. Ciclosporin A and mycophenolate mofetil were given as graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis.</p>
        <p>Transplant was uncomplicated with neutrophil engraftment achieved by day 13. Persistent stool viruses (sapovirus, adenovirus) were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Adenoviremia occurred from day 18 onward with peak load of 201 697 copies/mL on day 21. This required treatment with cidofovir (5 mg/kg 1 dose) and donor-derived adenovirus-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (1 &#xD7; 10<sup>4</sup>/kg total CD3<sup>+</sup> cells) on day 28. Adenovirus load declined to 820 copies/mL 12 days after infusion (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cid/ciu940/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>). Two weeks later, the child became acutely unwell with irritability, dystonia, and reduced consciousness. Encephalopathy secondary to drug toxicity, infectious complications, or inflammation associated with immune reconstitution were considered in the differential diagnosis. Ciclosporin was stopped on day 43 and replaced by methylprednisolone therapy (1 mg/kg).</p>
        <p>Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed progressive changes with loss of volume (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cid/ciu940/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>), and electroencephalography revealed increased amplitudes of ongoing slow activity over posterior regions with no focal features or epileptiform abnormalities. PCR of CSF 2 days, 2 weeks, and 1 month after onset of symptoms did not detect adenovirus, herpes simplex virus type 1 or 2, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, BK virus, norovirus, sapovirus, astrovirus (HAstV 1&#x2013;8), rotavirus, enterovirus, measles, parechovirus, JC virus, human herpesvirus type 6 or 7, or <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. Brain biopsy performed 8 weeks after neurological deterioration was also negative for these pathogens as well as 18S (fungal) and 16S (bacterial) ribosomal RNA gene PCR assays. Histological examination of the brain (described below) showed an unusual pattern of pathology, but the differential diagnosis included encephalitis of infectious etiology. Withdrawal of immunosuppression was associated with the development of skin GVHD (grade 2, stage 3) requiring methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day). As a result, kinetics of T-cell reconstitution were reduced with a CD3 count of 0.35 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L at 6 months, and in the context of ongoing neurological impairment with recurrent respiratory and gastrointestinal complications, the patient died 9 months after transplant.</p>

        <title>Deep Sequencing</title>
        <p>Total RNA was purified from a fresh brain biopsy and polyA RNA separated for sequencing library preparation. Rapid RNA-Seq was performed on an Illumina Miseq. Nonhost data, assembled into contigs, and remaining nonassembled reads that showed only partial homology to protein database sequences using BLASTx were analyzed using a Bayesian mixture model [<xref rid="CIU940C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] to obtain a concise summary of the species present in the mixture. This approach overcomes the limitation of existing methods for analysis of short read data, which are not designed to detect pathogens at low levels. In this context, we use a Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) strategy to identify the subset of species that best explains the data. Multiple MCMC chains are run in parallel using a population MCMC strategy to speed up convergence. Each potential species is then assigned a posterior probability that quantifies the support for the presence of this infectious agent.</p>

        <title>Pan-Astrovirus PCR and Sequencing</title>
        <p>To confirm the presence of AstV in the brain biopsy, a pan-astrovirus heminested PCR assay was carried out as described previously [<xref rid="CIU940C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
        <p>PCR products were capillary sequenced using BigDye 3.1 (Life Technologies) and an ABI 3130. Sequencing data was visualized and analyzed with SeqMan Pro version 11.1 (DNA Star). The consensus sequence was checked for similarity to known AstV sequences using BLASTn [<xref rid="CIU940C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>

        <title>Real-time Reverse Transcription PCR</title>
        <p>Contig sequences generated from deep sequencing were used to design a real-time reverse transcription PCR assay specific to the AstV identified in this study, named AstV-contig. Primers are shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cid/ciu940/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>.</p>
        <p>An AstV-contig PCR assay was used to retrospectively test all stored samples for patient A during his hospital admission. These samples were from stool (n = 17), nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) (n = 12), urine (n = 1), sera (n = 2), and CSF (n = 3).</p>
        <p>To investigate the possible source of infection, all stored specimens from patients on the same ward as patient A, which were collected from 2 weeks before to 2 weeks after patient A's first positive AstV-contig PCR result, were tested by the AstV-contig PCR assay. This included 18 samples (14 stool and 4 urine) from 9 patients. For patient B, who had a single positive stool sample, an additional 14 stools, 23 NPAs, and 3 sera were tested by the AstV-contig PCR.</p>

        <title>Genome Sequencing</title>
        <p>Twelve tiled primer sets were designed to cover the full AstV genome. They were designed using the full genome sequences for AstV-VA1 and -SG and partial sequences for HMO-C (genbank accession numbers FJ973620, GQ891990, GQ415662, GQ441191, GQ441192), as these showed 95%&#x2013;98% identity with the pan-astrovirus PCR product from the brain biopsy.

        <p>Clustal W was used to align a 432 nucleotide region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and 2460 nucleotide region of the capsid gene with 39 other AstV sequences. Sequences included representatives of the classical human astroviruses HAstV1&#x2013;8, bat, mink, ovine, and, to our knowledge, all of the recently described novel HAstVs MLB-1&#x2013;3, HMO-A&#x2013;C, VA-1&#x2013;4, and -SG. Turkey AstV was used as an outgroup. The aligned regions correspond to nucleotides 3432&#x2013;3864 and 3628&#x2013;4042 for the RdRp alignment and 4382&#x2013;6733 and 4210&#x2013;6486 for the capsid of AstV-SG and HAstV-1, respectively.</p>
        <p>The RdRp phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the neighbor-joining method [<xref rid="CIU940C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] with 1000 bootstrap replicates [<xref rid="CIU940C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The evolutionary distances were computed using the maximum composite likelihood method [<xref rid="CIU940C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and are in units of the number of base substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5 [<xref rid="CIU940C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>

        <p>The RNA-Seq data consisted of 20 588 062 paired-end reads, of which 92% passed quality control (nonrepetitive sequence and average Phred scaled quality score &gt;15) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="CIU940TB1">1</xref>). Reads that could not be assigned to the human genome (77 915 reads, 0.4% of total reads) were potentially of foreign origin. Our mixture model identified 2 viruses with confidence, 1 of which was the phiX bacteriophage (79% of nonhost reads) that was used for quality control of the Illumina high-throughput sequencing. Five assembled contigs (44 reads) and 2 nonassembled reads (therefore 46 reads overall) were assigned to the AstV VA1 sequence (genbank accession number FJ973620) with 97% sequence identity and a probability score of 1. After adding the AstV VA1 and the bacteriophage phiX species in our mixture model, we found no evidence for any additional viruses in the data.

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Encephalopathy occurring in immunodeficient subjects or recipients of stem cell transplants can present a diagnostic dilemma; distinguishing infection from other potential causes such as drug toxicity or GVHD can be difficult. In the case outlined here of encephalitis occurring in an immunosuppressed 18-month-old boy, having excluded common pathogens using conventional methods, we resorted to deep sequencing of brain tissue from which we were able to identify astrovirus, HAstV-VA1/HMO-C-UK1(a). Based on phylogeny, we propose that this virus belongs to the VA1 and HMO-C group of astroviruses. VA1/HMO-C astroviruses are part of a divergent group that is related to Astroviridae found in association with neurological illnesses in mink [<xref rid="CIU940C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and cattle [<xref rid="CIU940C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Our finding represents the second report of an AstV in the VA1/HMO-C group causing fatal encephalitis, which confirms a pathogenic role for this virus group likely to have been previously underrecognized in immunocompromised patients. The first case described, AstV-SG, is phylogenetically close to HAstV-VA1/HMO-C-UK1(a) and was also found by deep sequencing of brain tissue from a 15-year-old boy with X-linked agammaglobulinemia who developed unexplained encephalitis [<xref rid="CIU940C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Two more distantly related viruses in this phylum, HMO-A and -B, were detected in stool from children with nonpolio flaccid paralysis; however, healthy controls were not included in the study, so the clinical significance of HMO-A and -B is unclear. Other related HMO-C viruses have been associated with diarrhea in children living in Nepal [<xref rid="CIU940C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and the United States [<xref rid="CIU940C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], suggesting a global distribution of this virus.</p>
      <p>The neuropathology on brain biopsy was distinctive with frequent neuronal apoptosis associated with a microglial reaction but lacking a significant lymphocytic inflammatory response. Whereas the pattern of microglial reaction raised the possibility of viral encephalitis, the pattern of neuronal cell death would be unusual in most typical viral encephalitides.</p>
      <p>The pattern of both gastrointestinal and neurological infections caused by VA1/HMO-C viruses contrasts with that of conventional human Astroviridae, HAstV 1&#x2013;8, which are primarily associated with gastroenteritis. For HAstV-VA1/HMO-C-UK1(a), RNA in the brain was confirmed by 3 different PCR assays and we were able to generate full-genome sequences using overlapping PCR. The positive immunohistochemistry for the capsid protein provided further confirmation of replication competent virus in the brain. The highest titers of viral RNA were found in the brain tissue, and RNA was consistently detected in the CSF. Significantly lower levels of viral RNA were found in stool and serum (plasma and whole blood were not available), the latter confirming viremic spread. By contrast, 1 case of HAstV-4 has been identified in brain tissue from a patient with severe combined immunodeficiency following a hematopoietic stem cell transplant [<xref rid="CIU940C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; however, this was associated with much higher levels of viral RNA in the stool, significantly lower levels in the brain, and no immunohistochemical evidence of viral proteins in brain, although intestinal staining was positive.</p>
      <p>A cross-sectional community study of diarrhea identified HMO-C viruses in 2% of cases of diarrhea and 1% of controls, compared with 13% of cases due to HAstV [<xref rid="CIU940C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This low prevalence fits with data from our study of 680 stool and 349 CSF samples from all ages that identified only 2 patients (patients B and C), both immunocompromised, with evidence of the virus in the stool. In patient B, the infection may have been transient or even caused by contamination, as the viral load was at the limit of detection of the assay and none of 42 (16 stool, 3 serum, 23 NPA) additional samples from the child were positive. Whole-genome sequencing of the AstV from the second patient, patient C, which we have termed HAstV-VA1/HMO-C-UK1(b), revealed it to be 99.4% similar to patient A's virus, which is phylogenetically closer than has been observed for other co-circulating VA1/HMO-C viruses . The result suggests that transmission may have occurred between patients A and C, although without additional sequences from the United Kingdom this cannot be confirmed. Because infection in patients A and C occurred many months apart and they were never together on the same ward, transmission, if it occurred, is likely to have been indirect. Similar to HAstV 1&#x2013;8, antibodies against HMO-C viruses have been shown to increase with age, reaching a prevalence of 65% in adults in the United States [<xref rid="CIU940C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Taken together, these data suggest that in healthy individuals, VA1/HMO-C AstV infection is common but generally asymptomatic. By contrast, our data support VA1/HMO-C as a neuropathic agent in immunocompromised patients and one that should be looked for in cases of encephalitis.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have used state-of-the-art deep sequencing in a routine diagnostic setting together with PCR and immunohistochemistry to identify AstV VA1/HMO-C as the cause of encephalitis of unknown origin occurring in an immunocompromised child and a possible case of nosocomial spread. We have used deep-sequencing methodologies in a diagnostic setting to identify the causative agent in unknown encephalitis within 6 days of receiving the specimen. The result excluded drug toxicity and immune-mediated inflammation as causes for the clinical picture, and informed a decision to reduce immunosuppression. This case illustrates the utility of deep sequencing in a clinical setting to identify unexpected or novel pathogens.</p>
