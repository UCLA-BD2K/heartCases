<bold>Clinical data:</bold> In the course of life, the patient developed three types of
clinical manifestations. The first one was characterized by dyspnea and tachypnea, from
birth to five months of age, increased pulmonary flow and heart failure, with cardiomegaly
and hepatomegaly. The second phase was characterized by stability without significant
symptoms, which lasted until the age of three, presumptive of balanced aortopulmonary flow.
The third phase, with decreased pulmonary flow, had mild cyanosis that worsened two years
ago. Exertion fatigue was noted for four years ago. The patient maintained saturation above
85% and up to 75% two years ago, hemoglobin = 17 g/dL and hematocrit = 62%.</p>
    <p>
<bold>Physical examination:</bold> Eupneic, cyanotic +++, normal pulses, no jugular venous
distention. Weight: 54 kg; height: 160 cm; BP: 115/60 mmHg; HR: 78 bpm; oxygen saturation =
78%. Aorta was palpated ++ in the suprasternal notch.</p>
    <p>In precordium, apical impulse in the 4<sup>th </sup>right intercostal space and discrete
systolic impulses at the right sternal edge. Second hyperphonetic heart sound, +++, at
pulmonary area, increases toward the lower left sternal edge. Discrete and mild continuous
murmur, +/++, at pulmonary area, irradiating to the back. Liver was not palpated.</p>

      <p>
<bold>Electrocardiogram</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>) showed
junctional rhythm and signs of left ventricular overload on the right. The P wave was
negative in II, III, aVF and precordial areas. The QRS complex morphology was RS in V1,
rs in V6 and Rs in V6R. The T wave was negative in I, L and more positive in V6R than in
V6. AQRS: +160&#xBA;, AT: 120&#xBA;, AP: &#x2212;80&#xBA;.</p>

          <p>Chest radiography shows the heart on the right in situs solitus, with

<bold>Chest radiography </bold>shows normal cardiac silhouette (cardiothoracic ratio =
0.45) on the right in situs solitus (gastric bubble on the left) with rounded right
ventricular arch. The upper arch on the left was long. Normal pulmonary vasculature and
moderate scoliosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>
<bold>Echocardiography</bold> showed heart in dextrocardia and situs solitus. There were
atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial discordances, pulmonary atresia (PA) and large
ventricular septal defect (VSD) in the 25 mm inflow. The pulmonary trunk was not viewed,
neither were pulmonary arteries. The diameters of the cavities were normal and
ventricles were functioning normally.</p>
      <p>
<bold>Catheterization:</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>) In the
second month of life, the pulmonary arteries were hypoplastic and confluent and
irrigated by the ductus arteriosus directed to the right lung and the left upper lobe.
The aortopulmonary collateral vessel of the descending aorta was directed to the left
lower lobe. A new examination showed left upper vase as an aortopulmonary collateral
vessel instead of the ductus arteriosus. The left pulmonary artery was 8 mm in diameter;
the right was 13 mm in diameter with left stenosis (diameter = 5 mm). The pressure along
the pulmonary circuit were systemic (100/64 mmHg).</p>

        <caption>
          <p>Angiography of aortopulmonary circulation emphasizes the anatomic aspects
described. The pulmonary arteries are opacified by left upper aortopulmonary
vessel (A and B) and another aortopulmonary collateral vessel to the left lower
lobe (D). The left pulmonary artery shows clear stenosis (A and B) and is smaller
than the right, which is directed to the entire right lung (C).</p>

      <p>
<bold>Clinical diagnosis: </bold>Corrected transposition of the great arteries (CTGA),
pulmonary atresia and ventricular septal defect in dextrocardia and situs solitus.
Pulmonary circulation is nourished by aortopulmonary collateral arteries with pulmonary
arterial hypertension in severe hypoxia and natural evolution.</p>
      <p>
<bold>Clinical reasoning: </bold>Clinical findings of cyanogenic heart diseases,
accompanied by PA + VSD may vary, often with signs of overflow, balancing flows or
decreased pulmonary blood flow, as noted in this patient under natural evolution. The
initial overflow gave way others due to predominance of decreased pulmonary blood flow.
In this patient, the last stage was due to increased pulmonary arterial hypertension,
not diagnosed initially. Other clinical signs were indicative of CTGA: second heart
sound in the pulmonary area, which increases to the lower right sternal edge, suggesting
that the aorta arises from the right ventricle to the left, backed by radiographic
imaging, in which the ascending aorta is located on the left. The continuous murmur of
collateral arteries expresses the presumed associated pulmonary atresia. The left
ventricle is located on the right, directing the T wave to the right and systolic and
diastolic overload of this ventricle.</p>
      <p>
<bold>Differential diagnosis:</bold> Heart diseases of type VSD + PA are externalized in
the same manner, and the base diagnosis of other anomalies must be performed based on
other clinical guiding elements, as demonstrated in this case.</p>
      <p>
<bold>Conduct:</bold> In view of the marked reactive pulmonary hypertension, sildenafil
was introduced at a dose of 25 mg every 8 hours. There was improvement in physical
tolerance and arterial saturation rose to 85%.</p>
      <p>
<bold>Comments:</bold> This rare association, PA + VSD + CTGA and pulmonary circulation
dependent on aortopulmonary collateral arteries was reported only once in the
literature<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>In general, the clinical picture depends on two defects (VSD + PA) guiding the
pathophysiology of this set. When the collateral circulation is augmented with increased
pulmonary flow, it generally undergoes stabilization and subsequent decrease,
characterizing the evolutionary stages. Hypoxemia arises from decreased pulmonary flow
through stenosis of aortopulmonary circulation or the development of pulmonary
hypertension. In both situations, this picture naturally evolves to the second or third
decade of life. Because of this, indication for surgery in this patient and other
similar patients should always be questioned, counterbalancing clinical evolutionary
aspects, post-operative conditions and surgical risk.</p>
