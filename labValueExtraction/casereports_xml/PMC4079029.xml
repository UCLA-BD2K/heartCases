      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>"Torsades de pointes" (TdP) ventricular tachycardias carry a high risk of sudden
death, even when they occur in individuals with a structurally normal heart, in the
absence of myocardial ischemia or prolonged QT interval. Leenhardt et al<sup><xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> described a new syndrome with these
characteristics in 1994 that showed a difference in which the TdP were triggered by
ventricular extrasystoles (VE) with ultra-short coupling interval (&lt; 300 ms).</p>
      <p>Although this condition is easily diagnosed by the described characteristics, there
is a lack of data on the clinical management of patients during the phase of
electrical storm and during long-term clinical outcome. Over the past 20 years,
three patients were identified in our institution with this clinical condition, as
well as a family member with VE and short coupling interval, asymptomatic and
without documented polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT).</p>
      <p>The aim of this case report is to describe the clinical management used in these
patients and review the literature on the implication of the finding of VE with
short coupling interval in asymptomatic family members.</p>

      <title>Case Reports</title>
      <sec>
        <title>Case 1</title>
        <p>Female patient, 20 years of age, started to have rhythmic palpitations, initially
well tolerated and self-limited in August 1993, at the same time when she had
depression due to the loss of a family member. In the same month she had an
episode of loss of consciousness with sphincter release that lasted
approximately 10 minutes, followed by spontaneous recovery with no physical
trauma. During the evolution, she started to have several episodes of
short-duration palpitations. Three months later, she reported a new episode of
convulsive syncope lasting approximately 8 minutes, after which hospitalization
was indicated for investigation. On the same night she was hospitalized, she had
an episode of cardiac arrest in ventricular fibrillation rhythm, and underwent
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The investigation showed no evidence of
structural heart disease; cardiac chamber showed preserved dimensions (LV =
47/29 mm, LVEF = 76 %; Aorta = 29 mm; LA = 27 mm, RV = 20 mm; septum and
posterior wall = 8 mm each and preserved biventricular function, no segmental
contractility alterations and no valvular dysfunction).</p>
        <p>The 24-hour Holter showed VE with ultra-short coupling interval (260 ms) inducing
episodes of non-sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>. The 12-lead electrocardiogram
showed no alterations, the QT interval was 360 ms and QTc was 390 ms. The
exercise stress test was negative for myocardial ischemia with no arrhythmia at
rest or upon exertion. Coronary angiography was normal. The high-resolution
electrocardiogram showed no late potentials. We performed an
electrophysiological study (EPS), which showed normal basic intervals and did
not induce arrhythmias when programmed ventricular stimulation was performed in
the apex and right ventricular outflow tract, as well as using
'short-long-short' cycles for induction of VT/VF during sensitization with
isoproterenol. The patient started to receive verapamil 80 mg every 8 hours and
received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).</p>

        <p>The patient needed psychological counseling after these events. During follow-up,
she still had episodes of non-sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia,
seen at the 24-hour Holter, requiring a dose of 480 mg/day of verapamil to
control the arrhythmia. She then remained asymptomatic for several years,
although the 24-hour Holter still showed VE with short-coupling interval (260
ms). Seventeen years after the diagnosis and two ICD generator replacements, the
patient received adequate defibrillator therapy; during an evaluation, she
reported poor compliance to treatment with calcium channel blockers. At
follow-up, she showed no significant emotional alterations, ischemic changes or
ventricular function worsening.</p>

        <title>Case 2</title>
        <p>Female patient, 52 years old, admitted at another service due to episodes of
recurrent syncope in 2010. At the time, she had suffered the recent loss of a
son in a car accident and was drinking a type of "tea for weight loss." The
electrocardiographic monitoring showed episodes of rapid ventricular tachycardia
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">2B</xref>). Within hours, the patient developed electrical storm
and needed defibrillation for more than 50 times during a 24-hour period,
requiring sedation and orotracheal intubation. An attempt was made to suppress
the arrhythmias with isoproterenol, which was not successful.</p>

        <p>Recurrence was observed in less than 6 hours after the start of drug infusion. A
temporary pacemaker was implanted in the right ventricle, performed on
stimulation without arrhythmia suppression. She was clinically stable after 48
hours of deep sedation and administration of verapamil at a dose of 240
mg/day.</p>
        <p>The investigation showed no structural heart disease at the echocardiography, MRI
and coronary angiography. The 24-h Holter monitoring, performed after crisis
stabilization, showed 960 VE/24 h, with several of them showing short coupling
(+/- 280 ms) and the same morphology. There were no tachycardias. At the ECG,
the QTc was 400 ms. Electrophysiological mapping and attempted VE ablation were
not successful. The scarcity of extrasystoles during the procedure did not
induce arrhythmias when programmed ventricular stimulation was performed in the
apex and right ventricular outflow tract, as well as using 'short-long-short'
cycles for of VT/ VF induction under sensitization with isoproterenol. ICD
implantation was indicated and treatment with verapamil was maintained. The
patient remains asymptomatic during the two-year follow-up.</p>

        <title>Case 3</title>
        <p>This is an asymptomatic, 18-year-old woman, the daughter of the patient described
in case # 2. During family screening, she was diagnosed with VE with a coupling
of approximately 300 ms (17 extrasystoles in 24 h) during a 24-h Holter
monitoring. Because the patient was asymptomatic and due to the low-density VE,
it was decided to prescribe verapamil 160 mg/day and keep her on frequent
clinical monitoring. She remains asymptomatic after a follow-up period of 48
months.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Case 4</title>
        <p>Female patient, 39 years old, with episodes of syncope preceded by sudden and
fast malaise, without trauma and unrelated to exertion, some occurring at night,
during sleep, at an approximate frequency of three times a week since March
2011. She sought medical attention a few times, having been diagnosed with
anxiety and prescribed anxiolytics, with no improvement of symptoms and
worsening of anxiety. On 07/10/2011, she had recurrence of syncope, with
characteristics similar to those described, when she was admitted at another
hospital for diagnosis.</p>
        <p>The patient had no family history of cardiac arrhythmias or sudden death.
Physical examination was normal. The initial ECG showed no abnormalities. The
exercise stress test was negative for ischemia and di not trigger arrhythmias.
The echocardiogram showed a structurally normal heart (LV = 52/35 mm, LVEF =
60%; Aorta = 33 mm; LA = 35 mm; septum and posterior wall = 9 mm; preserved
biventricular function, no segmental alterations in contractility and mitral
valve prolapse with discrete meso-systolic leak). Cardiac magnetic resonance
imaging also ruled out structural heart disease showing preserved cardiac
chamber dimensions with normal biventricular function (LVEF = 70% and RVEF =
69%), without the presence of myocardial fibrosis.</p>
        <p>The Holter monitoring showed several polymorphic VE with short-coupling interval,
some of them inducing nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia initiated
by extrasystoles with R-on-T phenomenon, with coupling between 350 and 370 ms,
and QT intervals within normal limits.</p>
        <p>The coronary angiography ruled out the presence of obstructive coronary artery
disease. She was prescribed diltiazem 180 mg/day and a defibrillator implant was
indicated, performed in August 2011. As the VE persisted (density 2%) with
episodes of non-sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, diltiazem was
substituted by verapamil 240 mg/day in September 2011. New 24-h Holter
monitoring showed a significant reduction in the density of arrhythmias
(&lt;1%), increase in minimum coupling interval of extrasystoles to 370 ms and
absence of episodes of non-sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, always
with a normal QT interval. The patient became asymptomatic, with no further
episodes of syncope or ICD therapies, during a nine-month follow up.</p>

    <sec sec-type="discussion">
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Described by Dessertenne<sup><xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> in 1966,
TdP ventricular has a typical ECG pattern, with progressive changes in morphology,
amplitude and polarity of the QRS complex of which peaks cross the baseline before
spontaneously terminating. This phenomenon is preceded by a long-short cycle that
triggers the tachycardia, usually after a long coupling interval (600 to 800 ms).
The scenario of this arrhythmia includes long QT syndrome in its congenital and
acquired forms, as well as the precipitating factors, such as electrolyte
disturbances.</p>
      <p>Three decades later, in 1994, Leenhardt et al<sup><xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> published a series of 14 patients without structural heart
disease and a history of syncope, whose electrocardiographic monitoring showed TdP
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with normal QT intervals, initiated by VE with
short coupling interval (200 - 300 ms). One third of these patients had a family
history of sudden death, and approximately 70% had TdP degenerating into ventricular
fibrillation during a mean follow-up of seven years. The morphology of isolated VE
and those that initiated the TdP was similar in nine patients, with most triggering
VE showing left bundle branch block morphology and axis deviated to the left.</p>
      <p>In general, the EPS did not reproduce the clinical arrhythmia. The only drug that
partially suppressed arrhythmia was verapamil, increasing the VE coupling interval
and reducing its density. However, it was not able to prevent sudden death, which is
why the ICD is indicated for all patients with this disease.</p>
      <p>In the following year, a series of 15 patients with the same characteristics (absence
of structural heart disease, normal QT interval) that had episodes of TdP
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia initiated by VE with short coupling interval was
published. It was demonstrated that the smaller the coupling interval of these
extrasystoles, the greater the risk of spontaneous polymorphic ventricular
tachycardia, and, therefore, of sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation. No
medication was able to prevent this outcome<sup><xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>In the two largest case series published, similar to our three patients, we observed
that the initial clinical presentation was syncope preceded or not by palpitations
and the occurrence was predominantly in females. The age of symptom onset ranged
from the second to the fifth decade of life and two of our patients were going
through major psychological problems, which is described as a potential trigger for
the clinical manifestation of the disease<sup><xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The mean coupling interval measured from the beginning of
the QRS preceding the extrasystole, at the beginning of the latter, was + / - 280
ms. Verapamil has been prescribed to all patients, although the literature reports
the frequent occurrence of appropriate ICD therapy and sudden death, in which the
defibrillator had not been implanted, despite medication use<sup><xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>A case of electrical storm and recovered cardiac arrest triggered by VE with
ultrashort coupling interval in a 50-year-old patient was recently published.
Similar to our patient in case number 2, there were several episodes of spontaneous
TdP polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, some of them developing into ventricular
fibrillation requiring cardiorespiratory resuscitation and electrical
defibrillation.</p>
      <p>Several intravenous medications have been tried, including lidocaine, amiodarone and
magnesium, without control of arrhythmia. Ventricular pacing with temporary
pacemaker electrode resulted in arrhythmia exacerbation. However, unlike our
patient, the infusion of isoproterenol until a heart rate of 100 bpm is achieved
showed to be capable of suppressing ventricular arrhythmias. Electrode implantation
in the right atrium and its stimulation at a frequency of 85 bpm was effective in
arrhythmia remission. After ICD implantation with atrial pacing of 85 bpm, the
patient had no symptoms and no evidence of arrhythmias during a three-month
follow-up<sup><xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>There is no consensus in the literature regarding what the normal value of the VE
coupling interval is. In the patient from case number 4, the shortest coupling
interval recorded was 360 ms, with several episodes of NSVT occurring with VE of up
to 370 ms, with morphological characteristics similar to those from the other three
cases. A clinical hypothesis is that it is the same genetic mutation with varying
degrees of gene penetration and consequently, different clinical expressions.
Therefore, individuals with the more severe form of disease could potentially
trigger malignant arrhythmias without necessarily having a coupling interval &lt;
300 ms.</p>
      <p>In 2002, Haissaguerre et al<sup><xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
described the VE with short coupling interval originating from the distal Purkinje
fibers as the main triggering factors of idiopathic VF. These extrasystoles had
different morphologies and were mapped in several locations of the Purkinje system,
including the anterior right ventricular region and large areas of the lower half of
the left ventricular septum. The authors ruled out these triggers by focal catheter
ablation in 27 patients.</p>
      <p>Throughout a mean follow up of 24 months, 89% of patients had no recurrence of
ventricular fibrillation<sup><xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. These
findings demonstrate that a therapeutic possibility in this patient population would
be treatment by catheter ablation; however, it should be noted that all patients
were under the protection of an ICD. In our series, two patients underwent attempted
ablation of VE, but the non-occurrence of VE during the procedure prevented their
accurate mapping, which would justify the moment of the electrical storm as the
ideal setting for the attempted ablation. Another indication for ablative therapy
would be cases of appropriate therapies for the ICD, refractory to use of calcium
channel blockers.</p>
      <p>Regarding family screening, there is no specific reference in the literature about
the best management and medical decision in asymptomatic individuals remains
controversial. All four patients in our series underwent family screening and
extrasystoles with short coupling interval were found in the daughter of Patient 2.
Due to the limited data in the literature in asymptomatic individuals, together with
the family, we chose to institute a clinical follow-up and prophylactic and empiric
prescription of verapamil.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="conclusions">
      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>VE patients with short coupling may carry a rare syndrome, probably of genetic
etiology, which can result in TdP. Verapamil is apparently the most effective drug
for alleviating the occurrence of these arrhythmias; however, it is not effective
enough to eliminate the need for an ICD. Ablation of VE could reduce the incidence
of TdP; however, there are still technical limitations to its effective
implementation. A new look at the disease and the knowledge of this rare heart
rhythm disorder is needed so that cardiologists can be able to recognize this
electrocardiographic detail and thus identify apparently healthy individuals at risk
of genetically determined sudden death.</p>
