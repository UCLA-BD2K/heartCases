      <abstract>
        <p>Germline mutations may cause human disease by various mechanisms. Missense and other in-frame mutations may be deleterious because the mutant proteins are not correctly targeted, do not function correctly, or both. We studied a child with mycobacterial disease caused by homozygosity for a novel in-frame microinsertion in <italic>IFNGR2</italic>. In cells transfected with the mutant allele, most of the interferon &#x3B3; receptor 2 (IFN-&#x3B3;R2) protein was retained within the cell, and that expressed on the cell surface had an abnormally high molecular weight (MW). The misfolding mutation was not gain-of-glycosylation, as it created no new N-glycosylation site. The mutant <italic>IFNGR2</italic> allele was null, as the patient's cells did not respond to IFN-&#x3B3;. Based on the well-established relationship between protein N-glycosylation and protein quality control processes, we tested 29 compounds affecting maturation by N-glycosylation in the secretory pathway. Remarkably, up to 13 of these compounds reduced the MW of surface-expressed mutant IFN-&#x3B3;R2 molecules and restored cellular responsiveness to IFN-&#x3B3;. Modifiers of N-glycosylation may therefore complement human cells carrying in-frame and misfolding, but not necessarily gain-of-glycosylation, mutations in genes encoding proteins subject to trafficking via the secretory pathway. Some of these compounds are available for clinical use, paving the way for clinical trials of chemical complementation for various human genetic traits.</p>

  <body><p>Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD) is a primary immunodeficiency that selectively weakens host resistance to mycobacteria, such as bacille Calmette-Gu&#xE9;rin (BCG) vaccines and environmental mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). There are six known MSMD-causing genes (<italic>IL12B</italic>, <italic>IL12RB1</italic>, <italic>NEMO</italic>, <italic>IFNGR1</italic>, <italic>IFNGR2</italic>, and <italic>STAT1</italic>), all of which are involved in IFN-&#x3B3;&#x2013;mediated immunity. Mutations in <italic>IL12B</italic>, <italic>IL12RB1</italic>, and <italic>NEMO</italic> impair the IL-12&#x2013;dependent production of IFN-&#x3B3;. In contrast, mutations in <italic>IFNGR1</italic>, <italic>IFNGR2</italic>, and <italic>STAT1</italic> impair cellular responses to IFN-&#x3B3;. These genes display high levels of allelic heterogeneity, resulting in the definition of at least 13 different disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Four forms of IFN-&#x3B3;R2 deficiency have been described at the cellular level, although all known patients with IFN-&#x3B3;R2 deficiency present only one of the three types of recessive MSMD. The first type was first identified in 1998 in a patient with complete IFN-&#x3B3;R2 deficiency, homozygous for a loss-of-expression mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Patients with complete IFN-&#x3B3;R2 deficiency caused by surface-expressed, nonfunctional IFN-&#x3B3;R2 molecules were later reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Finally, a child homozygous for a hypomorphic <italic>IFNGR2</italic> mutation and residual IFN-&#x3B3; responsiveness was reported, defining partial IFN-&#x3B3;R2 deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Dominant IFN-&#x3B3;R2 deficiency has not yet been reported in any symptomatic patient, but it was recently shown that cells from a healthy heterozygous carrier display weak IFN-&#x3B3; responses, suggesting that there may be patients with novel, disease-causing, dominant mutations in <italic>IFNGR2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). In any event, patients with complete IFN-&#x3B3;R2 deficiency have a much more severe prognosis than patients with partial deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>).</p><p>We studied a new patient with MSMD in whom we diagnosed complete IFN-&#x3B3;R2 deficiency. She was homozygous for an in-frame <italic>IFNGR2</italic> mutation (382-387dup), potentially associated with a lack of production, a lack of surface expression, or the surface expression of nonfunctional receptors. Most of the mutant 382-387dup IFN-&#x3B3;R2 protein was of low molecular weight (MW) and failed to mature normally. However, mature, Endoglycosidase H (Endo-H)&#x2013;resistant proteins of high MW, reflecting excessive N-glycosylation, were also found. Unlike the T168N mutation previously reported in <italic>IFNGR2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), this mutation was not gain-of-glycosylation, in that it did not create a new N-glycosylation site. The in-frame 382-387dup <italic>IFNGR2</italic> allele thus encoded misfolded proteins that were abnormally targeted, abnormally N-glycosylated, or both. The link between protein quality control and protein N-glycosylation in the secretory pathway is well established (see Supplemental discussion, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071987/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071987/DC1</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). In particular, glucosidases I and II, in addition to their role in the N-glycosylation process, also contribute to the folding of glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), their concomitant quality control by calnexin-calreticulin, and their subsequent trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). ER&#x2013;mannosidase I is also involved in glycoprotein folding, quality control, and trafficking (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). The potential genetic implications of the connection between quality control and N-glycosylation for the chemical complementation of in-frame mutations leading to misfolded proteins have not been investigated. We investigated whether modifiers of N-glycosylation, including compounds available for clinical use for other purposes, could complement our IFN-&#x3B3;R2&#x2013;deficient patients' cells in vitro and ex vivo.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>A novel loss-of-function <italic>IFNGR2</italic> allele (382-387dup)</title><p>Patient 1 (P1) with MSMD was homozygous for a previously unidentified in-frame microduplication of six nucleotides (382&#x2013;387) in <italic>IFNGR2</italic> (designated 382-387dup; (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). This mutation is predicted to result in the duplication of amino acids T128 and M129 in the protein (WV<underline>TM</underline>PW&#x2192;WV<underline>TMTM</underline>PW; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). This duplication neither creates nor deletes known consensus sites for posttranslational modifications; in particular, it is not a gain-of-glycosylation mutation, as it creates no consensus site for N-glycosylation, unlike the previously reported T168N mutation in <italic>IFNGR2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). It was not found in 50 and 77 unrelated healthy individuals of European and Arabian descent, respectively. The parents and one sibling of this patient are heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in the other sibling. No IFN-&#x3B3;&#x2013;activated sequence (GAS)&#x2013;binding proteins were detected in EMSAs with EBV-transformed B cells from P1 stimulated with IFN-&#x3B3; (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Similarly, no such proteins were detected in cells from two previously described children homozygous for other mutations: an in-frame 27-bp microdeletion of nucleotides 663&#x2013;689 (designated 663del27 in P2, another in-frame <italic>IFNGR2</italic> mutation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>) and the 278delAG-null frameshift deletion (negative control, C&#x2212;, lacking IFN-&#x3B3;R2 expression, used as a negative control; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). IFN-&#x3B3;R2&#x2013;deficient EBV-transformed B cells homozygous for the 278delAG allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) were complemented by the WT allele but not by any of the three mutant <italic>IFNGR2</italic> alleles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Thus, P1, like P2, was homozygous for an in-frame <italic>IFNGR2</italic> mutation causing complete functional IFN-&#x3B3;R2 deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), an allele conferring a complete lack of cellular responses to IFN-&#x3B3;.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Clinical phenotype, <italic>IFNGR2</italic> genotype, and cellular phenotype of patients with MSMD.</bold> (A) Clinical phenotypes of consanguineous patients.

WT IFN-&#x3B3;R2 was predominantly located in large vesicles in the cytoplasm, displaying the perinuclear distribution typical of the secretory pathway. In contrast, the 382-387dup and 663del27 IFN-&#x3B3;R2 molecules were disseminated in smaller cytoplasmic vesicles, suggesting that they were abnormally trafficked as misfolded proteins (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071987/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071987/DC1</ext-link>). We then explored the intracellular trafficking of mutant IFN-&#x3B3;R2 from P1 and P2 by transfecting Hek293 cells with <italic>IFNGR2</italic> alleles encoding V5-tagged molecules and detecting IFN-&#x3B3;R2 in the lysates of these cells by Western blotting (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>; and Fig. S2, A and B). No IFN-&#x3B3;R2&#x2013;specific antibody suitable for such experiments on the patients' cells (or cells overexpressing <italic>IFNGR2</italic> alleles) is currently available. Both mutant proteins segregated into two major groups of low (&#x223C;55) and high (&#x223C;80) MW. This maturation profile is typical of misfolded proteins and results from insufficient glycosylation (giving the lower MW) and impaired maturation upstream in the secretory pathway (lack of trimming of the glycan moieties, resulting in an abnormally high MW). In both cases, most proteins were of low MW and failed to mature normally, as shown by their sensitivity to Endo-H (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). The high MW of mature, Endo-H&#x2013;resistant proteins reflected insufficient maturation of the glycosylated proteins, as shown by their digestion with PNGase-F. Polyubiquitinylation, which has been reported to be responsible for the high MW of other misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), was not involved in this case, because digestion with PNGase-F resulted in the complete normalization of MW (Fig. S1 B). Thus, the two in-frame loss-of-function <italic>IFNGR2</italic> alleles (382-387dup in P1 and 663del27 in P2) encoded misfolded proteins that were abnormally N-glycosylated.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Biochemical properties of IFN-&#x3B3;R2 under various chemical treatments.</bold> (A) Hek-293 cells were transfected with 278delAG, WT, 382-387dup, and 663del27 IFN-&#x3B3;R2&#x2013;tagged V5 constructs. They were then incubated alone or with 1 &#x3BC;M kifunensine, 1.5 mM NB-DNJ, or 2 mM castanospermine for 48 h. Whole-cell extracts were generated, and left untreated or digested with Endo-H overnight. They were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti-V5 antibody. (B) Maturation of N-linked oligosaccharides: the triglucosylated polymannose oligosaccharides (GlcNac, yellow squares; mannose, blue circles; glucose, red circles; galactose, orange circles) transferred to the asparagine residues of proteins (green) from dolichol phosphate during the translation of mRNA on ribosomes. This oligosaccharide was then matured by incubation with a series of enzymes, including glucosidase I or II (G-I or G-II), glucosyl transferase (UGTI), erp57, calnexin (CNX), calreticulin (Crt), ER&#x2013;mannosidase I or II (ERM-I or ERM-II), M9-mannase (M9M), Golgi&#x2013;mannosidase I or II (GM-I or GM-II), and glucosyl transferase I (GnT-I). Alternative pathways involving mannosidases (M*) or Golgi-endomannosidase (G-EM) are able to bypass the classical pathway. Some pathways for unfolded proteins lead to proteasomal or nonproteasomal proteolysis.

We therefore hypothesized that NB-DNJ (Zavesca) and castanospermine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), which inhibit glucosidases I and II, and kifunensine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), an inhibitor of ER&#x2013;mannosidase I, might improve the glycosylation or trafficking of the nonnative IFN-&#x3B3;R2 molecules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>; and Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071987/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071987/DC1</ext-link>). NB-DNJ and castanospermine had no detectable impact on WT IFN-&#x3B3;R2 glycoproteins (MW of &#x223C;60), but most of the mutant molecules, including Endo-H&#x2013;resistant proteins of high MW, displayed a shift in MW to &#x223C;60 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In contrast, kifunensine impaired the maturation of both WT and mutant molecules, which became sensitive to Endo-H (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). We assessed the surface expression of IFN-&#x3B3;R2 by biotinylating surface-expressed proteins in IFN-&#x3B3;R2&#x2013;deficient fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) transfected with various V5-tagged IFN-&#x3B3;R2 constructs, and assessing IFN-&#x3B3;R2 production in total extracts, the streptavidin-bound fraction, and flow through by Western blotting with a V5-specific antibody (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>). Most WT molecules with a MW &gt;60 were expressed at the cell surface, except in the presence of kifunensine. In contrast, only a small fraction of mutant molecules was expressed at the surface, even after treatment with NB-DNJ, castanospermine, or kifunensine. However, after treatment with any of these three drugs, mutant IFN-&#x3B3;R2 molecules with a MW of &#x223C;60, corresponding to the MW of WT molecules, appeared on the cell surface (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). The maturation of the 382-387dup and 663del27 IFN-&#x3B3;R2 molecules in the presence of NB-DNJ, castanospermine, or kifunensine thus resulted in the expression of a detectable fraction of receptors at the cell surface with a MW similar to that of WT proteins under the same conditions, with 663del27 molecules being somewhat lighter owing to the deletion of nine residues. It is unclear whether the surface-expressed mutant IFN-&#x3B3;R2 molecules of normal MW detected in the presence of these compounds were generated by the maturation of IFN-&#x3B3;R2 molecules of low MW that would otherwise have been retained in the secretory pathway, or by the maturation of high MW molecules that had reached the cell surface. The time-course experiments revealed that NB-DNJ exerted its effects on MW after 9 h, whereas castanospermine and kifunensine exerted their effects only after 24 h (Fig. S2, A and B). The exact MW of the IFN-&#x3B3;R2 WT molecules responding to IFN-&#x3B3; is unknown. We can only predict that the mutant IFN-&#x3B3;R2 molecules with a MW closer to that of the WT in the presence of glycosylation inhibitors are the most likely to be active. Finally, the stability and natural degradation of WT and mutant IFN-&#x3B3;R2 molecules were independent of the proteasome, as shown by experiments with the inhibitor MG132 (Fig. S3). Moreover, mutant and WT proteins behaved similarly in the presence of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor (Fig. S3).</p></sec><sec><title>Functional complementation of the 382-387dup <italic>IFNGR2</italic> allele in EBV-transformed B cells, SV40-transformed fibroblasts, and blood cells</title><p>We therefore investigated whether cells from P1 or P2 could be functionally complemented by culturing EBV-transformed B cells with NB-DNJ, castanospermine, or kifunensine for 16 h, and then stimulating them with IFN-&#x3B3; for 30 min (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). WT cells responded to IFN-&#x3B3; in the presence of each of these compounds, as shown by EMSA. Cells from a negative control (C&#x2212;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) and cells from P2 (663del27) did not respond to IFN-&#x3B3;, even in the presence of these drugs. However, cells from P1 (382-387dup) regained responsiveness to IFN-&#x3B3; upon treatment with NB-DNJ or castanospermine. Surprisingly, they responded to an even greater extent when treated with kifunensine, with responses reaching normal levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). This functional complementation did not result from the trimming of extended IFN-&#x3B3;R2 glycans impairing IFN-&#x3B3; binding to IFN-&#x3B3;R1, as the patient's cells had normal numbers of IFN-&#x3B3; binding sites of normal affinity (unpublished data). When EBV-transformed B cells from P1 were treated with NB-DNJ, castanospermine, or kifunensine for 16 h and were stimulated with various doses of IFN-&#x3B3; for 30 min, they responded to as little as 100 IU/ml IFN-&#x3B3; (Fig. S4 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071987/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071987/DC1</ext-link>). We then assayed a more distal event, using flow cytometry to test the induction of HLA-DR on the surface of SV40-transformed fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Cells from P1, unlike those from all other patients, responded normally to IFN-&#x3B3; after treatment with any of the three molecules tested. Kifunensine was particularly efficient, as it was effective at concentrations &lt;1 &#x3BC;M and no toxicity was observed, even at millimolar concentrations. In such conditions, fibroblasts from P1 responded to as little as 100 IU/ml IFN-&#x3B3; (Fig. S4 B). Finally, we stimulated freshly prepared PBMCs with live BCG, BCG plus IFN-&#x3B3;, or IFN-&#x3B3; alone, and determined IL-12p40 and p70 levels by ELISA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), in the presence or absence of the only commercially available compound, NB-DNJ (Zavesca). NB-DNJ restored the responsiveness to BCG plus IFN-&#x3B3; and to IFN-&#x3B3; alone with PBMCs from P1 (Fig. S5 and Fig. S6). Unfortunately, our patient died before we could test kifunensine. Thus, IFN-&#x3B3;R2&#x2013;deficient cells from P1, whether immortalized lymphoid and fibroblastic cell lines or freshly prepared blood cells, were complemented by modifiers of glycosylation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Chemical complementation of the cellular phenotype with multiple drugs.</bold> (A) Response of EBV-transformed B cells to IFN-&#x3B3;, as determined by EMSA analysis of GAS probe&#x2013;binding nuclear proteins from a positive control (C+), a negative control (C&#x2212;, homozygous for the 278delAG <italic>IFNGR2</italic> allele), and two patients (P1, bearing mutation 382-387dup, and P2, bearing mutation 663del27) in response to 10<sup>5</sup> IU/ml IFN-&#x3B3; treatment for 30 min, 16 h after incubation with 1.5 mM NB-DNJ, 2 mM castanospermine, or 1 &#x3BC;M kifunensine.

The 382-387dup IFN-&#x3B3;R2 molecules were not of normal MW (i.e., 60) in cells genetically deficient for either glucosidase II or glucosidase I (these cells are functionally deficient for both enzymes, as they cannot produce glucosidase II substrates; unpublished data). NB-DNJ and castanospermine therefore complemented the patient's cells by inhibiting another, as yet unknown, enzyme, and possibly, but not necessarily, by also inhibiting glucosidase I and/or II. We tested this hypothesis using most of the commercially available compounds known to inhibit the various steps of glycosylation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref> and Table S1). We incubated SV40-transformed fibroblasts separately with each of the 29 drugs and IFN-&#x3B3; for 72 h. Cell-surface HLA-DR expression was assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. S7, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071987/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071987/DC1</ext-link>). None of the compounds impaired the response of control cells or restored IFN-&#x3B3; responsiveness in fibroblasts from P2 and C&#x2212;. However, 13 compounds restored IFN-&#x3B3; responsiveness in cells from P1 (Fig. S7). Six drugs fully complemented cells from P1 when tested at the recommended inhibitory concentrations (NB-DNJ, castanospermine, NM-DNJ, NB-DMJ, kifunensine, and 2-5-DM; Fig. S7). Eight other compounds had a detectable but weaker effect. In contrast, 16 inhibitors did not complement the patient's cells (these compounds included tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation that blocks assembly of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor). The inefficacy of australine, DMJ, and swainsonine suggested that the inhibition of glucosidase I, ER&#x2013;mannosidase I, or Golgi&#x2013;mannosidase II alone was insufficient to complement cells from P1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref> and Table S1). We tested combinations of two compounds, each used at its minimal effective concentration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and Table S1). No inhibitory effect was detected, but additive effects were observed for several combinations and synergic effects were observed in several cases (Fig. S8). Interestingly, no complementation was observed if australine was used with bromoconduritol or miglitol (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), suggesting that NB-DNJ and castanospermine also inhibited another, as yet unknown, enzyme in the N-glycosylation machinery. Further evidence to support this hypothesis is provided by the synergy conferred by NB-DGJ. Nonetheless, australine and castanospermine acted in synergy, suggesting that a potent and combined inhibition of glucosidase I and II is efficient. Paradoxically, kifunensine and swainsonine complemented the cells when used together, whereas DMJ alone did not (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The complementation of cells from P1 may thus reflect the combined inhibition of several enzymes, such as glucosidases I and II, ER&#x2013;mannosidase I, and other, as yet unknown, enzymes.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Observation of the effects of pairs of chemical compounds.</bold> SV40-transformed fibroblasts from P1, bearing mutation 382-387dup, were incubated for 16 h in complete culture medium supplemented with 2.4 &#xD7; 10<sup>4</sup> IU/ml IFN-&#x3B3;.

None of these compounds or the proteasome inhibitor tested (MG132) complemented the cell lines tested in our study (unpublished data). Curcumin was reported to complement delF508-CFTR in one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>) but not in another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), and it did not complement the cell lines studied in this report (unpublished data). Pharmacological chaperones, designed for the specific complementation of target proteins, are less toxic and therefore more promising, but their specificity is not compatible with broad application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>).

We could not assess whether the unfolded protein responses were triggered by the mutant proteins, as X-box binding protein 1&#x2013;specific antibodies gave negative results in Western blots of HEK epithelial cells transfected with the different constructs, whereas we detected X-box binding protein 1 in similar amounts in WT and mutant SV40&#x2013;transformed fibroblastic cells (unpublished data). Unlike chemical and pharmacological chaperones, inhibitors of glycosylation do not interact directly. Instead, they have an indirect effect via the inhibition of selected glycosylation enzymes. Our data identify no simple, specific mechanism of complementation, but they do show convincingly that multiple modifiers of N-glycosylation, alone or in combination, can efficiently complement the <italic>IFNGR2</italic> mutation, strongly suggesting that the key process involved is the modification of N-glycosylation. Deciphering the exact molecular mechanism of action of these compounds is, however, beyond the scope of this report.</p><p>Our successful complementation of misfolding mutations by this novel class of chemical chaperone&#x2013;like molecules opens up new avenues of research. Several modifiers of N-glycosylation complemented a misfolding mutation in <italic>IFNGR2</italic>. They might complement mutations in other genes. Moreover, unlike most other previously reported chemical and pharmacological chaperones, which were active in transfected or tumor cells overproducing the mutant protein, these compounds complemented germline cells in vitro and ex vivo. Our findings raise hopes that chemical modifiers of N-glycosylation could be curative in some patients bearing mutations in genes encoding proteins subject to trafficking via the secretory pathway: not only patients with gain-of-glycosylation mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), but also patients bearing other types of misfolding mutation. Kifunensine is a good candidate, as it has a wide window of efficacy without toxicity in vitro; unlike chaperones, which work at millimolar concentrations, it worked at below micromolar concentrations. Derivatives of castanospermine are also potentially useful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Nevertheless, modifiers of glycosylation should be tested carefully, as they may result in an acquired form of congenital disorders of glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>).

This figure also shows that the high MW of the mutant IFN-&#x3B3;R2 proteins results from abnormal glycosylation. Fig. S2 shows biochemical properties of IFN-&#x3B3;R2 molecules, in the presence of NB-DNJ, castanospermine, or kifunensine, in a time-course experiment. Fig. S3 depicts biochemical properties of IFN-&#x3B3;R2 molecules, in the presence of inhibitors of the proteasome or of protein synthesis, in a time-course experiment. Fig. S4 shows an IFN-&#x3B3; or IFN-&#x3B1; response of EBV-transformed B cells and SV40-transformed fibroblasts from a positive control, the patient, and a negative control in the presence of NB-DNJ, castanospermine, or kifunensine. This figure also shows that the IFN-&#x3B1; response of EBV-transformed B cells is not altered by NB-DNJ or castanospermine treatment. Fig. S5 shows IFN-&#x3B3; responses of PBMCs from a positive control and the patient in the presence of NB-DNJ and castanospermine, as assessed by quantifying the production of IL-12p40 and IL-12p70. Fig. S6 depicts IFN-&#x3B3; responses of PBMCs from positive controls in the presence of NB-DNJ and castanospermine and from negative controls, as assessed by quantifying the production of IL-12p40. Fig. S7 depicts IFN-&#x3B3; responses of SV40-transformed fibroblasts from a positive control, the patient, and a negative control in the presence of 13 inhibitors of N-glycosylation, as assessed by measurements of HLA-DR induction. Fig. S8 shows examples of the additive and synergistic effects of the different drugs on the patient's IFN-&#x3B3; response, as assessed by measuring HLA-DR induction in SV40-transformed cells. Supplemental discussion contains information about N-glycosylation and quality control of proteins undergoing trafficking in the secretory pathway.
