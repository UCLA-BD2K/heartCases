      <abstract>
        <p>We have examined a 5th to 6th century inhumation from Great Chesterford, Essex, UK. The incomplete remains are those of a young male, aged around 21&#x2013;35 years at death. The remains show osteological evidence of lepromatous leprosy (LL) and this was confirmed by lipid biomarker analysis and ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis, which provided evidence for both multi-copy and single copy loci from the <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic> genome. Genotyping showed the strain belonged to the 3I lineage, but the Great Chesterford isolate appeared to be ancestral to 3I strains found in later medieval cases in southern Britain and also continental Europe. While a number of contemporaneous cases exist, at present, this case of leprosy is the earliest radiocarbon dated case in Britain confirmed by both aDNA and lipid biomarkers. Importantly, Strontium and Oxygen isotope analysis suggest that the individual is likely to have originated from outside Britain. This potentially sheds light on the origins of the strain in Britain and its subsequent spread to other parts of the world, including the Americas where the 3I lineage of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> is still found in some southern states of America.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Leprosy, caused by <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic>, has been described in historical texts since ancient times and archaeological and osteological findings indicate its existence in human populations for thousands of years [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. There is scant detail concerning the origin of leprosy in European populations, but an epidemic of infection peaked between the 12<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> centuries. We and others have studied the genomes of medieval <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> strains to reveal that the decline of leprosy was not a result of changes in the pathogen genome [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and so may have been due to other suggested factors such as changing socioeconomic conditions or interaction with concomitant epidemics of other infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and plague. By using a multidisciplinary approach applied to bioarchaeological remains, we reason it should be possible to understand more about the rise and decline of leprosy in Europe.</p>
      <p>Burial GC96, the subject of the current study, was excavated from the Anglo-Saxon cemetery located to the northwest of Great Chesterford, on the boundary between Cambridgeshire and Essex. The excavation dates to the period between October 1953 and April 1954 and was from the second of three brief periods of rescue archaeology undertaken by Vera Evison on behalf of the Inspectorate of Ancient Monuments in the wake of commercial gravel extraction in the area [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Radiocarbon dating undertaken for the present study shows this burial dates to between the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> centuries AD.</p>
      <p>The skeleton shows some lesions suggestive of lepromatous leprosy (LL). The remains are amongst the earliest known in Britain with indications of leprosy. Although other cases of similar period are known in Britain [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], none of these earlier cases have been studied using modern techniques. Consequently, nothing is known of the causative strains of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> at this time or of the likely geographical origin of the affected individuals. We have therefore applied osteological, biomolecular and geochemical isotopic analyses to GC96 in an attempt to understand the pathogen genome as well as the origin and any possible migrations undertaken by this individual and how this relates to the spread of the disease during this period.</p>

        <p>As excavations took place over 60 years ago, no permits were required for the described study, which complied with all relevant regulations. As the skeletal material is over 100 years old, it is not subject to the Human Tissue Act (2004). The original excavation was carried out with the permission of the landowner and tenant at the behest of the Inspectorate for Ancient Monuments [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The individual studied was specimen GC96 which is currently curated at the Department of Archaeology at the University of Southampton, UK.</p>
        <p>Grave 96 was orientated west-east, with the head at the west end of the grave. The body was in a semi-flexed supine position at a depth of 91cm. The legs were flexed and the knees were pointing towards the right side of the grave. The arms were flexed at the elbow and the hands were placed on the left thorax/shoulder. The face was superiorly orientated with a lean toward the left of the grave (see <xref rid="pone.0124282.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The individual had a number of grave items including a spear and a conical ferrule, found above the left shoulder, a buckle loop and a knife in the abdominal area and shoelace tag found near the right ankle.</p>

        <p>Bone preservation varies between good and excellent, with most of the cortical bone available for macroscopic inspection (75%+). The skull has suffered <italic>post-mortem</italic> damage to the facial area. There was no evidence for animal gnawing, but all of the bones have some minor root etching.</p>
        <p>While the mandible and most of the vault is present, the facial bones are largely absent. With the exception of the left arm (humerus, radius and ulna), all of the major long bones are present. Only the left fibula is missing its distal epiphysis, the other bones were complete. The clavicles, <italic>os coxae</italic>, sacrum and scapulae are represented. Along with eight metatarsals (5 left and 3 right), all of the right tarsals and the left talus are present. Four proximal, one intermediate and one distal foot phalanges are present. The hand bones, pre-sacral vertebrae and ribs are missing.</p>
        <p>Estimation of age was undertaken using epiphyseal fusion as outlined in Scheuer and Black (2000) [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and dental wear as described in Brothwell (1981) [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Sex was determined from the sexually dimorphic traits of the cranium and the pelvis [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Alterations due to disease were recorded using careful visual examination of the remains.</p>

Two were for the multicopy RLEP element. One of these, a real-time PCR (RT-PCR) method using an intercalating fluorescent dye (EVAGreen) has been previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A second method for RLEP, employing a dual labelled hybridisation probe was developed in the course of this study. This method was designed to amplify template sizes of 78 bp and above, and should provide greater scope for detecting the pathogen from extremely degraded samples as well as improved specificity. The details of primers and probe are shown in <xref rid="pone.0124282.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Additionally, we used a second probe method, for the 18-kDa-antigen gene, present in single copy in the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> genome. Samples which were also positive using this method were taken forward for genotyping.</p>

Additionally we also used those primers described by Truman and co-workers [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] for further sub-typing 3I strains. These allow determination of the 4 main SNP types and also the subtype (A-O) of the strain. Primer sequences and assay conditions for many of these methods have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, <xref rid="pone.0124282.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> lists only new methods developed for genotyping or refinements to the earlier methods. Similarly, VNTR profiling of three variable loci, AGA(20), GTA(9) and 21&#x2013;3 was undertaken as previously described (12).</p>

              <p>PCR amplification details. PCR was performed in a final volume of 25&#x3BC;l, using a hot start Taq kit from Qiagen (product 203445). The reactions contained 25 pmol of forward and reverse primers, each in 1&#x3BC;l, 12.5 &#x3BC;l of the kit master mix, 2.5 &#x3BC;l non-acetylated bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma B4287) and 1&#x3BC;l of template. The kit magnesium ion concentration of 1.5 mM per reaction was supplemented to 2 mM for PCR methods using EVAGreen and to 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> for RT PCR with the RLEP and 18-kD hydrolysis probes. The probes were used at a final concentration of 100 nM. The volumes were made up to 25 &#x3BC;l with molecular biology grade water (Sigma). After an initial activation step of 14 min at 95&#xB0;C, 41 cycles of amplification were performed on an Mx3005P RT-PCR platform (Agilent Technologies).</p>
              <p>The thermal profile of the amplification cycles consisted of denaturation at 95&#xB0;C for 10 s, annealing (range 52&#x2013;60&#xB0;C) for 30 s and extension at 72&#xB0;C for 30 s. Fluorescence data was acquired during the extension step in RT-PCR runs. Melt analyses was performed automatically at the end of runs monitored with EVAGreen and dissociation curves studied to identify likely positives.</p>

PCR products were also run out on either 3% or 3.5% agarose gels in a TAE buffer system alongside appropriate DNA size markers (100 bp or 50 bp DNA ladders, Promega) to confirm product identity. Positive samples for SNP or MLVA typing were bulk purified on 3% (wt/vol) low-melting-point agarose (Invitrogen); bands were excised and purified using a Geneclean DNA isolation kit (Cat.No.1001-200, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mpbio.com">mpbio.com</ext-link>).

Subsequent separation was performed on an Alltech 209250 (500 mg) normal phase silica gel cartridge, which yielded separate fractions possibly containing non-hydroxylated PFB esters and mycolic acid (MA) PFB esters.</p>
          <p>The MA PFB esters were reacted with pyrenebutyric acid (PBA) to produce PBA-PFB MA derivatives, which were refined on an Alltech 205250 (500 mg) C18 reverse phase cartridge [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The presence of PBA-PFB mycolates was investigated by reverse phase HPLC and the total MAs were collected and analysed by normal phase HPLC.

          <title>c). Isotopic Analysis</title>
          <p>Strontium and oxygen isotopic analysis were carried out on tooth enamel of GC96 to shed light on the individual&#x2019;s childhood origins.</p>
          <p>For strontium isotope analysis, a longitudinal section of enamel approximately 1mm thick was removed from the lower second molar using a hand drill and diamond cutting disk. The sample was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath in 18M&#x3A9; H<sub>2</sub>O for ten minutes and dried overnight. For analysis, the sample was mounted in the laser cell by pressing into blue-tack. Sr isotopic analysis was performed on a Finnegan Neptune multi collector ICP-MS with a New Wave 193 nm ArF homogenized excimer laser, using the oxide reduction technique of De Jong [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124282.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The measurement of Sr isotopes by laser ablation has only recently been made reliable. The primary difficulty has been the molecular interference on <sup>87</sup>Sr of <sup>40</sup>Ca<sup>31</sup>P<sup>16</sup>O<sup>+</sup> which is the primary constituent of the enamel matrix. Other potential problems come from double-charged rare earth elements which give mass-to-charge ratios of between 84 and 88, calcium-calcium and calcium-argide dimers which can interfere with <sup>84</sup>Sr, <sup>86</sup>Sr and <sup>88</sup>Sr, in addition to potential <sup>87</sup>Rb and <sup>86</sup>Kr interferences. Our approach has been to minimize oxide formation (monitored as <sup>254</sup>(UO)<sup>+</sup>/<sup>238</sup>U<sup>+</sup>) through careful control of plasma conditions, and to monitor and reject teeth that have significant rare earth concentrations which we consider diagenetic. We correct for the <sup>86</sup>Kr using an on peak gas blank and for rubidium interference using the natural <sup>87</sup>Rb/<sup>85</sup>Rb ratio of 0.385617. A small positive offset from known values <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr of standards is usually observed, but is within the precision of a typical measurement.</p>
          <p>Time series of strontium isotopes are obtained as continuous data by moving the tooth along the growth axis of the tooth at 5&#x3BC;ms<sup>-1</sup> as the laser pulses with a repetition rate of 10Hz and spot size 150 &#x3BC;m, giving a fluence of c.8.6 Jcm<sup>-2</sup>. Strontium isotopes in the dentine were measured as spot samples by pulsing the laser for 240 s at each spot without moving the sample.</p>
          <p>Repeat analysis of an in-house ashed bovine pellet standard (BP1) bracketing analyses of GC96, showed an offset of +89&#xB1;98 ppm (1 sigma) for the laser ablation analyses over TIMS values. This is within the precision of individual measurements of 150-300ppm and the total variation within the enamel of 1200ppm, and is therefore considered insignificant to our interpretation of the isotopes.</p>
          <p>For oxygen isotope analysis a second and similar section was taken from the same tooth. Surface dirt and any dentine were removed from the section using a dental bur. The sample was ground to a fine powder in an agate mortar under acetone, dried and leached for 1 hour in 0.1M acetic acid to remove diagenetic carbonate. The sample was then centrifuged and washed in 18M&#x3A9; H<sub>2</sub>O three times and dried.</p>
          <p>The oxygen isotopes in the carbonate fraction of tooth enamel were measured on an Isoprime Dual-Inlet mass-spectrometer connected to a Gilson auto-sampler using standard carbonate procedures. For comparison with published measurements on enamel phosphate oxygen isotopes and rainwater &#x3B4;<sup>18</sup>O, structural carbonate values were converted to phosphate values and then to drinking water equivalents [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124282.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>

          <p>Based on the cranial and pelvic features, GC96 was sexed as male. The auricular surface, pubic symphysis, complete epiphyseal fusion and light dental wear suggested that the individual was between 25 and 35 years of age at death. Pathological changes were identified on the right ulna, left and right tibiae and fibulae and the left and right foot bones.</p>
          <p>On the distal posterior surface of the right ulna, above the styloid process, a small patch (&#x2248;1cm<sup>2</sup>) of remodelled periosteal new bone growth was observed.</p>
          <p>Both tibiae and fibulae had changes extending from the proximal midshaft onto all of the bone surfaces inferior to it. All four bones had new bone growth on the periosteal surfaces. On both the left and right sides, remodelled lamellar bone was evident, which was orientated longitudinally and took on a nodular appearance where the new bone was thickest, particularly along the interosseous borders. The nodular appearance suggests multiple episodes of new bone apposition with healing. On the left tibia, woven bone, which was porous and disorganised, was observed on the medial malleolus and on the medial and anterior aspect of the distal diaphysis (<xref rid="pone.0124282.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The nature of the lesions suggests an active process at the time of death. In addition to the new bone growth, increased bone porosity is seen in the distal diaphysis and epiphysis of the left tibia.</p>

          <p>On the right foot, with the exception of right metatarsal one, the tarsometatarsal joints have undergone extensive remodelling, largely as a result of bone destruction. The right second, third and fifth metatarsals have mid-shaft pencilling and almost complete destruction to the distal articular surfaces (<xref rid="pone.0124282.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). It is not clear whether right metatarsal four had been lost <italic>pre</italic>- or <italic>post-mortem</italic>, but a small fragment remains ankylosed to the proximal shaft of metatarsal five. The head of the right first metatarsal and the corresponding proximal joint surface of the hallical phalanx have destructive lesions resembling those at the tarsometatarsal joints. The proximal and intermediate phalanges of the fourth pedal ray are ankylosed. On the left foot, thick new bone growth surrounds the mid-shaft of the left first metatarsal and portions of the left second metatarsal. The sharp edges to the new bone growth and disorganised appearance suggest that the lesion was active at the time of death.</p>

In contrast, reactive bone taken from the first metatarsal was PCR negative using both RLEP assays and the 18-kD method. A second set of samples, taken from left talus, pooled fibulae (L+R) and calcaneum were positive for RLEP (both 111 and 78 bp amplicons) and also for the 18-kD antigen DNA, although the calcaneum was only weakly positive for the latter marker (<xref rid="pone.0124282.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

              <p>The strontium analysis of the enamel showed periodic variation in <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr between 0.7088 and 0.7101 (<xref rid="pone.0124282.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). The bedrock geology in the immediate vicinity to Great Chesterford is Upper Cretaceous chalk, which would give a <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr of 0.7073&#x2013;0.7080 [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This range is not represented in the enamel analyses (<xref rid="pone.0124282.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>), but is reflected in the lower isotopic ratios of the dentine which reflects a mix of biogenic strontium (i.e. similar values to the enamel) and diagenetic strontium from the immediate burial environment (presumably in the range of 0.7073&#x2013;0.7080). On face value then, the strontium results suggest this individual is not local to Great Chesterford. However, strontium isotopic values of 0.7088&#x2013;0.7101 are typical for large swathes of SE Britain [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> (see map)] including regions abutting the Cretaceous Chalk within a few 10s of km of Great Chesterford, so the enamel isotopic range is consistent with a childhood origin somewhere in the wider region.</p>

              <p>However, strontium isotopic values are rarely unique for a specific location, and the oxygen isotope evidence provides stronger evidence for the non-local origin of GC96. The equivalent drinking water, &#x3B4;O<sup>18</sup> = -8.1 &#x2030; (<xref rid="pone.0124282.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) gives an isotopic value at the extreme range of rainfall values for Britain e.g. see map [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], with values of &gt;-8.0 <bold>&#x2030;</bold> estimated only for NE Scotland (i.e. Grampian and Tayside) and the region between the coast and the Eastern edge of the Pennines. Values between -7.0 to -8.0<bold>&#x2030;</bold> are estimated for East Anglia, and individuals from Great Chesterford should be closer to -7.5&#x2030; [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, the equivalent drinking water estimates may suggest a childhood origin in NE Scotland, the Eastern edge of the Pennines or further East in continental Europe. The older geology of NE Scotland is incompatible with the measured Sr isotopes, and can be ruled out. Maps based on modern rainwater &#x3B4;O<sup>18</sup><sub>,</sub> show values of -8 to -9<bold>&#x2030;</bold> representing an approximately North-South strip of Europe running through Eastern France, Central Germany, Eastern Denmark, and small areas of non-coastal SW Norway [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Few of these areas have detailed Sr isotopic maps, but Sr isotopes from medieval burials in SW Norway show <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr consistently &gt;0.710 and as high as 0.730 making this area unlikely as an origin for GC96. In contrast, the well-characterized Sr geochemisty of Denmark [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] shows <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr in surface waters for most regions of Denmark predominantly in the range 0.708&#x2013;0.710, consistent with the values obtained for GC96. Sr analyses for Eastern France and Central Germany are not detailed enough to rule out an origin in either, and geologies certainly exist that would give isotopic values compatible with GC96.</p>

              <p>However, the conversion of measured &#x3B4;O<sup>18</sup> to equivalent drinking water is complicated by large regression uncertainties (estimated at &#xB1;1.0&#x2030;, 2&#x3C3; -) [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], so comparing isotopic measurement on teeth to rainwater is less than ideal and we should be careful not to over-interpret comparisons of &#x3B4;O<sup>18</sup> in rainwater with equivalent drinking water values. However, the uncertainties on the conversion of &#x3B4;O<sup>18</sup>

<sub>phosphate</sub> values to those measured directly on tooth enamel phosphate. Evans <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] give &#x3B4;O<sup>18</sup> phosphate values measured on 615 archaeological teeth on individuals of a presumed British origin. Of these only 39 have &#x3B4;O<sup>18</sup> phosphate &lt; = 16.6&#x2030;, or c.6% of individuals. Taking the maximum uncertainty on the carbonate to phosphate &#x3B4;O<sup>18</sup> conversion into account, 173 (28%) individuals have &#x3B4;O<sup>18</sup> phosphate &lt; = 17.2&#x2030;. So assuming Evans&#x2019; <italic>et al</italic>. analyses are representative of all British &#x3B4;O<sup>18</sup> values, the likelihood of GC96 being local to Britain lie between 28% and 6%, i.e. GC96 is most likely from somewhere on mainland Europe.</p>

        <title>1. The pathological lesions</title>
        <p>A number of conditions potentially responsible for the changes observed in GC96 are considered. Erosive arthopathies (EA) cause destruction of joints and the bones of the hands and feet are frequently affected. In particular, seronegative spondyloarthropathies may result in cup and peg deformities, ankylosis of inter-phalangeal joints, and subperiosteal proliferation in the foot and lower leg bones [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124282.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, new bone growth on the tibiae and fibulae is usually focused on soft tissue attachment areas [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], a pattern not observed in GC96. In addition, in seronegative spondyloarthropathy, other areas of the skeleton should be diseased, especially the vertebral and sacro-iliac joints [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Although the vertebrae were absent, the sacro-iliac joints in GC96 appeared normal.</p>
        <p>A consequence of diabetes is neuropathy, which can cause atrophy in the foot bones [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Of importance here is the concentric remodelling to the distal metatarsals and phalanges. Additionally, the loss of sensation and impaired circulation in diabetes favors infection in the foot. However prolonged survival with diabetes is unlikely in antiquity [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In addition, the age of onset for diabetes-related foot changes is usually over 40 years [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], so the young age of GC96 would also argue against this diagnosis.</p>
        <p>The destructive lesions of the metatarsals and phalanges, particularly the blade like deformity of the fifth metatarsal, the ankylosis of pedal phalanges and the form and distribution of the subperiosteal new bone proliferation on the tibiae and fibulae are typical of leprosy [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124282.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Although leprosy appears to be the most likely cause of the osteological lesions, the absence of the facial skeleton meant that the presence or otherwise of <italic>facies leprosa</italic>, could not be confirmed, so it was difficult to be certain of diagnosis. Hence biomolecular analysis was required to confirm the presence of the disease.</p>

        <title>2. Ancient DNA</title>
        <p>Comparison of leprosy genomes from diverse geographical regions and bioinformatics have led to the development of epidemiological tools, for both investigation of short-term transmission by family members as well as discerning global dissemination of leprosy in prehistory.</p>
        <p>Examination of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in strains recovered from regions where the disease is still endemic, showed that present-day cases of leprosy are derived from a clone of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> which probably originated in East Africa and spread with human movements around the world [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Using phylogenetically informative SNP polymorphisms from regions where the disease is still endemic, these workers firstly identified four main genotypes which were later extended into 16 subtypes, designated A to O [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Type 1 strains, belonging on the first branch, may be subdivided into isolates A-D, type 2 or second branch strains into E-H, third branch into I-M and lastly, fourth branch isolates into N and O strains. The latter show variation in two insertion/deletion loci (indels) and four homopolymeric tracts (HPT) rather than in SNP variability. Truman and co-workers [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] added yet more detail, showing variation within 3I strains in southern states of North America which could be categorized as either 3I-1 or 3I-2, depending on the nucleotide at position 1,527,026 (G in 3I-1 and C in 3I-2) and the number of copies of an 11 bp element within a region known as indel_17915.</p>
        <p>Bioarchaeological studies have begun to investigate the strains of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> responsible for the disease in the medieval period when leprosy was at its height in the UK and continental Europe. Retrieval of near complete genomes of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> from the early medieval period has provided evidence for ancestors of two of the above lineages in human remains, namely 2F and 3I-1 [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These studies have also found that some isolates previously recognised as type 3K more properly belong on a separate branch, now termed branch 0. The earlier phylogenetic model for global dissemination of the four main types and their interrelationship has therefore undergone some refinement in the light of findings from past outbreaks and more geographically separated modern samples. Type 3 isolates have emerged as being of particular interest as they are known to have been responsible for archaeological cases described in central Europe (Hungary, 3K, 3M), north Africa (genotype 3) as well as central Asia (Uzbekistan, 3L) and western Asia (Turkey, 3K). The refined phylogeny of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> indicates parallel evolution of the five main branches diverging from a common ancestor at some point estimated to be around 2,500 years ago [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] rather than as a result of serial progression of types 1 to 4 by the most parsimonious route of single nucleotide polymorphism. Further work is needed to clarify the relationship between the type 3 strains and the recently identified branch 0, which includes at least some of the type 3K isolates.</p>
        <p>The subject of the present study, GC96, was infected with a strain belonging on the 3I lineage. Modern 3I-1 isolates display T and G bases at nucleotide positions 7,614 and 1,113,926 respectively. In GC96, the SNPs were T and A respectively. This appears to be an intermediate genotype between what would be expected from other type 3 strains (C and A) and implies that this individual was infected with a strain which may have been ancestral to modern 3I exemplars. The strain type has little bearing on the pathogenesis or severity of disease, as this is dictated by the immune response to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic>, but rather it may be helpful in understanding the origin of disease in the Anglo-Saxon period. Other type 3I cases have been reported from medieval Britain (Winchester and Ipswich), Denmark and Sweden [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124282.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. A Scandinavian origin for this lineage is therefore one possibility, given the proximity of the Anglo-Saxon tribal homelands in Northern Germany with Denmark. While the oxygen and strontium isotopic results can only give a broad and often ambiguous indication of childhood origin, the phosphate converted oxygen isotopes support a probable non-British origin for GC96, and albeit with a larger uncertainty, the drinking water equivalent values correspond to rainfall in parts of Germany and Denmark, though we cannot rule out with certainty an origin in France, or even a relatively small area of east central Britain.</p>
        <p>The 3I lineage is still found in southern states of the USA and was likely taken to the New World by early European settlers. Although the total evidence from the medieval period is limited to around a score of cases, it does seem that this genotype was one of two predominant lineages associated with the rise in disease in Britain at this time. There is also evidence to suggest that the 3I lineage was present in Britain much later in the timeline of European leprosy, which had begun to decline by this time [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. We have previously reported this lineage in a case from 13<sup>th</sup>-16<sup>th</sup> century Ipswich, Suffolk, UK [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Given persistence of the 3I lineage over nearly 800 years, it seems unlikely that a change in genetic make-up of the bacillus was responsible for the decline in European leprosy. This was supported by comparison of present day 3I whole genomes with those recovered from both Winchester and Scandinavia [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] which revealed remarkably high degrees of conservation amongst the ancient and modern strains.</p>

        <title>3. Lipid Biomarker Analysis</title>
        <p>Excellent mycocerosate profiles, typical of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0124282.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>), were conclusive confirmation for the presence of leprosy in GC96. In particular, major amounts of C<sub>34</sub> mycocerosate, accompanied by lesser proportions of C<sub>33</sub> mycocerosate, are decisive leprosy biomarkers [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. A particular diagnostic feature is the chromatographic overlap of the pentamethyl-branched C<sub>33</sub> mycocerosate with the tetramethyl-branched C<sub>32</sub> mycocerosate. The lack of any C<sub>27</sub> mycolipenate correlates with the absence of tuberculosis infection [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124282.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The excellent mycocerosate profiles (<xref rid="pone.0124282.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>) support earlier suggestions [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124282.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] that the very hydrophobic phthiocerol dimycocerosate waxes are exceptionally stable, with the potential to persist far back into antiquity.</p>
        <p>Mycolic acid profiles (<xref rid="pone.0124282.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0124282.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>) were not so decisive, with evidence for considerable degradation. The initial reverse phase HPLC profiles of total mycolates (<xref rid="pone.0124282.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0124282.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>) were clear and strong for the metatarsal extract, but progressively weaker for the talus and fibula samples. The positions of the peaks were consistent across all three specimens, but they did not correspond precisely to those for modern standard <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0124282.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Normal phase HPLC allows separation of the individual classes of mycolic acids, which in the case of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> are the so-called &#x3B1;-mycolates and ketomycolates [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; methoxymycolates, characteristic of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>, are absent. In the present examples, normal phase HPLC (<xref rid="pone.0124282.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>) gave clear peaks only for &#x3B1;-mycolates. Particularly, in the case of the talus extract, it was possible to discern two minor peaks, eluting after the &#x3B1;-mycolates (<xref rid="pone.0124282.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>), so fractions of these potential biomarkers were collected from all three normal phase separations for reverse phase HPLC investigation. The &#x3B1;-mycolate class gave good clean reverse phase profiles for the metatarsal and talus extracts, with a weak trace for the fibula (<xref rid="pone.0124282.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Fig</xref>). Significantly, the extracted &#x3B1;-mycolates from GC 96 are two carbons shorter than those of standard <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic>. Since clean profiles are recorded, the &#x3B1;-mycolates would not appear to have suffered extensive diagenetic degradation, so an explanation must await the analysis of a greater number of archaeological samples.</p>
        <p>Insignificant traces are recorded for components corresponding to ketomycolates (<xref rid="pone.0124282.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1E Fig</xref>), suggesting that any such mycolates have been degraded beyond recognition. Selective diagenetic degradation of ketomycolates has been previously observed in ancient leprosy skeletons (Sk7, Sk19) from Winchester [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and other tuberculosis and leprosy cases [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. As noted above, methoxymycolates have not been characterized from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic>, but in a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] reverse phase HPLC analysis of fractions eluting in the region expected for methoxymycolates in normal phase HPLC separations, showed the presence of minor components of unknown significance in two skeletons (Sk7, Sk8). Again, in the present study, extracts of the metatarsal and talus revealed the presence of two very weak peaks (<xref rid="pone.0124282.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Fig</xref>). Further studies will be required to determine if such minor components have biomarker potential, but it is important not to overlook their presence. Indeed, in standard <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> the presence of some very minor components is indicated, but these do not correspond to those in the metatarsal and talus specimens (<xref rid="pone.0124282.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Fig</xref>).</p>
        <p>The Great Chesterford case is thus of particular interest in understanding the origins of leprosy in the British Isles, being one of the earliest radiocarbon dated cases with supportive DNA evidence and genotyping of the isolate. The earliest purported example of leprosy from Britain that has been described in the published literature dates from the 3<sup>rd</sup>-4<sup>th</sup> century AD and comes from Poundbury, Dorset [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This burial comprises lower leg and foot bones only. Although these show changes that are compatible with leprosy, the presence or otherwise of the more firmly diagnostic facial changes could not be ascertained, so the diagnosis is controversial [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The first cases of leprosy in Britain showing diagnostic facial signs date from the early Anglo-Saxon period (<xref rid="pone.0124282.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>).</p>

Cases from continental Europe are known from Italy from the 2<sup>nd</sup>-3<sup>rd</sup> century AD [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] and the 5<sup>th</sup> century AD [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] and, north of the Alps, from Halland, Sweden (AD70-560) [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] and Lauchheim, Baden-W&#xFC;rttemberg, Germany (AD450-680) [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], and a very early case (4<sup>th</sup> millennium BC) has recently been suggested from Hungary [<xref rid="pone.0124282.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Once more European and Middle Eastern archaeological cases are genotyped, the results of this research will be important for understanding the spread of leprosy and any significant relationship that might exist between European and Middle Eastern strains.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Pathological lesions of a 5<sup>th</sup> &#x2013; 6<sup>th</sup> century male from Great Chesterford, Essex (GC96), were compatible with, but not pathognomonic of leprosy. Subsequent DNA and lipid biomarker analysis confirmed the presence of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic>. Additionally, genotyping showed GC96 to have a strain of the 3I lineage, but likely ancestral to present day exemplars. The 3I lineage is associated with LL cases in Medieval England, Denmark and Sweden, but also later emerged in the Americas, where it persists in southern states. As Sr and O stable isotope ratios suggest that GC96 was likely to be non-local to the region, the evidence suggests that this lineage could have been bought to England as early as the 5<sup>th</sup> century. Accordingly, considering the early medieval population movements in north Western Europe at this time, this research potentially supports the notion of a Scandinavian origin for the 3I strain which emerged in Britain. This multidisciplinary research adds considerable detail to the evolution of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> and helps us begin to piece together the possible rise in prevalence of leprosy in the context of population movements in the Anglo-Saxon period.</p>

          <p>Negative ion chemical ionization gas chromatography mass spectrometry (NICI-GCMS) was carried out at Swansea University. The instruments were a Thermo Scientific DSQII Mass Spectrometer coupled to a Thermo Scientific TRACE GC Ultra gas chromatograph. A Phenomenex Zebron ZB-5 (5% phenyl, 95% dimethylpolysiloxane) capillary column (30 m &#xD7; 0.25 mm i.d. &#xD7; 0.25 &#x3BC;m film thickness), using He as carrier gas (constant flow mode 1.2 ml min-1) and ammonia as the CI reagent gas, was used. An initial GC oven temperature of 200&#xB0;C was increased to 300&#xB0;C at a gradient of 17.5&#xB0;C min<sup>-1</sup>, the final temperature being held for 17.5 min. The ion source temperature was 170&#xB0;C. The injector used was a programmable temperature vapourising injector, which started at 50&#xB0;C for 0.2 min and increased to 300&#xB0;C at a rate of 10&#xB0;C s<sup>-1</sup> where it stayed for 0.5 min.
