      <abstract>
        <p>External Cervical Resorption in maxillary canines with pulp vitality is frequently
associated with dental trauma resulting from surgical procedures carried out to
prepare the teeth for further orthodontic traction. Preparation procedures might
surgically manipulate the cementoenamel junction or cause luxation of teeth due to
applying excessive force or movement tests beyond the tolerance limits of periodontal
ligament and cervical tissue structures. Dentin exposure at the cementoenamel
junction triggers External Cervical Resorption as a result of inflammation followed
by antigen recognition of dentin proteins. External Cervical Resorption is painless,
does not induce pulpitis and develops slowly. The lesion is generally associated with
and covered by gingival soft tissues which disguise normal clinical aspects, thereby
leading to late diagnosis when the process is near pulp threshold. Endodontic
treatment is recommended only if surgical procedures are rendered necessary in the
pulp space; otherwise, External Cervical Resorption should be treated by conservative
means: protecting the dental pulp and restoring function and esthetics of teeth whose
pulp will remain in normal conditions. Unfortunately, there is a lack of
well-grounded research evincing how often External Cervical Resorption associated
with canines subjected to orthodontic traction occurs.</p>

    <p>A simple case may provide the orthodontic science with fruitful ideas. Insights are
recurrent as the reality is dynamic: the needs of the past are no longer the needs of the
present. In the health sciences, scientific information acquires historical value within
five years, as they are owned by public domain and replaced by new ones. In some fields of
study, such as chemistry, physics and information science; knowledge and reality are
updated so fast that paper journals cannot follow their pace: Within six years, up-to-date
knowledge completely changes these fields of study. Likewise, social changes are so
increasingly fast that the current orthodontic reality is no longer comparable to that of
five years ago. </p>
    <p>In the present study we report a case that serves as an example not only to highlight the
clinical meaning of External Cervical Resorption, but also to discuss the parameters
established for differential diagnosis and some preventative measures that should be taken
to prevent the condition from happening in surgical practice!</p>
    <sec>
      <title>A case report: An insight</title>
      <p>After seven years of orthodontic treatment, a 27-year-old patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig 1</xref>) presented with chief complaint of slight gingival alteration
and unpleasant taste in the cervical region of painless left maxillary canine.</p>

</p>
      <p>Panoramic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig 2</xref>) and periapical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig 3</xref>) radiographs revealed radiolucent lesion in the
cervical region of the buccodistal surface of the canine. The condition was confirmed by
tomographic slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Fig 4</xref>) and 3D images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig 5</xref>). The lesion was deep and located near pulp
threshold. Nevertheless, gingival tissues were close to normality in spite of discreet
red macule in the papilla overlaying the resorptive lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

    <sec>
      <title>Identifying the cause</title>
      <p>The patient reported having undergone orthodontic traction seven years before without
surgical luxation. The patient also stated not remembering any episode of dental trauma
in the affected tooth. </p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Diagnostic discussion</title>
      <p>In the vast majority of cases, even those requiring CT scans, the pulp threshold remains
preserved in the areas corresponding to External Cervical Resorption lesion. The clasts
absorbing hard tissues do not attach to soft tissues, as it is the case of predentin.
Whenever they meet it, they move laterally and subsequently mineralize, thereby
preserving the integrity of pulp space and pulp for long periods of time.</p>
      <p>In many cases, however, pulp threshold is extremely thin and little mineralized, which
results in lack of imaginologic signs as in the case presented herein. Considering that
the tooth was painless and responded positive to sensitivity testing, it is reasonable
to assume the existence of a preserved pulp threshold even if by a thin dentin or
predentin layer. Even the most intense and deep resorptive processes do not lead to
pulpitis or inflammation of dental pulp. As a result, they do not evince any painful
symptoms.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Adopted protocol: Conservative treatment with pulp protection</title>
      <p>In view of normal gingival conditions and proved pulp vitality, and after identifying
the cause that no longer acted, but nurtured a process that needed to be interrupted,
the protocol of choice was functional and esthetic restoration aimed at preserving the
pulp and covering it with calcium hydroxide-based material. Three months have passed
after the procedure was carried out. Patient's tooth presents in normal conditions in
terms of esthetics and function without symptoms or color alterations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f06">Figs 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f07">7</xref>).</p>

      <title>Differential diagnosis</title>
      <p>
<italic>Cervical caries:</italic> It usually causes exposure of the root surface as a
result of gingival recession, with dark and irregular decay advancing towards the tooth
crown. In cases of External Cervical Resorption, decay is not dark and is usually
covered or hidden by gingival tissues which overlays surface mineralized structures.</p>
      <p>
<italic>Abrasion: </italic>A V-shaped lesion with regular surface and ridge exposed to
the oral cavity. When in the cervical region, it is generally associated with improper
tooth brushing. It is hardly ever found in one tooth only.</p>
      <p>
<italic>Abfraction:</italic> Cervical enamel microfractures with small, hard-wall
lesions without dark pigmentation. Lesions are exposed to the oral cavity as a result of
gingival recession.</p>
      <p>
<italic>Erosion: </italic>Lesions exposed to the oral cavity caused by chemical
dissolution not of bacterial origin. Lesions are normally saucer-shaped and smooth,
present a direct cause-and-effect relationship and affect several teeth instead of just
one. </p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>What is the clinical meaning of External Cervical Resorption?</title>
      <p>All cases of External Cervical Resorption in teeth with pulp vitality are caused by
dental trauma, whether accidental or surgically induced.</p>
      <p>Dental trauma, particularly mild ones, might cause focal lesions to connective tissue
related to the cervical region of the root and its gingival connective attachment. That
is where the cementoenamel junction is. In this region, along the tooth border, the
cementum might overlap the enamel, cementum and enamel might abut each other or there
might be a space or a gap between the enamel and the cementum where the dentin is
exposed to the gingival connective tissue. These three variations in the relationship
among enamel, cementum and dentin exist in all permanent and deciduous human teeth, and
vary according to the site of the tooth border examined.</p>
      <p>Provided that it occurs without migration of junctional epithelium, gingival tissue
inflammation ends up exposing the dentin in the gaps to antigen recognition/immunologic
cells which recognize kidnapped or hidden dentin proteins.</p>
      <p>With an exudate rich in enzymes, gingival inflammation dissolves the gelled
extracellular matrix of the connective tissue which protects or tenuously covers the
dentin exposed in the gaps, thereby preventing contact between the dentin and protein
recognition macrophages. In the event of antigen recognition of dentin proteins,
immunologic response promotes dentin removal, thereby leading to Enamel Cervical
Resorption.</p>
      <p>Cases in which the patient does not recall dental trauma are usually cases of dental
concussion characterized by not promoting increase of tooth mobility. In these cases,
should there be any symptoms, they are mild and only last for a few hours. This type of
mild dental trauma might be caused as a result of bumping against toys, punch, body
contact during sports practice, falls and other daily activities. After a few hours,
people rarely remember about the concussion.</p>
      <p>As for erupted maxillary canines, the consequences of concussion might not be as serious
due to teeth extensive root base at periodontal attachment. Concussion alterations only
occur in maxillary canine when they are highly severe. Nevertheless, they are more
common in central and maxillary lateral incisors.</p>
      <p>Cases of External Cervical Resorption in maxillary canines should be immediately related
to transoperative dental trauma instead of accidental trauma:</p>
      <p>
<bold>1. During bracket/button bonding procedures or enamel perforation.</bold> During
bracket/button bonding procedures or enamel perforation, surgeons usually remove the
pericoronal follicle up to its cervical attachment. As a result, they inevitably end up
manipulating the cementoenamel junction in an improper way; thereby directly exposing
the dentin to macrophages in the cervical connective tissue. The process of External
Cervical Resorption starts slowly and might only be revealed by imaging or clinical
examinations when the tooth is already present in the dental arch. </p>
      <p>
<bold>2. Alveolodental luxation surgically assisted or not by the orthodontist.</bold>
During procedures of surgically-assisted luxation or manual/instrument movement tests,
the tooth undergoes <bold>significant</bold> movement/displacement. For 0.25-mm thick
periodontal tissue, these movements represent a true transoperative dental trauma and
lead to similar consequences as those caused by accidental trauma. The process of
External Cervical Resorption starts slowly and might only be revealed by imaging or
clinical examinations when the tooth is already present in the dental arch. </p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>How can we prevent External Cervical Resorption in maxillary canines potentially
subjected to orthodontic traction?</title>
      <p>In general terms, External Cervical Resorption is prevented by avoiding accidental
dental trauma. Although the use of a mouthpiece is not widely spread in Dentistry and
within the overall population, it should be mandatory during sports practice and leisure
activities. Most dental professionals are unaware of mouthpieces and the benefits
provided by their routine use in certain situations.</p>
      <p>In the event of External Cervical Resorption induced by transoperative dental trauma,
some important measures must be taken: </p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>
<bold>1. </bold>
<bold>During bracket/button bonding procedures or enamel perforation </bold>carried out
for orthodontic traction purposes, the orthodontist must interact with the surgeon so as
to:</title>
      <p>
<bold>a) While opening up a space or "gap" </bold>in the pericoronal follicle so as to
have access to the enamel, do not remove soft tissues up to the cervical region where
they are attached. Leave a 1 to 2-mm strip of soft tissue in order to avoid unwanted
manipulation of the cementoenamel junction.</p>
      <p>
<bold>b) During enamel acid etching</bold>: should it be the technique of choice to
prepare the surface receiving resin and bracket/button, avoid material overflow in the
cervical region as it might act on the cementoenamel junction and, as a result, expose
it and increase the size of dentin gaps. </p>
      <p>2. In the event of surgically-assisted luxation for orthodontic traction, some important
measures must be taken together with the surgeon:</p>
      <p>a) Surgically-assisted luxation should not be carried out <bold>unless it is requested
by the orthodontist.</bold> It should be evinced that orthodontic traction of
unerupted teeth without alveolodental ankylosis does not require previous luxation.
<bold>Emphasize:</bold> Surgically preparing a tooth for orthodontic traction is one
procedure, surgically-assisted alveolodental luxation is something completely different,
carried out in a distinct moment.</p>
      <p>b) Whenever surgically-assisted luxation is <bold>recommended by the
orthodontist</bold>, the surgical procedures carried out for alveolodental luxation
should be as delicate as possible particularly because the periodontal ligament is on
average 0.25-mm thick, as thin as a paper sheet.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>c)<bold> Movement/displacement testing </bold>during alveolodental luxation surgery
should be extremely delicate so as to avoid dental trauma of which consequences include
External Cervical Resorption.</title>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Final considerations</title>
      <p>This case report motivated us to question the following in epidemiological terms:</p>
      <p>
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>"</label><p>How many cases (%) of teeth subjected to orthodontic traction present External
Cervical Resorption as a consequence of the therapy of choice?</p></list-item><list-item><label>"</label><p>How many of these cases (%) are associated with surgical procedures of
bracket/button placement or enamel perforation for orthodontic wire
installation, only?</p></list-item><list-item><label>"</label><p>How many of these cases (%) are associated with procedures of
surgically-assisted alveolodental luxation, only?</p></list-item></list>
</p>
      <p>There are significant case reports allowing these data to be analyzed so as to enlighten
the orthodontic practice! May these insights disturb all and let research begin.</p>
