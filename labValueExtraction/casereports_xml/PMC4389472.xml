      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Penetrating cardiac trauma still carries high mortality rates, even with immediate
medical attention and advanced medical evacuation services. The nature of the injury
itself, the involvement of an organ as vital as the heart as well as rapid clinical
deterioration all cooperate to unfavorable outcomes in both prehospital and inhospital
environments. In addtion, the rampant growth of urban violence and increased access of
civilians to firearms have contributed to the increased incidence of penetrating cardiac
injuries <sup>[<xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p>
      <p>Although accidental injuries constitute a very small part of penetrating cardiac
injuries, they are still serious. In this paper, we present an unusual case of
penetrating cardiac injury caused by a metal fragment that broke off from one of the
blades of a grass-cutting tool. The fragment caused transfixing lesions in the stomach,
diaphragm, and heart and lodged itself in the lungs. All lesions were repaired. The
patient had an uneventful postoperative course and 2 years after surgery he is still
asymptomatic.</p>

      <title>CLINICAL CASE</title>
      <p>This work was performed after informed consent from the patient and approval of the
Ethics Committee of the Santa Casa de Londrina Hospital (Londrina, PR, Brazil).</p>
      <p>A 23-year-old male patient was referred to the emergency department of the Santa Casa de
Londrina Hospital with perforating wound by a metallic artifact (shrapnel) in the
thoracoabdominal face. The shrapnel, according to witnesses and the victim himself,
broke off from a blade of the grass-cutting tool he was operating while working in the
middle of a highway. Signs of hemodynamic instability started during transport to the
hospital, with hypotension and confusion upon admission.</p>
      <p>Support measures were initiated immediately after his entry. Chest radiography showed a
solid fragment lodged in the heart projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure
1A</xref>), and computed tomography showed possible heart damage due to myocardial
tapering in ventricular apex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1B</xref>) and
presence of a small volume pneumoperitoneum. According to computed tomography images and
reconstruction of the trajectory, the shrapnel transfixed the ventricular apex and
lodged itself in the lower lobe of the left lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure
1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">D</xref>).</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Faced with a possible cardiac injury, imminent hemodynamic collapse, and presence of
intra-abdominal injuries, the patient was referred to surgical exploration. The access
to the chest cavity was obtained by left anterolateral thoracotomy and soon after its
opening lots of blood and food debris were observed, as well as injuries to diaphragm
and lower lobe of the left lung.</p>
      <p>The cavity was washed and the diaphragmatic hole was closed by continuous suture. After
pericardial dissection we observed two sources of active bleeding (inlet and outlet) in
topography ventricular apex, one anteriorly and the other posteriorly. The lesions were
punctate and it was possible to fix them without the use of extracorporeal circulation
by directly suturing the wounds with 2.0 polyester sutures with pledges. After removal
of the fragment lodged in the lung the injury was repaired by continuous suture with
polyglactin 910 3.0. The diaphragmatic injury, previously closed by continuous suture,
was repaired again with interposition of a bovine pericardial patch.</p>
      <p>We also performed an exploratory laparotomy, which revealed a large amount of food
debris, a transfixing injury in the stomach, and no lesions in other organs. The gastric
injury was repaired by direct suture and the abdominal cavity was subjected to profuse
washes before its closure, in accordance with standard technique. The patient had an
uneventful postoperative course and was discharged 11 days after admission. He has been
asymptomatic for 2 years since surgery, without the use of medication. At follow-up,
routine exams showed no changes: echocardiography with preserved ventricular function,
normal left ventricular segmental contractility, heart valves with good opening and
mobility, atrial and ventricular septal integrity, and an ejection fraction of 66%;
ergometric test without evidence of ischemia; and chest CT angiography with only
remnants of a repaired myocardial injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure
2</xref>).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The heart, a vital organ protected by the thoracic cage, rarely suffers penetrating
injuries. Penetrating cardiac injuries had been considered lethal for centuries, with
sporadic clinical observations suggesting possible survival, until in 1896 Rehn
demonstrated the feasibility of suturing a heart wound <sup>[<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Nevertheless, it was Harken who during World War II,
compiled an impressive number of 130 soldiers operated on due to cardiac lesions by
shrapnel, with no deaths recorded <sup>[<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.
In Brazil, the first successful sutures of a cardiac injury were performed by Brauner in
1927, and Zerbini in 1942, who operated on a 6-year-old boy who was hit by metallic
shrapnel in the precordium and suffered an injury in the anterior descending coronary
artery, marking the first steps of Brazilian heart surgery <sup>[<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p>
      <p>Despite the historical importance of cardiac trauma in the development of medicine,
heart penetrating wounds are rarely seen in emergency rooms, since most victims do not
survive the complications of trauma prior to admission. Death usually results from
cardiac tamponade or exsanguination, conditions that lead to death within minutes if not
diagnosed and treated in time. Therefore, little is known about real mortality rates -
prehospital mainly - of penetrating cardiac injuries <sup>[<xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. The most
frequent causes are injuries caused by knives and guns, mainly due to increasing urban
violence <sup>[<xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p>
      <p>Penetrating trauma caused by these weapons usually affect the right ventricle, which
lies in the anterior chest wall, followed by left ventricle and right atrium,
respectively <sup>[<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. Injuries caused by
objects other than those mentioned above - like needles, shards, splinters, bone
fragments, and surgical artifacts - are commonly associated with unintended injuries,
and can result from iatrogenic complications during invasive procedures <sup>[<xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p>
      <p>In the case patient described in this report, the small size, pointed shape, high speed
and punctiform area of the the metal inflicted against the tissues of the victim induced
the shrapnel to act as a projectile triggered from a reduced distance, with an upward
trend, reaching and transfixing the myocardium but without the explosive capacity
characteristic of a gun projectile. It is likely that the severity of the cardiac damage
was mitigated by the low energy dissipated by the artifact. In addiction, the
ventricular myocardium may have staunched the bleeding partially and temporarily.</p>
      <p>Penetrating heart injuries configure not only a challenge against time for emergency
medical services, but also a scenario of difficult diagnosis since their clinical
presentation may vary from a stable and innocent condition to extreme hemodynamic
collapse and potential catastrophic outcome. As for the surgeons, they need to become
familiar with the possibility of cardiac lesions in cases of penetrating injuries in the
thoracic region, specifically in the area located between the clavicles, the costal
margin, and the hemi-clavicular lines ("cardiac box") <sup>[<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p>
      <p>However, in less conventional situations or in certain traumatisms resulted from
peculiar kinematics, cardiac lesions may require more precise tests to be diagnosed.
Among the less common causes of cardiac trauma, foreign bodies, such as fragments or
shrapnel, represent a small portion of accident statistics for these objects. A study
conducted by Vollman et al. <sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> in
the pediatric population in the period of 1990-2004 showed lesions in extremities were
the most frequent injuries involving grass-cutting tool machinery. According to the
study, they were mostly due to direct contact with the blades, with less than 10% of the
lesions being associated with foreign objects thrown or given off by these machines, and
there were no cases of cardiac injury.</p>
      <p>We found only two reports of two patients who suffered cardiac wounds due to similar
artifacts to the one from our patient. In both cases, the right ventricle was affected
and immediate surgical correction was successful <sup>[<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="conclusions">
      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>Immediate medical care, accurate diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention are crucial
to favorable outcomes in patients with heart penetrating injuries. In some peculiar
cases, diagnosis can be difficult and may require more precise exams and subsequent
surgical correction, as in the case presented here.</p>
