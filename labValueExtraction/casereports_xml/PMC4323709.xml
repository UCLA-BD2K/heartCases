        <p>Skin infections by <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> are quite rare in our
environment and, therefore, little studied. The majority of the lesions appear
three weeks after traumas in aquariums, beaches and fish tanks. Lymph node
drainage and systematization of the disease are rare and most lesions disappear
in about three years. This case aims to show the effectiveness of the treatment
used (lymecycline 150 mg/orally/day). This medication may be a new therapeutic
option for the treatment of <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic>.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>In 1926, while examining dead fish, Aronson found tuber bacilli inside them. These
bacilli were different from those already described and were named
<italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic>.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In 1954, Linell and Norden described M. marinum as a cause of human skin infection
for the first time. These lesions resembled tuberculosis verrucae cutis and are
characterized by papules, nodules and ulcers with or without exudation.<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The majority of the lesions appear
three weeks after traumas in aquariums, beaches, fish tanks. Lymph node drainage and
systemization of the disease are rare and most lesions disappear in about three
years.</p>
      <p>Histological examination reveals granulomatous inflammation with epithelial cells,
giant cells, caseous necrosis and abscesses.</p>
      <p>As to epidemiology, the largest reported epidemic occurred in Colorado, United
States, with 290 cases being described by Philpott et al.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The majority of infections occur on the back of hands, fingers and elbows. The
lesions may initially be solitary or multiple nodules, progress to ulceration and,
finally, become exuding wounds. Satellite lesions occur frequently and, in some
cases, are raised like lymphangitic sporotrichosis.</p>
      <p>The best way to cultivate <italic>Mycobacterium marinium</italic> is between 86 and
91,4&#xB0; F, in Lowenstein Jensen medium.<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The colonies become visible in 8-14 days. The examination of the
culture of this mycobacterium has important characteristics because they are
photochromic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). In the dark they are
white and when exposed to light they become yellow or orange. Positive tuberculin
reaction happens in 82% of the cases.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="abd-90-01-0117-g01"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Winter and Runyon made an important consideration on <italic>M. marinum</italic>
since it can parasitize fish, cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals, including
humans, showing a significant variation in the capacity of their habitat.<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, inflammatory granuloma, lymphocytes, histiocytes,
epithelioid cells and Langerhans cells characterize the histology.</p>
      <p>The main differential diagnoses are tuberculosis verrucosa cutis, sporotrichosis,
leishamaniasis, verruca vulgaris, tularemia, nocardiosis, blastomycosis,
coccidioidomycosis, tumors and others.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>An 18 year-old single white female patient, born and raised in Pelotas, southern
Brazil, reported having suffered slight scratches on the back of her right hand
(while cleaning the glass wall of an aquarium). The fish that lived there died a
week later. After three months, she noticed the lesion was difficult to heal and,
after using many medications, including antibiotics, she sought medical care from a
specialist. The dermatological examination revealed two ulcerated nodular lesions
with abundant exudate located on the middle finger and on the back of the right
hand, with the presence of nodular type satellite on the wrist of the same hand,
resembling a sporotrichoid infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure
2</xref>). Physical examination found no other changes.</p>
      <fig id="f02" orientation="portrait" position="float">

        </caption>
        <graphic xlink:href="abd-90-01-0117-g02"/>
      </fig>
      <p>In the laboratory investigation, material was collected for skin testing for fungus
and bacteria, as well as skin fragment for a biopsy. Mycological examination was
negative. On the other hand, bacteriologic test was positive after 10 days, with
growth of mycobacterium that, according to photochromic characteristics, was
identified as <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic>. The histological report was
descriptive, showing granulomatous inflammatory infiltrate with giant cells, mixed
inflammatory cells and the presence of necrosis, suggestive of granulomatous
disease. It is known that tetracyclines are an alternative therapy for
mycobacteriosis. We chose to start treatment with one drug of this class,
lymecycline 150mg/orally/day, due to history of gastritis triggered by previous
antibiotic treatments, since this drug is better tolerated. After 10 days of
treatment, she had clear signs of lesion improvement and we chose to keep the
treatment and reevaluate after 45 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure
3</xref>). After this period, the patient returned to the clinic with total
remission of lesions; we decided then to suspend all medication and discharged the
patient, in view of the good development, thereby obtaining a clinical cure.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Infection caused by <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> is quite rare in our
country, therefore it has been little studied. In the case discussed, the contagion
was in a domestic aquarium, and it is a warning for special care when handling this
type of container, in view of the Brazilian habit of manipulating fish in aquariums.
We stress the importance of this case because it had a great therapeutic response to
low doses of lymecycline (150mg/orally/day), since the usual dose for adults with
other conditions is 300 mg daily. Resistance to antibiotics and chemotherapy
characterizes mycobacterial infections. Several studies have reported long treatment
periods ranging from several months to years using the traditional
medications.<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> There are
also reports of increased resistance to therapy when there is sporotrichoid
lymphangitic dissemination, when usually are used antitubercular multiple drug
treatments, as rifampicin and ethambutol.<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> We suggest further studies for possible inclusion of
lymecycline in the therapeutic arsenal for treating these mycobacteria, since the
dosage is simple, there is low rate of adverse reactions and excellent digestive
tolerance.</p>
