      <abstract>
        <p>We report the case of a 2-year-old child who survived an acute episode of
severe spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage with clinical and radiological
signs of intracranial hypertension and transtentorial herniation. The
patient underwent emergency surgery to drain the hematoma, and a catheter
was inserted to monitor intracranial pressure. In the initial computed
tomography analysis performed prior to hematoma drainage, a brain cyst was
evident contralateral to the hematoma, which, based on the analysis by the
care team, possibly helped to avoid a worse outcome because the cyst
accommodated the brain after the massive hemorrhage. After the
investigation, the patient was determined to have previously undiagnosed
hemophilia A. The patient underwent treatment in intensive care, which
included the control of intracranial pressure, factor VIII replacement and
discharge without signs of neurological impairment.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Severe acute intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a life-threatening event associated
with high morbidity and mortality.<sup>(<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</sup> It is also
associated with an acute increase in intracranial pressure (ICP); as the
hematoma increases, the ICP rises, causing non-specific symptoms, such as
headache, nausea, vomiting, and changes in the consciousness level. ICH
expansion may result in transtentorial herniation, causing neurological
deterioration and loss of pupillary reflex.<sup>(<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup> Seizures are common in cases of ICH in pediatric
patients.<sup>(<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>We report the case of a 2-year-old child who presented with an acute episode of
severe ICH with intracranial hypertension signs. The cause of ICH was determined
to be hemophilia A. In this case, a brain cyst evident on the initial computed
tomography scan caught our attention. The care team hypothesized that the cyst
was responsible for minimizing the ICP and preventing serious consequences due
to transtentorial herniation.</p>
      <p>The patient underwent hematoma drainage and ICP monitoring in the intensive care
unit (ICU) and received factor VIII administration. The patient was discharged
with no obvious neurological sequelae.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 2-year-old child, 12kg, male, of Japanese descent, with a complaint of
drowsiness for one day was evaluated in the emergency room. The patient had no
history of previous hospitalizations or comorbidities and had an updated
vaccination record. The parents did not report any prevalent disease in the
family. In the initial evaluation, the patient was sleepy, pallor +/4, eupneic,
afebrile, responding to tactile stimuli with crying, and had a blood pressure of
100 x 40mmHg and 130mg% blood glucose levels. Volume replacement was prescribed
at 20mL/kg with 0.9% saline, and laboratory tests were performed upon admission.
The initial diagnosis was exogenous intoxication, although the parents denied
any possibility of such.</p>
      <p>While under clinical observation in the emergency department, the patient
presented with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure with lip cyanosis and a
decrease in oxygen saturation to 94%, lasting for approximately 1 minute. The
treating physician described the patient as unresponsive to verbal stimuli,
without spontaneous eye opening, mydriatic left pupil not photoresponsive,
isochoric right pupil with ipsilateral and contralateral photoreaction, without
meningeal signs. Emergency computed tomography of the skull was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>), where subdural hemorrhage was
evident, bypassing the left brain hemisphere. This hemorrhage was heterogeneous,
with apparent active bleeding, exhibiting an estimated maximum thickness of
approximately 2.7cm in the frontal region, exerting remarkable compression on
the neighboring brain parenchyma, promoting a midline shift to the right by
approximately 1.9cm at the level of the septum pellucidum with signs of
subfalcine herniation of the cingulate gyrus, and transtentorial descending and
lateral (uncal and parahippocampal) herniation, significantly compressing the
midbrain. The dimensions of the second and fourth ventricles were significantly
reduced in size due to the compressive effect of the brain herniation. The
computed tomography also revealed a cystic lesion, apparently a sequela,
compromising the right frontal lobe.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the patient's neurological condition deteriorated, and the Glasgow Coma
Scale score decreased to 6. The patient was intubated using rapid sequence
intubation, and mechanical ventilation was started. The neurosurgeon was
alerted, who proceeded to urgently drain the hematoma and install the ICP
catheter. The diagnostic tests upon admission revealed a prothrombin time of
13.4 seconds with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 0.97 and an
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 94 seconds (patient/normal
[P/N]: ratio 2.63). Other tests were within normal limits. The mother was asked
about previous bleeding and reported an occasion where, after the collection of
routine tests, the child presented with a significant hematoma at the puncture
site. At the time, he was advised to seek medical attention but did not.</p>
      <p>The patient was transferred to the pediatric ICU and remained on mechanical
ventilation, pressure controlled mode, using capnography, targeting carbon
dioxide tension at the end of expiration (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) between 35 and
45mmHg while also avoiding hyperoxia. He received sedoanalgesia with thiopental
(60mcg/kg/min), fentanyl (4mcg/kg/min) and midazolam (0.4mcg/kg/min). He also
received hidantal at a loading dose of 15mg/kg and a maintenance dose of
5mg/kg/day. He continued to receive noradrenaline (0.2mcg/kg/min) to maintain a
cerebral perfusion pressure between 40 and 65mmHg. A central catheter was
peripherally inserted in the right basilar vein, and a 4F double-lumen central
venous catheter was inserted in the right internal jugular vein. The patient
remained fasting, receiving isotonic maintenance fluids with 100mL/kcal and
basal electrolytes on the first day; on the second day, total parenteral
nutrition was started. The ICP was monitored to maintain it below 20mmHg.</p>
      <p>The tests were repeated and the results are as follows: INR at 0.99; aPTT at 80
seconds with a P/N ratio of 2.37; and fibrinogen at 328mg/dL (normal: 200 -
400mg/dL). The patient was evaluated by the pediatric hematology team, and
factor VIII (23%; normal: 57% - 192%) and factor VIII (undetectable) inhibitors
were measured, revealing a clinical picture of hemophilia A. We began immediate
intravenous administration of factor VIII.</p>
      <p>On the third day of hospitalization, we started to reduce thiopental aided by
continuous electroencephalography.</p>
      <p>The patient was successfully extubated on the 19<sup>th</sup> day of
hospitalization. He developed ptosis of the left eyelid. He gradually recovered
motor and intellectual abilities and spoke normally, and the ptosis decreased.
In the control computed tomography of the skull (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>), note the new brain architecture with re-accommodation of
the brain parenchyma without signs of hematomas. Currently, the patient is being
monitored at a specialized clinic for hemophilia patients.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Spontaneous ICH is associated with a high mortality and morbidity.<sup>(<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)</sup> The incidence is estimated at
24.6 cases per 100,000 people annually, with mortality rates of 40% at 1 month
and 54% at 1 year, with only 12% to 39% of patients recovering long-term
functional independence.<sup>(<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)</sup>
Spontaneous ICH is responsible for 50% of strokes in children, whereas it
accounts for only 15% of strokes in adults. In adults, hypertension is the most
common cause of ICH, whereas in children, secondary factors such as vascular
malformations cause ICH, although there are still few pediatric
studies.<sup>(<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)</sup> ICH is an
important cause of morbidity and mortality in hemophilia patients, with an
incidence ranging from 2.2 to 7.5%.<sup>(<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)</sup> Clotting factor replacement therapy, emergency
neurosurgery and rapid and appropriate airway management are essential in
comatose patients.<sup>(<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)</sup> A
multidisciplinary approach involving hematologists, neurosurgery and intensive
care personnel is crucial for achieving a favorable outcome. The decrease in
30-day mortality is likely related to the introduction of investigation
protocols, early diagnosis and management strategies for these patients,
including monitoring in ICU environments.<sup>(<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>In our case report, the patient was already presenting with signs of
transtentorial herniation on the initial computed tomography of the skull, given
the large extent of the hemorrhaging. Signs of neurological deterioration were
rapid, following increasingly severe degrees of drowsiness, seizures and
unilateral mydriasis. What was notable here and the consensus among the various
teams who assisted the patient was that the brain cyst accommodated the pressure
and prevented a more tragic outcome for the patient. There are reports of
patients with congenital blood dyscrasias who have presented with brain cysts
due to previous bleeding events that have been reabsorbed.<sup>(<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</sup> We suspect that this
patient's brain cyst may have originated from a prior bleeding event, possibly
even during the intrauterine period.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="conclusions">
      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>This report emphasizes the importance of the early recognition of signs of
intracranial hemorrhage in children, the pursuit of the underlying cause and
immediate treatment provided by the neurosurgical team, in addition to
monitoring in the intensive care unit using intracranial hemorrhage management
protocols. Sustained intracranial hemorrhage and cerebral herniation are
neurological emergencies. Similarly to cardiac arrest, a neurologic emergency
also demands an organized management algorithm for the care of critically ill
patients. The goal of having a neurologic emergency protocol is to establish
standardized evidence-based management for patients with intracranial hemorrhage
and/or transtentorial herniation.</p>
      <p>Thus, even with extensive intracranial hemorrhaging, the patient not only survived
a catastrophic event but also adequately regained his neurological functions. In
this case report, we would like to highlight computed tomography images of the
skull, in which a brain cyst seemed to accommodate the pressure caused by the
hematoma, helping to avoid a more dramatic outcome.</p>
