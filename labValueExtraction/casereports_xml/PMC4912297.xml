        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>The imaging finding of omental cake has been demonstrated in other modalities, such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonography. However, to the best of our knowledge, the image presentation of omental cake on a routine kidney-ureter-bladder film has not been reported before in the literature.</p>
        <p>We presented a unique case of a 61-year-old woman, with known advanced cecal colon mucinous adenocarcinoma, presented to our institution with abdominal fullness, poor appetite, and decreased stool passage for 20 days. Physical examination was unremarkable, except distended abdomen. Subsequent study revealed massive post-pigtail catheter drainage ascites with a prominent soft-tissue mass-causing centralization and tethering of focally distended small bowel gas, suggestive of omental cake on plain radiograph. The imaging finding in plain radiograph corresponds to the findings in other imaging modalities, including abdominal sonography and computed tomography. The patient underwent subtotal colectomy and ileostomy during later courses of chemotherapy due to adhesion ileus and possible intraabdominal abscess, and pathologic study confirmed the diagnosis of cecal mucinous adenocarcinoma and peritoneal carcinomatosis.</p>
        <p>Although the image finding of omental cake on plain radiograph has never been described, this image finding is unique and should be recognized, as it may suggest the presence of omental cake when first identified in the emergency department from patients with abdominal distension and warrant further evaluation to evaluate the underlying cause.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Omental cake, or diffuse peritoneal infiltration, occurs most commonly secondary to intraperitoneal tumor spread; other causes include primary malignancy, inflammatory conditions, and other less-common benign conditions.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The imaging finding of omental cake has been well demonstrated in other modalities, such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonography. Walkey et al <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> reviewed the computed tomography findings of 60 patients and reported the following common findings of peritoneal malignancy, including loculated or nonloculated ascites (most common), peritoneal thickening and enhancement, and bowel involvement, including distortion with or without obstruction.

      <title>CASE PRESENTATION</title>
      <p>The institutional review board (Chang Gung Memorial Hospital) approved this work and waived the need for inform consent. A 61-year-old woman with known advanced cecal colon mucinous adenocarcinoma presented to the emergency department with abdominal fullness, poor appetite, and decreased stool passage for 20 days. Tracing back to the history, she underwent chemotherapy due to peritoneal carcinomatosis detected on computed tomography. Physical examination was unremarkable, except distended abdomen. A kidney-ureter-bladder radiograph taken during treatment follow-up revealed massive post-pigtail catheter drainage ascites with a prominent soft-tissue mass-causing centralization and tethering of focally distended small bowel gas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). Abdominal computed tomography confirmed the corresponding finding of omental cake with a mass resulting in traction and encasement of the adjacent bowel, accompanied by massive ascites and peritoneal enhancement (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B), in which the centrally dilated bowel is correlated both in kidney-ureter-bladder radiograph and computed tomography (comparing Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A and B). Transabdominal ultrasonography revealed soft-tissue nodules and infiltration of bowel walls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C, D). The patient underwent subtotal colectomy and ileostomy during later courses of chemotherapy due to adhesion ileus and possible intraabdominal abscess. Patient tolerated the surgery well with resolution of intraabdominal abscess, improved appetite and constipation status. A pathologic study confirmed the diagnosis of cecal mucinous adenocarcinoma and peritoneal carcinomatosis with metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E and F).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Peritoneal carcinomatosis is the dissemination and implantation of tumor cells throughout the peritoneal cavity. Omental cake refers to soft tissue thickening of the omentum secondary to tumor seedings or omental fat infiltration.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> A previous study reported the occurrence of peritoneal carcinomatosis in 50% of patients with colorectal cancer and the peritoneal cavity as the only site of recurrence in up to 25% of patients.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Metastatic colon cancer can present as mucinous implants,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> as reported in our case, but such metastatic mucin-producing tumors may also originate from the ovary, uterus, gastrointestinal tract (appendix), and organs (pancreas).<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The typical imaging presentation of omental cake has been described as a thickened omentum with diffuse tumor infiltration in advanced peritoneal carcinomatosis.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> However, the differentiation of peritoneal carcinomatosis from adjacent soft tissue or bowel gas has not been reported by kidney-ureter-bladder radiograph alone. Thus, its diagnosis depends heavily on the findings of other imaging modalities, such as computed tomography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging, but these modalities are either much more expensive or more time consuming.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Other indirect evidence of omental metastases has been reported, such as the presence of ascites or extracellular mucin and mesenteric thickening.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> As described above, the findings of bowel tethering and distortion in the case described here with kidney-ureter-bladder film were due to loculated ascites with tumor encasement and infiltration along the small bowel, which is compatible with previously described computed tomography findings.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Omental vascular pedicle sign has been proposed in patients with metastatic or primary omental mass.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Our presented case shows omental cake with a massive ascites mass resulting in traction and encasement of the adjacent bowel, accompanied by peritoneal enhancement, although dilated omental vein was not observed. This could probably due to the omental cake formation in our patient was due to diffuse omental caking from metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma rather than the various pathologies proposed by Karcaaltincaba et al.</p>

      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>Our report presents the first known case of this imaging finding on a routine kidney-ureter-bladder radiograph. It may suggest the presence of omental cake when identified and warrant further evaluation to evaluate the underlying cause.</p>
