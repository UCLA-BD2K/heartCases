  <body>
    <p>A urethral stricture is a narrowing of the urethra caused by neoplasia, urethroliths and
trauma due to surgical injury or fracture [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The
clinical signs include stranguria, overflow incontinence and secondary detrusor atony [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Diagnosis is performed with a retrograde urethrography
or a urethroscopy. Surgery has commonly been used depending on the location of the stricture.
To date, however, both surgical and non-surgical treatment modalities have been reported to
treat the urethral stricture [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Extrapelvic strictures are corrected by an urethrostomy, but intrapelvic
ones are managed by urethral anastomosis. Recently, less invasive therapies including balloon
dilation or placement of the stent have been reported in the field of veterinary medicine
[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. They are minimally invasive, safe and effective
procedures that can be promptly performed to treat urethral obstructions [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In dogs and cats with malignant obstructions occurring
in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital and cardiovascular systems, the stenting
procedures have been introduced [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Of various types of
stenting, self-expanding metallic stents are a prompt, reliable and safe procedure that can be
used to establish urethral patency under the fluoroscopic guidance [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) is one of the materials that
are recommended to cover the metallic stent. Due to its resistance to the bacterial growth, it
has a lower risk of occlusion [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The aortic stent
graft extension (ASGE) is a medical device that is designed for the treatment of endovascular
aortic disease. It is made of a self-expanding nitinol wire and a biocompatible polyester
fabric composed of ePTFE. We placed the self-expandable ASGE to relieve obstruction due to
severe urethral stricture in a dog.</p>
    <p>A 2-year-old male mixed dog, weighing 7.8 kg, was referred to us for further evaluation and
treatment of oliguria and abdominal distension. The owner reported that the dog had a
4-week-history of the symptoms occurring after surgery for removal of calculus within
prostatic urethra. Physical examination revealed slight depression and moderately distended
bladder, but were otherwise unremarkable. On neurological examinations, there were no
abnormalities. Hematological results were within normal ranges. Serum biochemical
abnormalities include increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 35.0 mg/d<italic>l</italic>
(reference range, 7&#x2013;27 mg/d<italic>l</italic>). In addition, the urine sample was obtained
through cystocentesis; the specific gravity was 1.028, pH was 7.5 and protein was detected. On
ultrasound examination, there was hyperechoic signal intensity in the distal part of prostatic
urethra, for which the biopsy was performed with a disposable biopsy system (Primo Cut,
PAJUNK<sup>&#xAE;</sup> Medical Technology, Geisingen, Germany) under guidance of ultrasound at
the hyperechoic site. In the biopsy samples of urethra, there were multifocal regions with
mild proliferative changes and mild lymphohistocytic inflammations. A histological examination
confirmed the presence of chronic inflammation with proliferative epithelial changes. On
radiological examinations including a retrograde urethrogram, urethral stricture was confirmed
in the distal region to the bladder trigone. Because the site of stricture was too long,
urethral anastomosis could not be achieved. Since the client did not want another abdominal
surgery and the stricture might be present within the pelvic lumen, we placed a self-expanding
ASGE (S&amp;G Biotech Inc., Gyeonggido, South Korea) to relieve the urethral obstruction and
re-establish the luminal patency in the dog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.
1a</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>(a) Self-expandable aortic stent graft extension (ASGE) (b) Schematic diagram of the

a mesh-like structure made of nitinol metal, which function is to support the graft. The
stent-graft is packed in tubes with a small diameter, and it is expanded to its original
diameter when released from the tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1b</xref>).
Under a general anesthesia after the prepuce was exposed from the penis, a 5-F urinary
catheter was advanced into the urinary bladder in a retrograde fashion. The catheter was
easily passed with mild resistance inside the stricture part. This was followed by contrast
cytogram and urethrogram with an intravenous infusion of 50:50 mixtures of iohexol (iodine 500
mg/kg; Omnipaque<sup>&#xAE;</sup> inj, GE healthcare, New York, NY, U.S.A.) and sterile saline
(0.9% NaCl) solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2a</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Continuous fluoroscopic images; flat and narrow urethra can be observed on retrograde
radiogram from the severe stricture site to the bladder due to less contrast medium

and the expanded diameter of the prostatic and membranous urethras was about 12 mm
(d).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-75-1363-g002"/></fig>). At the level of prostatic urethra, a partial obstruction was achieved, and its length
was measured as approximately 40&#x2013;50 mm distal to the bladder trigone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2b</xref>). The diameter of urethra was measured at the site of
membranous urethra. Then, we selected self-expanding ASGE with an appropriate size; it was
greater than the normal urethra by 10&#x2013;15% and was longer by 1 cm than the urethral obstruction
from both the cranial and caudal ends. The stent was 6 cm long in length when fully expanded
to a maximum diameter of 12 mm, and it was positioned across the stenotic lesion using an 8-Fr
introducer system by withdrawing the outer sheath. This was followed by the removal of the
delivery system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2c and 2d</xref>). On post-procedural
radiography, it was determined that the stent was placed in the appropriate location within
the urethra and then extended into the bladder neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig.
3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Post-operative X-ray images taken following the placement of stent. (a) Lateral view,
(b): Ventrodorsal view.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-75-1363-g003"/></fig>). Following the procedure, the urinary catheter was appropriately maintained for 24 hr
to minimize the occurrence of postoperative urethral swelling immediately after the procedure.
At a 6-month follow-up, the owner reported that the dog had no voiding difficulty, but it had
a urinary incontinence. But, there were no other clinical complications.</p>
    <p>This is the first report that the self-expanding ASGE was placed in the urethra to relieve
the urethral obstruction due to severe granulomatous reaction due to surgical trauma in a dog.
In severe urethral stricture, surgery is the only treatment method for the stricture
accompanied by uncontrolled symptoms of urethral narrowing [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. But, they are disadvantageous in that they are a high-cost procedure that causes
surgical damages and re-stricture [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the field of
veterinary medicine, urethral balloon dilation is a relatively simple procedure for the
management of stricture, but there is also a tendency that the re-stricture would occur again
[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Urethral
metallic stents have a higher degree of external expansion than balloon stents. Therefore,
they are indicated for humans and animals with severe urethral obstruction due to neoplasia or
proliferative urethritis. Various forms of metallic stents are used to treat the obstructions
of the urinary tract. It has been reported that self-expanding nitinol urethral stents can be
stably used for the treatment of malignant urethral obstructions [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It has been reported that the PTFE-covered stents produce good clinical
outcomes, such as a decreased risk of stent obstruction and a prevention of the bacterial
growth [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, it has a poor adhesion to other
materials and is not prone to demolding, thus achieving a good patency [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. From this point of view, the dog was treated with the self-expanding,
ePTFE-covered stent to relieve the urethral stricture. The self-expanding ASGE, partially
covered with ePTFE, can be used for the dog, although it is originally designed for the
endovascular treatment of humans with abdominal aortic or aorto-iliac aneurysms. Urinary
incontinence is one of the common unfavorable events occurring after the placement of urethral
stent [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition, urinary tract infection can
occur, because urethra is open to the outside environment. In the current case, the dog
presented with a mild urinary incontinence. Urinary tract infection should be monitored for
the longer period. But, it achieved such good treatment outcomes as to show normal urinary
voiding with no other notable complications. In conclusion, the current case indicates that
the ePTFE-covered, self-expanding ASGE is an effective intervention for the treatment of
severe urethral stricture in the dog.</p>
