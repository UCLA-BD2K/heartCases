          <p>A 43-year-old male athlete reported with progressive exercise limitation since 8&#xA0;months. Six months earlier, pulmonary embolism had occurred, and was treated since with oral anticoagulation.

His peak oxygen uptake exceeded predicted values, however exercise ventilatory efficiency was abnormal, compared to a matching athlete.

Five and twelve months after surgery, his maximal exercise capacity and ventilatory efficiency profoundly improved beyond preoperative values, and his subjective exercise tolerance had returned to normal.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a progressive disease caused by wall-adherent, fibrotic thromboembolic material in the precapillary pulmonary circulation, despite oral anticoagulation. For patients with operable CTEPH, there is a clear recommendation for surgical removal of persistent thrombi by pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) as a curative approach in specialized centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, without the presence of PH, therapeutic management of chronic thromboembolic disease (CTED) is challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Currently, there is only rare evidence on therapeutic strategies of CTED and normal hemodynamics. In selected cases such as in athletes, reduced exercise tolerance and dyspnea may be related to the extent of persistent pulmonary perfusion defects and dead space ventilation, despite exceeding predicted values of maximal exercise capacity and normal pulmonary hemodynamics.</p>

    <sec id="Sec2">
      <title>Case Presentation</title>
      <p>We report the case of a 43-year-old male athlete (190&#xA0;cm, 82&#xA0;kg) who presented with progressive dyspnea and subjective exercise limitation in the prior 8&#xA0;months. He was able to cycle a distance of 50 kilometers per day and reported a continuously decreased ability to sustain this effort. Other daily activities were not affected. He had suffered from pulmonary embolism 6&#xA0;months prior to presentation, and had permanently been on therapeutic oral anticoagulation since this time point. He did not report any other known diseases.</p>
      <p>Physical examination did not reveal any relevant findings. Pulmonary function testing did not show any restrictive or obstructive limitation, with normal diffusion capacity. Echocardiography showed normal values, except a slightly enlarged right ventricle (basal diameter 42&#xA0;mm) and a slightly enlarged right atrium (area 19.8&#xA0;cm<sup>2</sup>). No tricuspid regurgitation could be detected.</p>
      <p>The patient&#x2019;s maximal exercise performance during cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was excellent, compared to his predicted values. He exercised on a cycle ergometer with a ramp protocol of 25 Watts per minute, and achieved 115&#xA0;% of his predicted peak oxygen uptake. Ventilatory efficiency was normal, relative to predicted values for an untrained, adult population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, compared to an athlete with a matching exercise capacity, his ventilatory efficiency during exercise was reduced, expressed by an elevated ratio of minute ventilation to CO<sub>2</sub> output (VE/VCO<sub>2</sub>), indicating a ventilation-/perfusion mismatch during exercise (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). A pulmonary ventilation/perfusion scan revealed large bilateral perfusion defects (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), which could be confirmed by CT scan. Surprisingly, the patient&#x2019;s pulmonary hemodynamics were completely normal. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure was 18&#xA0;mmHg, with a pulmonary arterial occlusion (wedge) pressure of 7&#xA0;mmHg, a cardiac index of 3.85&#xA0;L/Min/m<sup>2</sup> and a pulmonary vascular resistance of 1.35 wood units. Additionally, invasive exercise hemodynamics were obtained at a workload of 200 Watts. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure increased up to 43&#xA0;mmHg, however with a constant pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure and a substantial increase in cardiac output, so that pulmonary vascular resistance remained slightly unchanged at 1.56 wood units. Current guidelines do not recommend the use of the term &#x2018;exercise induced PH&#x2019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], as there is not sufficient evidence to support the definition. A current publication suggests to define a pathological exercise hemodynamic response as an increase of mean PAP above 30&#xA0;mmHg, combined with a cardiac output of less than 10&#xA0;L/Min, or with a PVR of less than 3 Wood units (240&#xA0;dyn x sec x cm<sup>-5</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, according to this definition, even exercise hemodynamics were normal in this case.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Functional assessment and imaging of chronic thromboembolic material in the pulmonary circulation. <bold>a</bold> VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> ratio during exercise.

      <p>For this situation, currently no evidence-based therapeutic recommendations are available. One single-center study retrospectively analyzed all patients with CTED and normal hemodynamics who had undergone surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Almost all patients improved in functional class, however changes in six-minute walking distance (6MWD), were heterogeneous. Although none of the patients died, major complications occurred in 40&#xA0;% of the cases.</p>
      <p>In the present case, therapeutic options were thoroughly discussed with the patient. He expressed a high degree of suffering. Considering the progressive nature of the disease, and in consensus with the patient&#x2019;s request, he was referred to an experienced center for PEA. Pulmonary angiography confirmed surgical accessibility of the thromboembolic material. The patient successfully underwent surgery 3&#xA0;months after initial presentation (surgical specimen, Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Lifelong oral anticoagulation was recommended. An inferior vena cava filter (IVC) was not inserted. There were no complications during the PEA procedure or during the post-operative phase. The patient was discharged from hospital 10&#xA0;days after the procedure.</p>
      <p>Two months after PEA, the patient was re-evaluated by echocardiography and CPET. At this time point, the patient did not feel any subjective improvement. Right ventricular dimensions were unchanged, however tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) was reduced to 16&#xA0;mm &#x2013; compared to 22&#xA0;mm before PEA. Peak oxygen uptake was reduced to 94&#xA0;% of predicted values, however ventilatory efficiency had improved, reflected by a lower VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> ratio (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Non-invasive serial measurements in a 43-year old, athletic patient with CTED and normal pulmonary hemodynamics. <bold>a</bold> CPET results. Constant improvement of ventilatory efficiency after surgery, reflected by decreasing VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> ratio and increasing peak P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> values.

Constant results of 6-minute walking distance</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12890_2016_180_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
      <p>However, five months after PEA, a significant treatment success could be documented. The patient reported to feel better, and peak oxygen uptake significantly improved to 4.0&#xA0;L/Min (136&#xA0;% of predicted values). Ventilatory efficiency was not normalized but further improved, documented by a lower VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> ratio compared to all previous tests (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).</p>
      <p>One year after PEA; a follow-up ventilation-/perfusion scan showed minor residual defects (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). In accordance with these findings, CPET showed a sustained improvement of peak oxygen uptake and of ventilatory efficiency, reflected by a decreased VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> ratio and substantially higher peak P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> values during exercise (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). TAPSE and NTpro-BNP levels had returned to normal (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).</p>
      <p>Follow-up measurements in patients with CTED and normal pulmonary hemodynamics are challenging. Currently, there is only one published case report in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Here, therapeutic effects were documented by CPET during serial follow-up visits. A substantial improvement in maximal exercise performance and in ventilatory efficiency could be demonstrated six months after surgery.</p>
      <p>At present, there are no data showing <italic>early</italic> effects after PEA in patients with normal hemodynamics. However, insights gained from CTEPH suggest that restoration of right and left ventricular function may be delayed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec3">
      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>This case remarkably demonstrates that significant chronic thromboembolic disease may be present without relevant pathologic changes in pulmonary hemodynamics at rest. Cardiopulmonary limitation may be masked by a high level of physical fitness. Thus, reaching normal values of maximal exercise capacity does not exclude pulmonary vascular disease in highly trained subjects. CPET may add clinical information on the degree of pulmonary ventilation-/perfusion mismatching during exercise.</p>
      <p>Although pathophysiological considerations suggest a beneficial treatment effect, more data are needed to evaluate the risk-/benefit ratio of PEA in patients with CTED and normal pulmonary hemodynamics. A thorough discussion with the patient as well as shared decision making regarding therapy are mandatory. Patients should only be referred to PEA expert centers. Successful surgical removal of chronic thromboembolic material may lead to beneficial, sustained treatment effects even in patients with normal pulmonary hemodynamics. However, the onset of these effects may be delayed. CPET may adequately reflect the response to therapy over time.</p>
