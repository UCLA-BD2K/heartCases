          <p>&#x2018;Flare phenomenon&#x2019; after initial luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist administration is a widely approved concept in the treatment of prostate cancer. In most guidelines, concomitant therapy with anti-androgens is recommended to prevent this flare phenomenon. However, there are few reports describing serum prostate-specific antigen transitions after hormonal therapy. Here, we present a case of a man who experienced the biochemical and clinical flare phenomenon despite prior anti-androgen use and who has detailed data.</p>

          <title>Case presentation</title>
          <p>A 70-year-old Asian man with metastatic prostate cancer (multiple bone) was referred to our hospital. He was treated with prior anti-androgens and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist. Regardless of prior use of anti-androgens, his low back pain caused by bone metastases was deteriorated and serum prostate-specific antigen level was raised from 974.8&#xA0;ng/mL to 2,555.5&#xA0;ng/mL within 3&#xA0;weeks. Then, his serum prostate specific antigen level started to decrease along with the pain. The nadir reached 1.0&#xA0;ng/mL and remained for 6&#xA0;months. Because the serum level of prostate-specific antigen then began to increase again, anti-androgen was discontinued for anti-androgen withdrawal syndrome. Then the serum level decreased again to less than 0.1&#xA0;ng/mL. Until now, his serum prostate-specific antigen level has been maintained at less than 0.1&#xA0;ng/mL for more than 30&#xA0;months without any clinical progressions.</p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>We present the case of a patient in whom a clinical flare caused by an leuteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist was not prevented by prior anti-androgen administration. In addition, the nadir level of prostate-specific antigen when he received leuteinizing hormone-releasing hormone monotherapy was ten times lower than when he received concomitant therapy, and period of anti-androgen withdrawal syndrome was longer than usual. In this case, anti-androgen was probably not effective from the initial administration. Awareness of the possibility of ineffectiveness of anti-androgens is important in the treatment of symptomatic metastatic prostate cancer. Leuteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist and surgical castration is a more reliable clinical approach for the prostate cancer patients with symptomatic metastatic disease.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonists are the &#x2018;standard of care&#x2019; in hormonal therapy for the patients with advanced prostate cancer because they avoid the physical and psychological discomfort associated with orchiectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, potent initial detrimental effects, called the &#x2018;flare phenomenon&#x2019;, in advanced disease is a main concern at the initial LH-RH administration, and it includes increased bone pain, acute bladder outlet obstruction, obstructive renal failure and spinal cord compression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The European Association of Urology guidelines recommend use of anti-androgens to prevent the clinical flare phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, in the clinical practice, the impact of the concomitant use of anti-androgen to avoid the clinical flare phenomenon, has practically been largely unknown. We report the case of a patient with metastatic prostate cancer who experienced the LH-RH agonist clinical flare despite preceding administration of non-steroidal anti-androgen.</p>

      <title>Case report</title>
      <p>A 70-year-old Asian man was referred to our hospital for treatment of prostate cancer. His serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 974.8&#xA0;ng/mL and trans-perineal prostatic biopsy revealed prostate cancer, with a Gleason score 5&#xA0;+&#xA0;4. A whole-body bone scintigraphy demonstrated multiple bone metastases [extent of disease (EOD): 2] including the sacral bone (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also indicated a metastasis at the same site, which was causing severe low back pain. The patient was hospitalized for pain control and started to undergo hormonal therapy. Prior administration of the non-steroidal anti-androgen, bicalutamide, was followed by injection of the LHRH-agonist, leuprorelin, after 1&#xA0;week. However, severe back pain continued to increase with increased PSA serum level (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). One week after bicalutamide administration, serum PSA level was elevated to 1,211.2&#xA0;ng/mL, and to 1,443.8&#xA0;ng/mL after 2&#xA0;weeks. Three weeks after leuprorelin injection and 4&#xA0;weeks after bicalutamide administration, while serum testosterone level had already been suppressed to castration levels (0.34&#xA0;ng/mL), the serum PSA reached a peak of 2,555.5&#xA0;ng/mL (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Thereafter, the serum PSA level decreased along with the patient&#x2019;s back pain. The serum testosterone was completely suppressed to a level of 0.1&#xA0;ng/mL and PSA nadir reached 1.0&#xA0;ng/mL and remained at approximately 1&#xA0;ng/mL for 6&#xA0;months (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). The PSA serum level then began to increase again without elevation of testosterone and any clinical symptoms, including back pain. For the purpose of anti-androgen withdrawal syndrome (AWS), bicalutamide was discontinued, and the serum PSA level decreased again to less than 0.1&#xA0;ng/mL. The patient is currently undergoing LH-RH agonist monotherapy and his serum PSA level has been maintained at less than 0.1&#xA0;ng/mL for more than 30&#xA0;months without any clinical symptoms (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#xA0;1</label><caption><p>Imaging and the clinical schema of a symptomatic metastatic prostate cancer patient. <bold>a</bold> Initial bone scan images showing multiple bone metastases, which included the sacral bone (<italic>arrow</italic>). <bold>b</bold> Initial clinical schematic presentation with alteration of the serum prostate-specific antigen level. <bold>c</bold> Clinical schematic presentation of the whole process with alteration of the serum prostate-specific antigen level.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13104_2015_1297_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>We present the case of a patient in whom a clinical flare caused by an LH-RH agonist was not prevented by prior anti-androgen administration. In addition, this case demonstrated a prolonged progression free survival (PFS) period (more than 30&#xA0;months and continuing) of anti-androgen withdrawal syndrome. Interestingly, the serum PSA nadir (0.1&#xA0;ng/mL) during LH-RH agonist monotherapy was 10-times less than the serum PSA level (1.0&#xA0;ng/mL) during concomitant anti-androgen and LH-RH agonist administration.</p>
      <p>Although LH-RH antagonists are available, the most common form of hormonal treatment is LH-RH agonist therapy. However, during the initial 1&#x2013;2&#xA0;weeks, a biochemical and occasionally a clinical flare can occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. To prevent the flare-up phenomenon, it is generally thought that prior anti-androgen administration can prevent the biochemical and clinical flare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, in the CS21 phase III Degarelix clinical trial, a smaller PSA surge was noted in the leuprolide patients, even those who were receiving concomitant anti-androgens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In this trial, the authors cautioned that addition of an anti-androgen to a LH-RH antagonist does not always prevent the flare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Oh et al. recently reported that the rates of clinical flare, including fractures, spinal cord compression, bladder outlet obstruction and narcotic prescriptions, were rare in the first 30&#xA0;days after beginning LH-RH agonist therapy regardless of whether or not anti-androgens are used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In this study, they described their question as: &#x201C;Does oral anti-androgen use before LH-RH agonists in patients with metastatic prostate cancer prevent clinical consequences of a testosterone flare?&#x201D; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, we present a valuable case here.</p>
      <p>Anti-androgen withdrawal syndrome is also important to discuss. Anti-androgen withdrawal syndrome was described for the first time by Scher and Kelly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It is known that approximately one-third of patients respond to anti-androgen withdrawal for a median duration of 4&#xA0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the SWOG 9426 trial, it was reported that the median PFS was 3&#xA0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, 19% patients had a PFS of 12&#xA0;months or greater, although all of these patients did not have metastatic disease (M0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In this study, factors associated with increased PFS and overall survival (OS) were longer period of anti-androgen use (more than 10&#xA0;months), lower PSA at baseline (less than 10&#xA0;ng/mL) and non-metastatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In our case, the patient&#x2019;s initial PSA is 974.8&#xA0;ng/ml, the period of anti-androgen use was 12&#xA0;months and the patient had multiple bone metastases. Only one of these factors applied somewhat to our patient. However, in our patient, the withdrawal state continued for more than 30&#xA0;months. In addition, the PSA serum nadir level during the concomitant anti-androgen administration is 10-times more than the level observed during LH-RH agonist monotherapy. Although no study has compared the PSA level nadir during the concomitant administration of anti-androgens and during LH-RH agonist monotherapy, our case shows a prolonged period of AWS and failure to prevent the flare-up. This suggests that, in this case, bicalutamide was ineffective from the first administration.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we reported the case of a patient whose clinical flare could not be prevented or reduced by prior use of the anti-androgen, bicalutamide. With this valuable experience, we re-confirmed that an LH-RH antagonist and surgical castration is a more reliable clinical approach for the prostate cancer patients with symptomatic metastatic disease.</p>
