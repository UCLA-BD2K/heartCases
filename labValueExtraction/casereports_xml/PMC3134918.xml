      <title>Medical Case in Details</title>
      <p>In August 20, 2008, (10:50 AM) a 28-year-old pregnant woman with a 16-week gestational age fetus was involved in a road car crash resulting in multiple traumas. She had two other children; one (a 7 year-old girl) who was diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy and the other (an 18 month&#x2013;old boy) who was in good health. Gravid=3, term=2, live=2 (G3T2L2). She was seated in the front seat of a midsize sedan car (Peugeot- Paykan) and her seatbelt was fastened(<xref rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>,<xref rid="F2">2</xref>). Peugeot- Paykan is a common family car in Iran assembled by the Paykan manufacturing with the same body panels as Paykan, however, manufacturing of Peugeot 504 engines has been suspend since 1991. Her brother was the driver. Nobody else was in the car. The cause of accident was speeding causing lost  of  control  and  subsequently  colliding with front long-vehicle. After the accident, she was transferred to a local Urgent Care Unit and received first aid of the ABCDE care included  : airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure. She was then transferred to a 515-bed General Hospital (Imam Reza Hospital) (arrived at 12.30 AM).  The primary examinations revealed patient was pale, no respiratory distress, Glasgow Coma Scale=15, Blood Pressure=90/50 mmHg, Pulse Rate=100/min, and Respirat-ory Rate=20/min. She had two open IV lines and lower extremities were fixed with removable splints.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the inferior of the abdomen and perineum areas were lacerated extensively, including vaginal (labia major and minor were involved, and the clitoris was traumatically removed), rectal areas (external sphincter was torn but the mucosal layer of rectum was intact) (<xref rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The patient's wounds activated bleeding and four extremities pulse could be palpated. Uterine size was about 18 weeks of pregnancy and a transverse supra pubic scar due to previous cesarean section could be seen. Blood sampling was done, and fluid and blood resuscitation were continued.</p>
      <p>Other physical and clinical examinations revealed that the Superior and inferior right ramous of pubis, proximal of right tibia and shaft of left fibula were fractured (<xref rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>,<xref rid="F4">4</xref>,<xref rid="F5">5</xref>).</p>
      <p>Furthermore, an abdominal-pelvic ultrasound (portable) didn&#x2019;t reveal any abdominal organ laceration or free fluid in abdomen and pelvic areas. Fetus was alive with normal fetal heart rate and amnionic fluid and placenta was in the posterior wall of the uterus without signs of subchorionic hematoma.</p>

      <p>2. Induction of anesthesia was started by opioid (fentanyl) and low dose of sodium thiopental. The maintenance of anesthesia was continued by opioid drug.</p>
      <p>3. Laparotomy with a midline incision was performed. Abdominal organs exploration were done that revealed an 18 weeks pregnant uterus and no organ damage, but a non-expanding hematoma (sized 10*10 cm) was in the right broad ligament.</p>
      <p>4. Diverting Colostomy was done to prevent fecal contamination of the perineum and rectal wound. Secondary infections and necrotizing fasciitis were the main surgical concerns. </p>
      <p>5. Pregnancy was terminated by hysterotomy.</p>
      <p>6. Right calcaneal traction and long leg splint were done.</p>
      <p>7. The wound of perineum underwent extensive irrigation debridements and it was left open (<xref rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). </p>
      <p>8. After the operation, she was admitted in ICU ward where she started recuperating process.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Traumatic injuries are prevalent in 6% to 7% of pregnant women and are among the most common causes of nonobstetric maternal risk factors for spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, premature delivery, and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup>Of the causes of trauma, motor vehicle accidents followed by domestic violence and falls are mostly responsible for abdominal injuries in pregnant women in compared to their nonpregnant counterparts. The immediate and long-term management of traumatic injury in pregnant women varies depending on the location and magnitude of the injury. However, regardless of the clinical situation, it is important that clinicians consult with an obstetrician as soon as possible, and perform preoperative assessment that includes airway evaluation as well as rapid and complete resuscitation of the mother. Radiologic tests while properly shielding the pregnant women&#x2019;s pelvis should remain a viable option as well. Also, when trauma does not result in sudden miscarriage, it is important to inform the patient of the trauma-related potential risks and provide appropriate counseling for the patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup></p>
      <p>If the traumatic injury involves a pregnant women who is in her 1st trimester, it is possible that she is not aware of her pregnancy, therefore, human chorionic gonadotropin test should be performed. This preliminary laboratory test is recommended for all injured women in childbearing age. In cases when traumatic injury occurs during the 2nd or 3rd trimester of pregnancy it is necessary to use ultrasound to verify the age, size, and viability of the fetal. Fetal heart rate should also be regularly monitored to specify how advanced pregnancy is and if the fetus would be viable if delivered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocol,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup>depicted in Figure 7 points to the rapid assessment; hemodynamic stabilization; and treatment of maternal injuries as the essential steps for the management of injury and survival of the fetus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup>(<xref rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>)</p>
