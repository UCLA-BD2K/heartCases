      <abstract>
        <p>We observed an unusually large subependymoma in a female patient with congenital aniridia. To analyze the genetic mechanisms of tumorigenesis, we first examined the paired box 6 (<italic>PAX6</italic>) gene using both tumor tissue and peripheral lymphocytes. Tumor suppressor activity has been proposed for <italic>PAX6</italic> in gliomas, in addition to its well-known role in the eye development. Using genomic quantitative PCR and loss of heterozygosity analysis, we identified hemizygous deletions in the 5&#x2032;-region of <italic>PAX6</italic>. In lymphocytes, the deletion within <italic>PAX6</italic> spanned from between exons 6 and 7 to the 5&#x2032;-upstream region of the gene, but did not reach the upstream gene, <italic>RNC1</italic>, which is reported to be associated with tumors. The subependymoma had an additional de novo deletion spanning from the intron 4 to intron 6 of <italic>PAX6</italic>, although we could not completely determine whether these two deletions are on the same chromosome or not. We also examined other potentially relevant tumor suppressor genes: <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>SOX2</italic>. However, we detected no exonic mutations or deletions in these genes. Collectively, we speculate that the defect in <italic>PAX6</italic> may have contributed to the extremely large size of the subependymoma, due to a loss of tumor suppressor activity in glial cell lineage.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Subependymoma is a rare, indolent benign tumor of the central nervous system that commonly occurs in middle-aged or elderly men, with an incidence of approximately 0.5% of all intracranial neoplasms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">(15)</xref>. The majority of tumors arise in the fourth (60%) and lateral ventricles (30%), and more rarely in the third ventricle, the septum pellucidum and the spinal cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">(18)</xref>. Many subependymomas remain asymptomatic throughout life and are found only incidentally by autopsy or imaging. The pathogenesis of the tumor remains largely unclear.</p>
      <p>We observed an extremely rare case of a giant subependymoma in a young female with familial congenital aniridia that spans three generations. Familial congenital aniridia is a hereditary disease transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion and is caused by genetic defects within the paired box 6 (<italic>PAX6</italic>) gene in about 90% of cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">(8)</xref>. The <italic>PAX6</italic> gene is located at chromosome 11p13, spans 22 kb, consists of 14 exons (including an alternatively spliced exon 5a that encodes 14 amino acids) and encodes a protein of 422 amino acids. PAX6 is a transcription factor that is involved in multiple developmental pathways and is expressed early in the development of the eye, numerous regions of the brain and the pancreas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">(14)</xref>. Recently, it has been reported that <italic>PAX6</italic> could be a glioma suppressor gene, based on two main facts: the expression of <italic>PAX6</italic> correlates with astrocytoma grade and survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">(24)</xref> and PAX6 suppresses the growth of glioblastoma cells <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">(25)</xref>. It has also been reported that <italic>PAX6</italic> inhibits proliferation of astrocyte progenitors and promotes their maturation in rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">(16)</xref>. Although the precursor cells of subependymomas have not been conclusively identified, some candidates have been proposed: subependymal glia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">(1)</xref>, astrocytes of the subependymal plate, ependymal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">(12)</xref> and a mixture of astrocytes and ependymal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">(4)</xref>.</p>
      <p>Since there have been no reports of subependymoma occurring in any hereditary diseases, we set out to perform this study in the hope that analyses of the current case with the complication of eye abnormalities may help determine the mechanisms responsible for the huge growth of the subependymoma.</p>

        <title>Patient</title>
        <p>The patient describes a 27-year-old female after admission to our hospital (Kanazawa University Hospital). She was born at full term after an uneventful pregnancy. Five months before admission, she complained of chronic headaches and nocturnal urinary incontinence. In March 2005, she was admitted to our hospital because of memory disturbances, unsteady gait and visual loss. Neuro-ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral aniridia, blepharoptosis, mild cataract, papilledema, horizontal gaze nystagmus and marked and nonadjustable visual loss. Similar ocular disturbances were observed in her mother and her elder brother, but their irises were only partially defective and irregularly shaped. The maternal grandfather and three of five maternal siblings were said to have ocular disturbances but the details are unknown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Their abnormalities of the eye had probably been overlooked because they live in a rural part of Japan and had no previous need for a specialist medical examination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on admission revealed a large tumor (9 &#xD7; 7 &#xD7; 6 cm) located in the third to bilateral lateral ventricles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>). Scattered microcalcifications were detected on computed tomography (CT). She underwent surgery via the anterior transcallosal approach. The tumor stemmed from the septum pellucidum and was well demarcated from the ventricular wall except for the right anterior horn. The tumor was grayish, rubbery, unsuckable in consistency and bled minimally. Intraoperative pathologic diagnosis indicated a subependymoma and gross total resection was performed with an Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (Sonopet, Miwatec Co., Ltd, Aichi, Japan).</p>

        <p>Genomic DNA was isolated from paraffin-embedded tumor tissue using RecoverAll&#x2122; Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) that contains protease to break down cross-linked proteins, and peripheral lymphocytes from the patient and from five control subjects (one male and five females) by standard methods. All the exons and exon/intron boundaries of <italic>PAX6</italic>, <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>TP53</italic> (gene for p53) and <italic>SOX2</italic> were screened for polymorphisms by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products.

Direct sequencing of PCR products was performed using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) and the ABI PRISM 3730xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Polymorphisms were detected with the SEQUENCHER program (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI).

        <title>Genomic quantitative PCR</title>
        <p>All of the insertions/deletions within each gene and in intergenic regions were analyzed by real-time genomic quantitative PCR using the TaqMan method (Applied Biosystems). The <italic>MLC1</italic> gene at chromosome 22q13.33 was used as a normal copy number control gene. For quality control, <italic>PFKFB1</italic> on chromosome Xp11.21 was used to see whether our genomic quantitative PCR could accurately detect differential dosage of the X chromosome between male and female control samples. No copy number polymorphisms have been documented within these genes in the Japanese population. For the genomic quantitative PCR, DNA solutions were first quantified by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer and further quantified by a TaqMan RNase P Detection Reagent kit (Applied Biosystems).

        <title>Sequencing and genomic quantitative PCR analyses of <italic>PAX6</italic></title>
        <p>To examine mutations of the <italic>PAX6</italic> gene, we performed direct sequencing of all the exons and exon/intron boundaries of the gene using DNA from the patient's tumor tissue and lymphocytes. We detected no mutations of <italic>PAX6</italic> in either sample.</p>
        <p>Next, to examine allelic loss of <italic>PAX6</italic> in the patient's tissue, we performed genomic quantitative PCR with probes designed to exons 13, 7, 6, 5, 2 and 1a of <italic>PAX6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>), and around rs11031497 [64 296 base pairs (bp) upstream from the A of the ATG codon of <italic>PAX6</italic> and 235 016 bp downstream of the 3&#x2032;-end of the last exon of <italic>RCN1</italic>] and rs12420599 (251 262 bp upstream from the ATG codon of <italic>PAX6</italic> and 48 050 bp downstream of the 3&#x2032;-end of <italic>RCN1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>). In the lymphocyte genome, hemizygous deletions were evident with probes to exons 2 and 1a, indicating that the deleted region spans from between exons 5 and 2 to downstream of rs11031497 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In the tumor tissue, the probe to exon 7 showed no evidence of deletion and the probe to exon 6 displayed a signature of deletion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, it seemed that in the tumor cells, the <italic>PAX6</italic> deletion extends more to 3&#x2032;-direction than that of the lymphocyte genome, or the tumor genome has an additional de novo deletion. To address this issue, we performed additional genomic quantitative PCR analyses with probes designed to intron 2, exon 3, intron 3, exon 4 and intron 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>). These results show that the tumor genome has two distinct <italic>PAX6</italic> deletions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>): the one is the same to that of normal somatic cells (albeit we did not examine whether the 5&#x2032;-break points of tumor and somatic cell genomes are on the same position), and the other de novo one spans from the intron 4 to intron 6 of <italic>PAX6</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>). We also attempted to determine the deletion boundaries of the de novo deletion by PCR, but we failed to amplify any genomic fragments under multiple conditions tested, presumably because it is difficult to completely eliminate peptide fragments bound to DNA, which is generated by formaldehyde fixation of tumor tissue; we cannot amplify such DNA of relatively long size by PCR that peptide fragments are attached to.</p>

        <title>RT&#x2013;PCR analysis of <italic>PAX6</italic> transcript from tumor tissue</title>
        <p>Next, we set out to determine whether the two different deletions of <italic>PAX6</italic> in tumor genome are on the same chromosome or on different chromosomes. The 5&#x2032;-side (germline) deletion involves the promoter region and the first two exons, making the mRNA transcription impossible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, if the two different deletions were located on the same chromosome, we could not amplify any portions of <italic>PAX6</italic> transcript from the tumor tissue including the region that corresponds to the 3&#x2032;-side de novo deleted genomic interval. Our RT&#x2013;PCR analysis detected the cDNA stretch that spans from exon 5 to exon 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4</xref>). These results suggest that the two deletions seen in the tumor genome are likely to be located on the same chromosome in tandem. However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the detected PCR products stemmed from the contaminated normal cells in the tumor tissue.</p>

        <title>LOH analysis around <italic>PAX6</italic> locus</title>
        <p>We examined the genotypes of 73 SNPs mapped in the interval spanning from the last exon 13 of <italic>PAX6</italic> to the 5&#x2032;-region of the neighboring <italic>RCN1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>). We included all known SNPs that mapped in the region from intron 2 to the exon 13, to confirm the genomic quantitative PCR results for the position of the breakpoint in tumor cells. In both the tumor and lymphocyte samples, the homozygosity of SNPs ensued from the most 3&#x2032;-end SNP examined, e.g. rs3026398&#x2013;rs12420599. The 5&#x2032;-neighboring SNP to rs12420599, rs224634 showed heterozygosity in both samples. In some of the five control samples (lymphocytes), heterozygous genotypes of SNPs were detected in the described genomic stretch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>). These results suggest that (i) the 3&#x2032;-end of the deleted region from the patient lymphocytes is within intron 2 of <italic>PAX6</italic> as deduced from the combined genomic quantitative PCR and LOH data, and (ii) the 5&#x2032;-ends of the deleted regions are the same or very close to each other in the tumor and normal somatic cells of the patient. In addition, the results indicate that the genomic deletions occurring in the patient do not involve the <italic>RCN1</italic> gene or are unlikely to involve the promoter region of the <italic>RCN1</italic> (the distance between rs224634 and the 5&#x2032;-end of <italic>RCN1</italic> is 33 256 bp). From LOH analysis, we could not obtain further informative data beyond quantitative genomic PCR analysis, regarding the 3&#x2032;-ends of the two deletions, because there were no heterozygous SNPs in the interval 3&#x2032;-downstream of intron 2 [and there are no known SNPs in the genomic stretch from exon 5 to exon 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>)].</p>

        <title>Screening of the tumor related genes: <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>SOX2</italic></title>
        <p>To further evaluate the potential genomic abnormalities associated with this subependymoma, we examined three tumor-related genes: <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>SOX2</italic>. We performed direct sequencing of all exons and exon/intron boundaries of the three genes from patient tumor tissue and lymphocytes and lymphocytes from six control subjects. In this analysis, we detected two novel SNPs (one in intron 1 and the second in intron 8) within <italic>PTEN</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S3</xref>). A novel C allele at IVS4-137 was found in the patient's tumor. The other novel 8T allele at IVS4-30-37 (insT: 9T is already registered) was found in the patient's tumor. We deposited these novel SNPs into the NCBI database, and obtained the I.D. ss161110057 and ss161110058, respectively. However, there were no exonic mutations in any of the samples. In addition, the genotypes of the examined SNPs located between the first and last intron of <italic>PTEN</italic> were all heterozygous in the tumor sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S3</xref>), excluding the possibility of allelic deletion within the gene.</p>
        <p>With regards to the <italic>TP53</italic> gene, sequencing detected no mutations in either the patient's tumor or lymphocyte samples, or in the two control samples. The genotypes of all the SNPs examined in the patient were homozygous in the tumor tissue and lymphocytes, giving no information about the genomic deletions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Table S4</xref>). We confirmed the absence of any deletions using real-time PCR to quantify genomic DNA templates from exon 1, intron 6 and exon 11 (the last exon) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S5</xref>).</p>
        <p>The <italic>SOX2</italic> gene consists of one exon. We performed genomic quantitative PCR using probes designed to the 5&#x2032;and the 3&#x2032;-regions of exon1. The results showed no evidence of genomic deletions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Table S6</xref>).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Here, we report the first case of subependymoma developed in a patient with a hereditary disease (aniridia). The size of subependymoma was unusually huge. We also examined the underlying mechanisms and detected a deletion in the 5&#x2032;-region of <italic>PAX6</italic> in lymphocytes and tumor cells and an additional de novo deletion in the tumor cells from the patient. Postoperatively, the patient was slightly hemiparetic on the left, but recovered completely after 1 month. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt procedure was performed for delayed hydrocephalus. Three years after the operation, an MRI revealed no tumor recurrence and she recovered fully from her neurological symptoms. During this time, she had gotten married and delivered a full-term baby boy who also displayed an irregular-shaped iris and spontaneous nystagmus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>
      <p>While the familial aniridia can be explained by the <italic>PAX6</italic> deletion, it is likely other/additional genetic mechanism(s) played a role in the onset and extraordinarily large growth of the subependymoma. Therefore, we examined three other tumor suppressor genes, <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>SOX2</italic>, which are relevant to either glioma or PAX6 function. <italic>PTEN</italic> is a major tumor suppressor gene that is inactivated in 50% of high-grade gliomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">(5)</xref>. <italic>PAX6</italic> and <italic>PTEN</italic> expression levels are deemed to be two independent and powerful prognostic markers for the outcome of patients with astrocytic malignant gliomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">(24)</xref>. The mutational inactivation of <italic>TP53</italic> has been reported in progressive glioblastomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">(5)</xref>. <italic>SOX2</italic> encodes a transcription factor, and this protein is known to act by forming a heterodimer with PAX6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">(9)</xref>. SOX2 is a marker for gliomas in early and progressed stages, and it plays a fundamental role in the maintenance of the self-renewal capacity of neural stem cells after they have acquired cancer properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">(6)</xref>. However, the patient had no mutations or deletions in these genes ruling out a possible contribution to the development of the giant subependymoma. In addition, karyotype analysis showed that there are no gross chromosomal abnormalities in the patient. Regarding microdeletions reported in some subependymoma cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">(10)</xref>, we detected no deletion in chromosome 14q, but found a partial loss in chromosome 6q (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2</xref>). However, since the latter genomic portion is one of the known common copy number polymorphisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">(13)</xref>, it is likely that there are little effects of the deletion on the tumor onset and growth.</p>
      <p>The gene immediately upstream of <italic>PAX6</italic> is the gene (<italic>RCN1</italic>) for reticulocalbin 1 EF-hand calcium-binding domain (<italic>PAX6</italic> and <italic>RCN1</italic> are located in a head-to-head fashion in the genome). There are some reports that <italic>RCN1</italic> is associated with tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">(3)</xref>. However, the detected deletion in the tumor cells did not affect this gene, again excluding a potential role for <italic>RCN1</italic> in this subependymoma.</p>
      <p>There are several reports demonstrating that deletions of tumor-related regions of <italic>PAX6</italic> or dominant negative activity generated by <italic>PAX6</italic> mutations are associated with tumors of glial cell origin. A 57 bp <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element named E1E (exon 1 enhancer) in the first exon of <italic>PAX6</italic> plays an important role in the expression of this gene in glioblastoma cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">(23)</xref>, and a powerful silencer (SX250) located between 1518 and 1268 bp from the A of the ATG codon is able to repress the promoter activity of <italic>PAX6</italic> in cervical carcinoma and glioblastoma cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">(22)</xref>. Pure subependymomas have a dense gliofibrillary background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">(18)</xref>. In the patient's subependymoma cells, the above regulatory elements are heterozygously deleted. Therefore, it would be one of possible scenarios that the subependymoma occurred independently in this patient but its unusually large size (maximum diameter of 90 mm) is due to haploinsufficiency of tumor suppressor elements. It is known that PAX6 proteins with C-terminal deletions have dominant negative activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">(19)</xref>. In this study, we detected an additional de novo <italic>PAX6</italic> 3&#x2019;-side deletion in patient's tumor cells. Our PCR analysis of transcripts suggested that the tumor cell has the two distinct deletions on the same chromosome, although we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the results are derived from the coexisting normal cells in the tumor tissue. If both deletions were located on the same chromosome, the effects of PAX6 dominant negative activity could be neglected because the gene is transcribed from only the normal allele.</p>
      <p>The incidence of all types of intracranial neoplasms is reported to be 0.008%&#x2013;0.01% in general population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">(11)</xref>. And the incidence of subependymoma is reported to be 0.5% of all intracranial neoplasms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">(15)</xref>. Therefore the incidence of subependymoma is deemed to be 0.004%&#x2013;&#x2013;0.005% in both general population and aniridia patients. We think that this rareness is related to no reports, to our knowledge, of giant subependymomas in aniridia patients. In addition, aniridia itself is very rare: a frequency of about 1 in 50 000&#x2013;100 000 live births <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">(2)</xref>.</p>
      <p>It is reported that a compound heterozygous mutation of <italic>PAX6</italic> causes severe defects of the brain including the eyes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">(7)</xref>. However, we did not detect any amino acid mutations of PAX6 in the patient's tumor or lymphocytes. For epigenetic changes, it is known that there are many CpG-rich regions in <italic>PAX6</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">(17)</xref>. These regions may be frequently methylated in tumors, which could affect the transcription of <italic>PAX6</italic> and tumorigenesis, though we did not address this issue in the present study because we do not have neighboring normal tissue, making the comparison of DNA methylation status between tumor and normal tissues impossible.</p>
      <p>It is noteworthy that although <italic>PAX6</italic> defects elicit congenital aniridia in a dominant hereditary fashion, phenotypes of the eye are sometimes overlooked, especially when the abnormalities are mild and/or de novo gene defects occur. Our experience suggests that it would be prudent to pay closer attention to abnormalities of the eye when presented with large, indolent, benign gliomas.</p>
      <p>In summary, we identified the first case of subependymoma concomitant with a hereditary disease, familial aniridia. In addition, the present subependymoma is uncommon in terms of its extremely large size, anatomical site of development and the patient's age and sex. There is a unique registration site, the Danish Cancer Registry, that has collected data on patients having both aniridia and cancer since 1943 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">(20)</xref>. Although eight patients are diagnosed as having kidney, lung and digestive tract cancers from the 136 aniridia carriers, there are no recorded brain tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">(8)</xref>. Therefore, the currently detected deletions of <italic>PAX6</italic> are unlikely to be responsible for the subependymoma onset. Given the reports that loss of <italic>PAX6</italic> function leads to aberrant proliferation and immature differentiation of astrocytes in rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">(16)</xref>, it is reasonable to assume that the <italic>PAX6</italic> deletions contributed to the unusual proliferation of the tumor after its independent initiation. Further reports of the mechanisms of development of subependymoma are warranted.</p>
