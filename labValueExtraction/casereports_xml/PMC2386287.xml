      <abstract>
        <p>The human 1p36 region is deleted in many different types of tumors, and so it probably harbors one or more tumor suppressor genes. In a Belgian neuroblastoma patient, a constitutional balanced translocation t(1;17)(p36.2;q11.2) may have led to the development of the tumor by disrupting or activating a gene. Here, we report the cloning of both translocation breakpoints and the identification of a novel gene that is disrupted by this translocation. This gene, named <italic>NBPF1</italic> for Neuroblastoma BreakPoint Family member 1, belongs to a recently described gene family encoding highly similar proteins, the functions of which are unknown. The translocation truncates <italic>NBPF1</italic> and gives rise to two chimeric transcripts of <italic>NBPF1</italic> sequences fused to sequences derived from chromosome 17. On chromosome 17, the translocation disrupts one of the isoforms of <italic>ACCN1</italic>, a potential glioma tumor suppressor gene. Expression of the <italic>NBPF</italic> family in neuroblastoma cell lines is highly variable, but it is decreased in cell lines that have a deletion of chromosome 1p. More importantly, expression profiling of the <italic>NBPF1</italic> gene showed that its expression is significantly lower in cell lines with heterozygous <italic>NBPF1</italic> loss than in cell lines with a normal 1p chromosome. Meta-analysis of the expression of <italic>NBPF</italic> and <italic>ACCN1</italic> in neuroblastoma tumors indicates a role for the <italic>NBPF</italic> genes and for <italic>ACCN1</italic> in tumor aggressiveness. Additionally, DLD1 cells with inducible NBPF1 expression showed a marked decrease of clonal growth in a soft agar assay. The disruption of both <italic>NBPF1</italic> and <italic>ACCN1</italic> genes in this neuroblastoma patient indicates that these genes might suppress development of neuroblastoma and possibly other tumor types.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Neuroblastoma, a tumor derived from pluripotent neuroblasts, is the most frequent extracranial solid malignancy of childhood. It is remarkably heterogeneous both clinically and biologically, as there is a large variation in tumor progression depending on the age of the patient at the time of diagnosis and the tumor stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Brodeur1">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Different genetic abnormalities are frequently observed in primary neuroblastoma tumors and their derivative cell lines. The most frequent aberration is the unbalanced gain of 17q, often due to translocation of the 17q segment to other chromosomes, combined with retention of two copies of the normal chromosome 17. One of the most common translocation partners for the 17q fragment is chromosome 1p, indicating that this translocation confers a selective advantage on cells by disrupting or activating certain genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Savelyeva1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-VanRoy1">[3]</xref>. As the translocation breakpoints are scattered on chromosomes 1 and 17, there is little evidence for a gene-specific inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-VanRoy2">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Amplification of the proto-oncogene <italic>MYCN</italic>, which occurs in about one quarter of all neuroblastomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Brodeur1">[1]</xref>, is correlated with poor prognosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Seeger1">[5]</xref>. Several studies have shown a strong correlation between <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification and deletion of the short arm of chromosome 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Attiyeh1">[6]</xref>, another frequent abnormality in neuroblastomas. Other deletions frequently affect chromosomes 3p and 11q <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Brodeur1">[1]</xref> and hint at the presence of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in these chromosomal regions.</p>
      <p>Previously, we described a <italic>de novo</italic>, apparently balanced, constitutional translocation t(1;17)(p36.2;q11.2) in a neuroblastoma patient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Laureys1">[7]</xref>. According to Knudson's two-hit hypothesis, constitutional deletions and translocations in patients with specific tumors are often the first indicators of the presence of TSGs. Several lines of evidence lead to the hypothesis that the 1p36 locus harbors one or more TSGs for neuroblastoma. Introduction of the short arm of chromosome 1 in the neuroblastoma cell line NGP results in a differentiated phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Bader1">[8]</xref>, providing experimental evidence for this hypothesis. Furthermore, constitutional deletions or translocations affecting the 1p36 region have been described in other neuroblastoma patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Biegel1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-White1">[10]</xref>. Several other tumor types, such as breast cancer, malignant melanoma and colorectal cancer, are also characterized by frequent deletions or translocations of 1p36 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Schwab1">[11]</xref>. In several types of tumors, including neuroblastoma, the shortest regions of overlap for 1p deletions partly coincide, indicating that the same TSGs may be implicated in different types of tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Bieche1">[12]</xref>. A number of strong candidate TSGs were recently reported for 1p, including the <italic>CHD5</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Bagchi1">[13]</xref> and the microRNA-34a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Welch1">[14]</xref>. However, deletions in chromosome 1p36 are often very large in neuroblastoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-White2">[15]</xref>, and it is likely that defects in more than one gene may contribute to the malignant phenotype. Expression profiling showed that expression levels of some genes located in the 1p35-36 region were decreased in neuroblastoma tumors and cell lines with 1p deletion as compared to 1p-normal samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Fransson1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-JanoueixLerosey1">[17]</xref>. Consequently, it was proposed that the underlying reason for the frequent deletion of this region in neuroblastoma is the decreased expression of several TSGs located in the 1p36 region and not the inactivation of one single classical TSG.</p>

        <title>Identification of rearranged genomic fragments encompassing the constitutional t(1;17) translocation breakpoint</title>
        <p>Karyotypic analysis of the lymphocytes of a neuroblastoma patient revealed a <italic>de novo</italic>, constitutional, apparently balanced translocation between chromosomes 1p36.2 and 17q11.2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Laureys1">[7]</xref>. Karyotyping of the primary tumor was unsuccessful, mostly due to necrosis. Due to the highly repetitive structure of the chromosome 1p36 region, breakpoint cloning proved to be extremely difficult. For this reason, we constructed a PAC/BAC contig of 1.5 Mbp covering the 17q breakpoint, and by screening a chromosome-17 specific cosmid library we identified three cosmids overlapping the breakpoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-VanRoy3">[18]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To facilitate the identification and cloning of the t(1;17) translocation breakpoints, genomic DNA from the somatic cell hybrids 32-7A and 32-2F53VIII, the Chinese hamster ovary cell line A/3, and normal human placenta were used for Southern blot analysis. The somatic cell hybrids 32-7A and 32-2F53VIII contain, respectively, the der(1) and the der(17) chromosomes of this neuroblastoma patient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Laureys1">[7]</xref>. Based on the sequence of the cosmid contig spanning the chromosome 17 translocation breakpoint (GenBank Acc N&#xB0; AF148647), nine DNA probes free of repetitive sequences were selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002207-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). These probes were used for Southern blot analysis to search for abnormal, patient-specific hybridization bands. Probes 6 and 9 revealed additional bands in the DNA of cell lines 32-2F53VIII and 32-7A, respectively, but not in any of the other DNAs analyzed, indicating that these fragments span the chromosome 17 translocation breakpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002207-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Both hybrid cell lines also contain a copy of the normal chromosome 17, resulting in the appearance of a &#x2018;normal&#x2019; band in these cell lines.</p>

        <title>Analysis of sequences flanking the constitutional t(1;17) translocation breakpoints</title>
        <p>Previous FISH experiments indicated that the constitutional translocation was balanced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Laureys1">[7]</xref>. To verify this at the molecular level, we compared the chromosome 17 sequences obtained by GenomeWalker PCR to the sequence of the cosmid contig spanning the der(17) translocation breakpoint. We found that the translocation was indeed balanced on this level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002207-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). However, comparison of the chromosome 1 sequences to the human genome reference sequence (NCBI Build 36.1) revealed greater complexity.</p>
        <p>In both derivative chromosomes, a few nucleotides of unknown origin had been inserted between the chromosome 1 and chromosome 17 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002207-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002207-g002">2</xref>), a feature frequently observed in reciprocal constitutional translocations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-WillettBrozick1">[22]</xref>.

            <p>Schematic representation of the normal chromosome 1p36 and 17q12 regions is shown in the central box. On chromosome 1 (black bars) both translocation breakpoints are located in intronic regions of the <italic>NBPF1</italic> gene, which is only partially shown (indicated by the dotted line). The breakpoint of the der(1) chromosome is located in a LINE repeat, shown as a black box labeled L1-PA4 on the genomic region. The black boxes below the genomic sequence represent the exons of the <italic>NBPF1</italic> gene, with the exon type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Vandepoele2">[27]</xref> indicated under each box. The translocation resulted in deletion of 5,215 bp. The translocation breakpoint on chromosome 17 (white bars) is located in an <italic>ACCN1</italic> intron and disrupts isoform 2 but leaves isoform 1 intact. Transcription starts are indicated by angled arrows. The breakpoint is located in a LINE repeat, shown as a white box labelled L2 on the genomic region. White boxes below the genomic sequence represent the exons of the <italic>ACCN1</italic> gene. On the der(1) chromosome (top), the <italic>NBPF1</italic> gene is disrupted, giving rise to two chimeric cDNAs (shown as NBPF1-CHI, with the grey box representing the chromosome 17-derived fusion partners). The promoter region and first exon of <italic>ACCN1</italic> isoform 2 are translocated to the der(1) chromosome, but no chimeric transcripts have been isolated yet (shown with the question mark and dotted line). On the der(17) chromosome (bottom), <italic>ACCN1</italic> isoform 1 is unaffected by the translocation, but as the promoter and first exon of isoform 2 are translocated, isoform 2 is probably no longer expressed (shown by the dotted line and question mark). The last three <italic>NBPF1</italic> exons (shown as exons of types 11, 12, and 14) are translocated to the der(17) chromosome. Arrows on the genomic sequence represent promoter sequences, and arrowheads in the transcripts show the orientation of the genes; tel, telomeric end; cen, centromeric end.

        <p>We previously reported that <italic>ACCN1</italic> is the closest gene to the 17q breakpoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-VanRoy3">[18]</xref>, but after completion of the human genome sequence it became clear that the translocation disrupts one of the isoforms of <italic>ACCN1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002207-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This gene encodes an amiloride-sensitive cation channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Waldmann1">[24]</xref> with two transmembrane domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Saugstad1">[25]</xref>. It was shown that the <italic>ACCN1</italic> gene is expressed as two isoforms differing in their 5&#x2032;UTR and N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002207-g003">Figure 3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Lingueglia1">[26]</xref>. All exons encoding isoform 1 (GenBank Acc N&#xB0; NM_183377.1) are located proximal to the translocation breakpoint, whereas the first exon of isoform 2 (GenBank Acc N&#xB0; NM_001094.4) is located distal to the breakpoint. The remaining exons of isoform 2 are shared with isoform 1 and are proximal to the breakpoint. The translocation thus disrupts isoform 2 of the <italic>ACCN1</italic> gene without disturbing isoform 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002207-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Both isoforms are also found in mouse and rat, strengthening their functional relevance. On the translocated 1p-fragment of the der(17) chromosome, we identified three exons encoding the carboxyterminal domain of the recently described NBPF1 protein. These are shown as exons of types 11, 12 and 14 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002207-g001">figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002207-g003">3</xref> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Vandepoele2">[27]</xref> for numbering of <italic>NBPF1</italic> exon types). <italic>NBPF1</italic> is a member of a novel gene family with an intricate genomic structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Vandepoele2">[27]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Popesco1">[29]</xref>. Analysis of the der(1) sequences proximal to the breakpoint revealed the presence of two exons (shown as exons of types 6 and 7 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002207-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002207-g003">Figure 3</xref>) that encode an internal domain of the NBPF1 protein. From this we conclude that the two breakpoints are located within distinct introns of the <italic>NBPF1</italic> gene.</p>
        <p>Although the translocation appeared cytogenetically balanced, molecular cloning of the breakpoint sequences revealed a deletion of part of the <italic>NBPF1</italic> gene. Recent reports describing structural variation in the human genome have shown recurrent structural abnormalities in the <italic>NBPF1</italic> locus in normal individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Tuzun1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Redon1">[31]</xref>; we also observed these abnormalities in our analysis of <italic>NBPF1</italic> cDNA clones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Vandepoele2">[27]</xref>. Due to this diversity, it is not possible to precisely determine the length of the deleted genomic fragment on chromosome 1 in this patient. However, compared to the human genome reference sequence (NCBI Build 36.1), a fragment comprising at least four exons of the <italic>NBPF1</italic> gene is missing (5,215 bp nucleotides: 16,764,933 to 16,770,147 of chromosome 1).</p>

In one chimeric transcript, the type-7 exon sequence was spliced to chromosome-17 sequences located 338 bp distal to the breakpoint, yielding a transcript extended by 295 nucleotides derived from chromosome 17, and an open reading frame extended by 34 additional codons (GenBank Acc No. AF420438). In a second chimeric transcript, the type-7 exon sequence was spliced to chromosome-17 sequences located 8,602 bp from the breakpoint, yielding a transcript extended by 325 nucleotides derived from chromosome 17, and an <italic>NBPF1</italic> open reading frame extended by 11 additional codons (GenBank Acc N&#xB0; AF420439). The sequences derived from chromosome-17 were not found in other sequences known to be expressed, and were therefore classified as non-expressed sequences.

        <p>A typical feature of a classical TSG is that its function is inactivated in different tumors. This inactivation can be caused by lack of expression due to deletion or promoter silencing. In a first quantitative RT-PCR assay we assessed four amplicons distributed across the <italic>NBPF</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002207-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, top panel).

Additionally, due to the repetitive nature of the <italic>NBPF</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Vandepoele2">[27]</xref>, some primers can also bind to multiple positions on one transcript.

In addition, we used two amplicons that can occur in multiple copies in the same transcript: one amplicon on the 5&#x2032; repeat exons (amplicon A) and one amplicon on the 3&#x2032; repeat exons (amplicon C). In the reference <italic>NBPF1</italic> transcript (GenBank Acc N&#xB0; NM_017940), amplicon A is present in two copies and amplicon C as one copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002207-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). However, in transcripts from other <italic>NBPF</italic> paralogs, amplicon A can be present as only one copy and amplicon C can be present as multiple copies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Vandepoele2">[27]</xref>. These amplicons were analyzed in a panel of 31 neuroblastoma cell lines, some with a heterozygous deletion of <italic>NBPF1</italic> (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;25) and some with two copies of the <italic>NBPF1</italic> gene (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;5). As expected, the expression levels of amplicons B and D were comparable (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.95), but in some cases these levels differed considerably from those of amplicons A and C (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.86 for both A&#x2013;D and C&#x2013;D). All together, this analysis showed that the expression of all <italic>NBPF</italic> transcripts combined varied widely between different neuroblastoma cell lines: expression of amplicon C in cell lines SK-N-FI, SK-N-SH and NLF was up to fifteen-fold higher than in STA-NB-3. However, the expression level of amplicon B in these three cell lines was only six- to eleven-fold higher than in STA-NB-3. This difference was probably due to increased expression of transcripts containing multiple copies of amplicon C (e.g. <italic>NBPF10</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Vandepoele2">[27]</xref> in the SK-N-FI, SK-N-SH and NLF cell lines as compared to STA-NB-3.</p>

Four different amplicons on the <italic>NBPF</italic> cDNA were chosen, of which A and C can have several copies in a single <italic>NBPF</italic> transcript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Vandepoele2">[27]</xref>. The top panel shows the location of these amplicons in the standard <italic>NBPF1</italic> transcript. Amplicon A is present in two copies in this particular transcript. Expression levels were normalized to four reference genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Vandesompele1">[19]</xref>, and the lowest value was set to 1. (B) Neuroblastoma cell lines were grouped according to the <italic>NBPF1</italic> status (heterozygous <italic>NBPF1</italic> deletion or not). For all amplicons, this resulted in a median expression level that was lower in cell lines with <italic>NBPF1</italic> loss, and this difference was significant for amplicons A, B and D (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), but not for amplicon C (<italic>p</italic>&#x200A;=&#x200A;0.13). (C) Meta-analysis of the <italic>NBPF</italic> expression level in neuroblastoma tumors using the Oncomine database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Rhodes1">[32]</xref>. The reporter used in the array experiment was derived from <italic>NBPF1</italic>, but due to the high sequence identity among the <italic>NBPF</italic> paralogs, this analysis also represents the expression level of all <italic>NBPF</italic> genes.

        <p>For all amplicons, the median expression level of the <italic>NBPF</italic> family for cell lines with <italic>NBPF1</italic> loss was lower than for cell lines with a normal 1p chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002207-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). For amplicons A, B and D, the difference was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) but for amplicon C it was not (<italic>p</italic>&#x200A;=&#x200A;0.13). Moreover, meta-analysis using the Oncomine database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Rhodes1">[32]</xref> revealed a significantly lower expression level of <italic>NBPF</italic> transcripts in neuroblastomas that relapsed within five years than in those that did not relapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002207-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Asgharzadeh1">[33]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The abovementioned primers amplified all <italic>NBPF</italic> transcripts, but the constitutional translocation disrupted only the <italic>NBPF1</italic> gene, so we also determined the expression profile of this gene specifically. We designed primers located on the 5&#x2032; UTR of the <italic>NBPF1</italic> gene, where it has slightly lower sequence homology with the other <italic>NBPF</italic> paralogs. Specific <italic>NBPF1</italic> amplification was determined by melting curve analysis, which showed a single peak, and by sequence analysis of the amplicon. The expression level of <italic>NBPF1</italic>, determined for a panel of 32 neuroblastoma cell lines, varied widely between the different samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002207-g005">Figure 5</xref>), like it did in the expression analysis of the total <italic>NBPF</italic> family. Interestingly, we did not observe complete loss of <italic>NBPF1</italic> expression in any cell line, as has been described for other genes located in the 1p36 region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Fransson1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-JanoueixLerosey1">[17]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Constitutional chromosomal abnormalities in patients bearing specific tumors have often been used to clone new TSGs. Here, we describe the breakpoint cloning of a constitutional translocation t(1;17)(p36.2;q11.2) present in a neuroblastoma patient. Aberrations in the chromosomal regions involved in this translocation are recurrent in neuroblastoma, and so we hypothesized that this translocation predisposed the patient to the development of neuroblastoma. We cloned both translocation breakpoints and identified on chromosome 1 a novel gene that is interrupted by the translocation. This gene is a member of the recently described <italic>NBPF</italic> gene family, which comprises 22 genes with highly repetitive exon types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Vandepoele2">[27]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Popesco1">[29]</xref>. As these genes are located in regions of segmental duplications on chromosome 1, they show high sequence homology in both coding and non-coding regions.</p>
      <p>Unbalanced translocations between chromosomes 1 and 17 are common in neuroblastomas, but currently it is unclear whether there is a link between these somatic translocations and the constitutional balanced translocation described here. Only a few of the translocation breakpoints have been cloned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Roberts1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Schleiermacher1">[36]</xref>, and no unifying underlying mechanisms for the translocations have been proposed. Two groups reported increased frequency of chromosome 11q translocations in regions of segmental duplications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Stallings1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Selzer1">[38]</xref>. In this respect, is striking that the chromosome 1 breakpoint in the t(1;17) translocation described here is also localized in a region of segmental duplication.</p>
      <p><italic>NBPF1</italic> is located on human chromosome 1p36. Though it is located outside of the smallest region of overlap defined by a large-scale analysis of neuroblastoma tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-White2">[15]</xref>, at least one copy of the region encompassing the <italic>NBPF1</italic> gene is deleted in most neuroblastomas with 1p deletion. Tumor material from the neuroblastoma patient with the constitutional translocation was not available for genetic analysis, so we cannot exclude the possibility that the der(17) was lost in the tumor, leading to loss of the 1p segment distal to the translocation breakpoint. All genes located distal to the <italic>NBPF1</italic> gene would therefore show LOH in the tumor, including a number of recently identified TSGs located in this region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Bagchi1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Welch1">[14]</xref>. Alternatively, as our <italic>NBPF1</italic> expression profiling revealed a decreased expression in neuroblastoma cell lines with a heterozygous deletion of the <italic>NBPF1</italic> locus, it is also possible that <italic>NBPF1</italic> acts as a haploinsufficient gene. The expression pattern of <italic>NBPF1</italic> is reminiscent of the expression analysis of other genes located in the 1p35-36 region, where 15&#x2013;20% of the genes showed a lower expression level in neuroblastoma tumors and cell lines with 1p loss of heterozygosity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-JanoueixLerosey1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Okawa1">[39]</xref>. It has been proposed that the combined diminished expression of these genes, rather than the inactivation of one single classical TSG, could cause the unfavorable outcome associated with 1p deletions in neuroblastoma. In addition to analyzing specifically the <italic>NBPF1</italic> gene, we also analyzed the complete <italic>NBPF</italic> gene family in neuroblastoma cell lines; most amplicons showed a significantly lower expression level in neuroblastoma cell lines with <italic>NBPF1</italic> loss. In these cell lines the deletion was limited to <italic>NBPF1</italic> and <italic>NBPF3</italic>, and the other <italic>NBPF</italic> members, located on chromosome 1q21, apparently cannot fully compensate for the decreased expression of the two deleted <italic>NBPF</italic> genes. Our qRT-PCR analyses were complemented by a meta-analysis using the Oncomine database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Rhodes1">[32]</xref>. These analyses showed decreased <italic>NBPF</italic> levels in neuroblastomas that relapsed within five years. During our previously reported analysis of the <italic>NBPF</italic> family, we detected structural variation in the <italic>NBPF1</italic> gene in different individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Vandepoele2">[27]</xref>. Similar results were reported in large-scale studies investigating copy-number variation between people <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Tuzun1">[30]</xref>. These structural variants of <italic>NBPF1</italic> and its paralogs should be taken into consideration when choosing amplicons and analyzing the expression levels of these genes in different cell lines.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, expression of NBPF1 in a human colorectal cell line severely suppressed soft agar colony formation, demonstrating that NBPF1 might act as a TSG, at least in colon cancer. So far, technical difficulties have prevented us from testing this hypothesis in neuroblastoma cell lines. As colorectal cancer is also characterized by frequent deletions or translocations of 1p36 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Schwab1">[11]</xref>, we believe that our present data is a first step in the elucidation of the potential tumor suppressive properties of <italic>NBPF1</italic>. The underlying mechanism for this <italic>NBPF1</italic> activity is currently unknown.</p>
      <p><italic>ACCN1</italic> encodes an amiloride-sensitive cation channel and can be expressed as two different isoforms differing in their aminoterminal domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Lingueglia1">[26]</xref>. The constitutional translocation in the present patient truncates the longer isoform. Interestingly, restoration of surface expression of this isoform in glioma cells reduces cell growth and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-VilaCarriles1">[40]</xref>, classifying it as a potential tumor suppressor. Meta-analysis of <italic>ACCN1</italic> expression in neuroblastomas showed a correlation between 1p36 LOH and decreased levels of <italic>ACCN1</italic>, but no such correlation was observed between 11q23 LOH and the expression level of <italic>ACCN1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Wang1">[34]</xref>. LOH of 1p36 and of 11q23 are both associated with high-risk disease, but only 1p36 LOH is associated with <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Attiyeh1">[6]</xref>. Another report showed a decreased expression level of <italic>ACCN1</italic> in neuroblastomas with high telomerase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Hiyama1">[41]</xref>. Knockout mice defective in both <italic>ACCN1</italic> isoforms were viable, fertile, and showed no morphological or behavioral abnormalities, but did indicate that <italic>ACCN1</italic> has a role in retinal function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Ettaiche1">[42]</xref>. No data have been reported on tumor incidence or tumor aggressiveness in these mice. The most frequent chromosomal abnormality in neuroblastomas is gain of chromosome 17 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Vandesompele2">[43]</xref>, which appears to conflict with a potential tumor suppressor function for <italic>ACCN1</italic> in neuroblastoma. However, most 17q breakpoints are distal to <italic>ACCN1</italic>, and it has been suggested that the 17q12 region might contain a gene that suppresses neuroblastoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Lastowska1">[44]</xref>. These data warrant further investigation into the role of <italic>ACCN1</italic> in neuroblastoma. Additionally, it remains possible that the translocation analyzed here affects an unidentified gene in the <italic>ACCN1</italic> intron in which the translocation breakpoint lies. In this region we observed two putative promoter sequences, as predicted by FirstEF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002207-Davuluri1">[45]</xref>, and a small number of ESTs not annotated to a known gene and devoid of a meaningful open reading frame (data not shown). It is not clear whether these sequences have a function or are merely the result of random transcriptional activation.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we describe the molecular cloning of both translocation breakpoints in a neuroblastoma patient with a constitutional t(1;17) translocation. Genes overlapping both translocation breakpoints were identified, namely <italic>NBPF1</italic> on chromosome 1 and <italic>ACCN1</italic> on chromosome 17. Further research might reveal the role of the disruption of both of these genes in the development and progression of neuroblastoma.</p>
