  <body>
    <p>A 38-year-old female presented to us with a history of fluctuating blood pressure. On physical examination, her blood pressure in the right arm was 180/110 mmHg. Physical examination revealed no other abnormalities. Her laboratory parameters were within normal limits. Renal artery duplex ultrasound was suggestive of significant stenosis in the left renal artery.</p>
    <p>Subsequent renal angiography demonstrated a classical "string of beads" appearance of both the renal arteries (saccular dilatations and constrictions) that spared the ostium; this was suggestive of fibromuscular dysplasia. The left renal artery also exhibited short-segment web-like stenosis (70% to 80%) in the mid-segment with a significant gradient across it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Angioplasty of the stenotic segment was performed using an angioplasty balloon at a pressure of 10 atmospheres with good results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). After angioplasty, the patient's blood pressure normalized and she was discharged without any antihypertensive medications. At the 6-month follow-up, her blood pressure remained normal and she required no antihypertensive medications.</p>
    <p>Fibromuscular dysplasia is a noninflammatory, nonatherosclerotic vascular disease that commonly involves the renal and internal carotid arteries; however, it can involve any arterial bed. Renal fibromuscular dysplasia usually affects females from 15 to 50 years of age and accounts for around 10% of cases of renal artery stenosis. Renal fibromuscular dysplasia is classified based on the predominant arterial layer involved: intima, media, or adventitia. Involvement of the media is further subdivided into medial, perimedial, and hyperplastic medial fibromuscular dysplasia. The three most common and classically described subtypes include medial (70% of cases), perimedial (15% to 25%), and intimal fibrodysplasias (1% to 2%). The classical angiographic "string of beads" appearance is seen in medial and perimedial fibromuscular dysplasias. It is characterized by alternating stenoses and aneurysms and frequently involves the bilateral renal arteries.</p>
    <p>The most accurate method for diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia remains catheter-based angiography.</p>
