      <abstract>
        <p>Primary erythromelalgia (PE) is an autosomal dominant neurological disorder characterized by severe burning pain and erythema in the extremities upon heat stimuli or exercise. Mutations in human <italic>SCN9A</italic> gene, encoding the &#x3B1;&#x2013;subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel, Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, were found to be responsible for PE. Three missense mutations of <italic>SCN9A</italic> gene have recently been identified in Taiwanese patients including a familial (I136V) and two sporadic mutations (I848T, V1316A). V1316A is a novel mutation and has not been characterized yet. Topologically, I136V is located in DI/S1 segment and both I848T and V1316A are located in S4-S5 linker region of DII and DIII domains, respectively. To characterize the elelctrophysiological manifestations, the channel conductance with whole-cell patch clamp was recorded on the over-expressed Chinese hamster overy cells. As compared with wild type, the mutant channels showed a significant hyperpolarizing shift in voltage dependent activation and a depolarizing shift in steady-state fast inactivation. The recovery time from channel inactivation is faster in the mutant than in the wild type channels. Since warmth can trigger and exacerbate symptoms, we then examine the influence of tempearture on the sodium channel conduction. At 35&#xB0;C, I136V and V1316A mutant channels exhibit a further hyperpolarizing shift at activation as compared with wild type channel, even though wild type channel also produced a significant hyperpolarizing shift compared to that of 25&#xB0;C. High temperature caused a significant depolarizing shift in steady-state fast inactivation in all three mutant channels. These findings may confer to the hyperexcitability of sensory neurons, especially at high temperature. In order to identifying an effective treatment, we tested the IC<sub>50</sub> values of selective sodium channel blockers, lidocaine and mexiletine. The IC<sub>50</sub> for mexiletine is lower for I848T mutant channel as compared to that of the wild type and other two mutants which is comparable to the clinical observations.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Erythromelalgia (or erythermalgia; OMIM 133020) is a rare neurovascular pain disorder characterized by intermittent severe burning pain, erythema and elevation of temperature in the extremities. It was first named and described in 1878 by Dr. Mitchell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Mitchell1">[1]</xref>. The symptoms are usually bilateral and symmetrical, and they are most often confined in lower extremities but can extend to hands and sometimes earlobes and nose tip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Drenth1">[2]</xref>. Primary erythromelalgia (PE, or inherited erythromelalgia, IEM) can be hereditary or sporadic. Familial PE transmitted by an autosomal dominant manner. The age of onset for PE is usually before the first decade of life (as early as months after birth) but can also be adult onset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-DibHajj1">[3]</xref>. The symptoms appear to persist and progressively worsen throughout life for most patients, although some patients reported to show improvement even complete resolution of symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Davis1">[4]</xref>. The painful attacks can be evoked by warm stimuli and moderate exercises. It was described that the critical temperature lies within the range of 32&#x2013;36&#xB0;C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Babb1">[5]</xref>. Patients therefore are compelled not to wear socks or closed shoes even in winter. An attack can last from minutes to hours and even days in some cases. Patients can relieve symptoms by elevating affected limbs or submerging affected areas in cold water but by doing so too often, patients might suffer from skin infections. There has not been an effective treatment for PE. In a report of 168 patients with erythromelalgia, 84 medications or treatments (sodium channel blockers, sympathetic blocks, etc.) were used and showed high variability and no treatment is consistently effective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Davis1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Genetic linkage locus was found at chromosome 2 from a large kindred of five generations with multiple family members affected with PE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Drenth1">[2]</xref>. Analysis of recombination events identified the D2S2370 and D2S1776 as flanking markers in chromosome 2q31-32 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Drenth1">[2]</xref>. Subsequently Yang <italic>et</italic>
<italic>al.</italic> further refined the linkage to a 5.98 cM region in chromosome 2q24.2-q24.3. By sequencing the selected candidate genes, two missense mutations (I848T, L858F) were found in <italic>SCN9A</italic> gene in the family and a sporadic patient with PE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Yang1">[6]</xref>. Human <italic>SCN9A</italic> gene contains 26 exons and encodes for the &#x3B1;-subunit of voltage-gated sodium channel, Na<sub>v</sub>1.7. To date 19 mutations in <italic>SCN9A</italic> gene have been reported relating to PE, including 18 missense mutations causing single amino acid substitution and one in-frame deletion. The penetrance is nearly 100% for PE mutations.</p>
      <p>Voltage-gated sodium channel (Na<sub>v</sub>) comprises of a family of nine structurally related pore forming &#x3B1;-subunits (Na<sub>v</sub>1.1&#x2013;1.9) and a family of accessory &#x3B2;-subunits (&#x3B2;1&#x2013; &#x3B2;4). These channels are encoded by <italic>SCN1A &#x2013; SCN5A</italic> and <italic>SCN8A &#x2013; SCN11A</italic> genes for the &#x3B1;-subunits, and <italic>SCN1B &#x2013; SCN4B</italic> genes for the &#x3B2;-subunits. The &#x3B1;-subunit is a &#x223C;260 kDa pore forming protein consisting of four homologous domains (DI &#x2013; DIV) and six transmembrane segments (S1&#x2013; S6) in each domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

          <p>(A) A point mutation c.2543T&gt;C in exon 15 results in a missense mutation of isoleucine 848 changed to threonine was found in patient A, but not her parents. Amino acid sequence alignment for I848T in the right panel demonstrates this amino acid is highly conserved among different species and variable sodium channels. (B) A point missense mutation of c.3947T&gt;C in exon 22 results in valine 1316 changed to alanine in patient B. Her parents do not harbor the sequence variant. The sequence alignment demonstrates the highly conserved amino acid, isoleucine1316. (C) There are 19 missense and one in-frame deletion mutations that have been identified so far relating to primary erythromelalgia. The gray annotations are polymorphisms that are not directly linked with PE. Mutations analyzed in this study are denoted with blue boxes. (This figure is modified from a figure previously published by Waxman and Dig-Hajj (2005) in &#x201C;Erythermalgia: molecular basis for an inherited pain syndrome&#x201D;, Trends in Molecular Medicine, 11(12), 555&#x2013;562 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Waxman1">[37]</xref>.).</p>

      <p>Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 is composed of 1977 amino acids (&#x223C;225 kDa), which is predominantly expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and sympathetic ganglion neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-ToledoAral1">[7]</xref>. It produces rapid activating and inactivating current that is sensitive to TTX blockade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Rogers1">[8]</xref>. In the DRG, Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 is concentrated in small C fiber nociceptors and to a lesser extent in medium-sized A&#x3B4; and large A&#x3B2; cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Djouhri1">[9]</xref>. Immunohistochemical studies showed that Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 is present at the distal ends of neurites, close to the impulse trigger zone where neuronal firing is initiated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Drenth2">[10]</xref>. Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 is characterized by slow recovery from inactivation and slow closed-state inactivation, which allows Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channels to respond to slow ramp depolarizations and amplify generation potentials at nerve terminals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Drenth2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Cummins1">[11]</xref>. Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 is therefore like a &#x201C;threshold channel&#x201D; that amplifies small, subtle depolarizations and brings membrane potential to more depolarized state to activate Na<sub>v</sub>1.8, which is responsible for most of the rising phase of action potentials. Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 is poised as a molecular gatekeeper of pain detection at peripheral nociceptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Drenth2">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to PE, mutations in <italic>SCN9A</italic> gene can also result in paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD; OMIM 167400) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Fertleman1">[12]</xref> and congenital insensitivity (or indifference) to pain (CIP; OMIM 243000) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Cox1">[13]</xref>. PEPD is an autosomal dominant pain disorder caused by gain-of-function mutations in <italic>SCN9A</italic> gene, but CIP resulted from loss-of-function and transmitted in a recessive pattern. Furthermore, gain-of-function mutations in <italic>SCN9A</italic> gene were found to be associated with idiopathic small fiber neuropathy (I-SFN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Faber1">[14]</xref>. Eight out of 28 patients (28.6%) with I-SFN were screened positive for novel mutations in <italic>SCN9A</italic> gene and subsequent electrophysiological analyses revealed multiple gain-of-function changes in the mutant channels. Each of the mutations confers to the hyperexcitable DRG neurons. The results suggest an etiological basis for I-SFN, whereby expression of gain-of-function mutant Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channels in small diameter peripheral axons, may cause these fibers to degenerate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Faber1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study we report a sporadic mutation, I848T as well as a novel mutation, V1316A in <italic>SCN9A</italic> gene from Taiwanese patients. Together with the previous reported I136V mutant channel, we characterized the basic electrophysiological properties and evaluated how increased temperature can modulate the gating properties of these mutant channels in CHO-K1 cells. In addition, since treatments for PE have only been partially successful and seem to be mutation specific, we assessed the differential inhibition of sodium channel blockers on these mutant channels and using the electrophysiological parameters as a tool to screen for the potential treatments in these patients.</p>

        <title>Study Patients</title>
        <p>Three mutations have recently been identified in Taiwanese patients who were diagnosed with primary erythromelalgia (PE). The diagnostic criteria for erythromelalgia include: 1) burning pain of extremities, 2) pain aggravated by warming, 3) pain relieved by cooling, 4) erythema of the affected skin, and 5) increased temperature of the affected skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Drenth3">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Thompson1">[16]</xref>. Differential diagnosis including reflex sympathetic dystrophy, Fabry&#x2019;s disease, and other painful neuropathies associated with diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, HIV infection and Lyme disease were excluded. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants following ethical practices approved by the institutional review board of National Taiwan University Hospital Ethics Committee. The written inform consent has been obtained from the parents of the juvenile patients under 18 years of age.</p>

        <title>Patient A</title>
        <p>Patient A is a 33-year-old female diagnosed with PE about three years ago at National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. She suffered from burning pain and erythema in her feet since she was eight years old. At hot weather, the feet developed severe burning pain with reddish skin discoloration. Her palms were affected as well in recent decade. Walking and warmth trigger the symptoms, which made difficulties for her to wear shoes and socks. To relieve foot pain, she preferred to have her feet immersed in water and even on ice to gain pain relief. Mexiletine and acetaminophen have been prescribed with mild improvement in pain scale. There is no family history and her parents are unremarkable.</p>

      <sec id="s2c">
        <title>Patient B</title>
        <p>Patient B was a 16-year-old girl upon her first visit to National Taiwan University Hospital. The chief complaint was the recurrent severe burning pain of both feet since age seven. The symptoms affecting both feet symmetrically, and gradually extended to bilateral knees and hands in recent months. Various medications such as aspirin, mexiletine, carbamazepine, propranolol, gabapentin, and imipramine have been prescribed but only little effect was observed. To relieve pain, she had to immerse her hands and feet in ice water at night. Nevertheless, prolonged immersion in ice-cold water with small wound resulted in infection associated with blisters and cellulitis. Local heating due to inflammation aggravated the causalgia and burning pain of both feet. Unfortunately, neurogenic shock with collapse took place due to severe pain after debridement surgery of her feet.</p>

        <title>Genetic Analysis</title>
        <p>Three missense mutations, one familial (I136V) and two sporadic mutations (I848T, V1316A) of <italic>SCN9A</italic> gene were identified in Taiwanese patients with primary erythromelalgia (PE). The familial mutation, isoleucine136 changed to valine (I136V), was previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Lee1">[18]</xref>, and its electrophysiological property was subsequently characterized by whole-cell patch clamp in HEK293 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Cheng1">[19]</xref>. Isoleucine136 is located at the first transmembrane segment of domain I (DI/S1) of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7. In addition, two more cases, patient-A and &#x2013;B were referred to our clinic without a positive family history. Patient A was a 33 year old female who developed excruciating burning pain at hot weather or in feverish at her young age. There were no symptoms of motor dysfunction. Although severe pain occurred, no hypo-, hyperesthesia or allodynia were found on her feet. She also denied any history of diabetes, autoimmune disease or Raynaud&#x2019;s phenomenon. On examination, the feet were reddish and warm. There were no motor weakness, no muscle atrophy and no sensory loss on all sensory modality. The clinical electrophysiological data, including nerve conduction, variance of R-R interval and sympathetic skin response tests, were all unremarkable. The blood biochemistry and autoimmune profiles were normal. Given the typical phenotype of PE, sequencing of <italic>SCN9A</italic> gene in patient A showed a &#x201C;T&#x201D; to &#x201C;C&#x201D; substitution at nucleotide 2543 at exon 15 (reference sequence GeneBank NM_002977), which resulted in a missense mutation of isoleucine848 changing to threonine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The I848T is a de novo mutation since her parents do not harbor the sequence variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Isoleucine848 is located in the intracellular linker region between the fourth and fifth transmembrane segments of domain II (DII/S4-S5) as shown in the upper panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>. The same mutation was previously reported in three sporadic cases of Chinese patients and two familial cases (English and French) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Yang1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Drenth4">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Natkunarajah1">[21]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Patient B is also a sporadic case, who suffered from the typical phenotype of PE. The age of onset is at year 7 with progressive course implying a genetic disorder. She could not tolerate the severe feet burning pain but to immerse them with water or ice water. Inflammation with blisters and wounds on skin of both pedal regions ascending to mid-calf level further aggravated the erythromelalgia. Unfortunately, pain with autonomic instability resulted in neurogenic shock and she passed away after debridement. Sequencing of SCN9A gene in the patient identified a transversion of nucleotide &#x201C;T&#x201D; to &#x201C;C&#x201D; change at position 3947 (exon 22), but not in her parents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The novel mutation, V1316A, is located in the intracellular linker region between fourth and fifth transmembrane segments of domain III (DIII/S4-S5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Sequence alignments showed that the amino acids (I136, I848 and V1316), which mutated are highly conserved among human voltage-gated sodium channel &#x3B1;-subunit subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g001">Fig. 1A and 1B</xref>). They are also highly conserved among Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 homologs of various species during evolution. The conservation of amino acids at these positions suggest that mutations occur at these positions are likely to alter channel properties. These three mutations were not identified in 200 Taiwanese healthy controls.</p>

        <p>To characterize the electrophysiological properties of these PE related mutant Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channels, both wild type and mutant channels were over-expressed in CHO-K1 cells together with human SCN1B/2B &#x3B2;-subunits. The successful expression of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 protein on the transfected cell membrane was demonstrated by Western blotting and immunofluorescent studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055212.s004">Fig. S4 &amp; S5</xref>).</p>
        <p>Using whole-cell patch clamp recording, the current-voltage relationships of wild type and mutant channels were recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Cells were held at &#x2212;100 mV and stepped to a range of potentials (&#x2212;80 &#x223C; +30 mV with 5 mV increment) for 50 ms to record the current amplitude that was induced at each voltage step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The current-voltage (I-V) curves showed that there is a hyperpolarizing shift in voltage dependent activation for mutant channels with no apparent shift in reversal potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g002">Fig. 2B&#x2013;D</xref>). Mutant channels were activated and reached maximal current amplitude at more hyperpolarized potential as compared with wild type channel. To obtain activation curves, normalized conductance was fitted with Boltzmann equation, and the half maximal activation potential (activation V<sub>1/2</sub>) of each channel was calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g002">Fig. 2E&#x2013;G</xref>). All mutant channels produce a significant (P&lt;0.001) hyperpolarizing shift in activation V<sub>1/2</sub> compared with wild type channel (&#x2212;25.88&#xB1;0.35 mV, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;30) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g002">Fig. 2H</xref>). I136V mutant channel has the largest shift (&#x2212;35.32&#xB1;0.33 mV, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;26) among all mutant channels (I848T: &#x2212;30.84&#xB1;0.39 mV, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;25; V1316A: &#x2212;32.68&#xB1;0.44 mV, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;31). The slope factors of activation curves are similar except for V1316A mutant channel (6.01&#xB1;0.39, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;31), which has a significant (P&lt;0.05) increase as compared with wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g002">Fig. 2I</xref>).

        <title>Temperature Effect</title>
        <p>Since warmth evokes and worsens symptoms and PE patients feel relieved after cooling, we therefore assessed the effect of temperature on wild type and mutant Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channels. Both voltage dependent activation and steady-state fast inactivation were analyzed at 25&#xB0;C and 35&#xB0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055212-t001">Table 1A &amp; 1B</xref>). At 25&#xB0;C, all the mutant channels had significant (P&lt;0.001) hyperpolarizing shift (I136V: &#x2212;34.24&#xB1;0.72 mV, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;13; I848T: &#x2212;29.60&#xB1;0.50 mV, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;20; V1316A: &#x2212;29.78&#xB1;0.59 mV, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;19) in activation V<sub>1/2</sub> compared with wild type channel (&#x2212;22.07&#xB1;0.31 mV, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;29) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055212-t001">Table 1A</xref>). Increase of temperature significantly (P&lt;0.001) hyperpolarized the activation V<sub>1/2</sub> of wild type (&#x2212;26.22&#xB1;0.55 mV, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;15), and V1316A (&#x2212;33.45&#xB1;0.53 mV, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;14) mutant channel (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055212-t001">Table 1B</xref>). But, there was no effect on I136V mutant channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g005">Fig. 5B &amp; 5D</xref>). However, both mutant channels still had more hyperpolarized activation V<sub>1/2</sub> compared with wild type channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055212-t001">Table 1B</xref>). On the contrary, I848T mutant channel produced a depolarizing shift of &#x223C;4 mV (P&lt;0.001, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;19) and therefore resulted in no difference from wild type channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g005">Fig. 5C &amp; 5E</xref>). The activation curves of I848T and V1316A at 25&#xB0;C were less steep as compared with the wild type channel, whereas at 35&#xB0;C there was no significant difference between mutant and wild type channels. V1316A mutant channel at 35&#xB0;C had steeper slope as compared to that at 25&#xB0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>).</p>

        <p>Currently treatments for PE using sodium channel blockers such as local anesthetics (<italic>e.g.</italic> lidocaine), anti-convulsants (<italic>e.g.</italic> carbamazepine, phenytoin), or tricyclic antidepressants (<italic>e.g.</italic> imipramine) have only been partially successful. We sought to use electrophysiology to screen for drugs that are potentially effective for patients with these three mutations. Normalized peak currents induced by depolarizing from &#x2212;100 to &#x2212;20 mV with various concentrations of drugs were assessed and those showing 50% inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub>) were calcuated by fitting with logistic equation. We first tested the IC<sub>50</sub> values of a local anesthetic, lidocaine, for wild type and mutant Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channels. All three mutant channels seem to be more resistant to lidocaine blockade with significant higher IC<sub>50</sub> values (I136V: 3.95&#xB1;1.58 mM, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;5; I848T: 3.11&#xB1;0.48 mM, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;7; V1316A: 7.92&#xB1;2.50 mM, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;4) compared with wild type channel (1.31&#xB1;0.87 mM, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Furthermore, wild type channel had an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.77&#xB1;0.78 mM (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;6) of mexiletine to inhibit half of the sodium conductance. The I136V (2.03&#xB1;0.38 mM, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;7) and V1316A (1.73&#xB1;0.20 mM, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;8) mutant channels revealed similar IC<sub>50</sub> values as wild type channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g008">Fig. 8B &amp; 8D</xref>), while I848T mutant channel resulted in a significant lower (1.08&#xB1;0.11 mM, P&lt;0.05, n&#x200A;=&#x200A;7) IC<sub>50</sub> for mexiletine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>). These results indicate that lidocaine is not be suitable for the patients; however, mexiletine might be an alternative choice, especially in the patient with I848T mutation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In addition to reporting of a novel mutation V1316A, the electrophysiological properties for the three mutations (one familial, I136V and two sporadic, I848T &amp; V1316A) were also evaluated in our study. Electrophysiologically, these mutations increased the sodium channel activity, which may result in hyperexcitability of sensory neurons. The hyper-activity of mutant Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channels can be further enhanced at higher temperature. In search of effective treatment for PE, we found the differential inhibition of sodium channel blockers on these mutant Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channels.</p>
      <sec id="s4a">
        <title>Genetic Analysis</title>
        <p>For electrophysiological study, we included all three mutations that were found in Taiwanese patients. Protein sequence alignments show that these amino acids (I136, I848, and V1316) are highly conserved during evolution and also among other voltage-gated sodium channel &#x3B1;-subunit subtypes, with an exception in I136 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g001">Fig. 1A &amp; 1B</xref>). I136V is located in D1S1 transmembrane segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), which has not been implicated in channel gating. However, it was shown that the S1&#x2013; S3 segments form a narrow groove, which voltage sensor S4 slides along in an electric field by interacting with the negatively charged residues in neighboring transmembrane segments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-YarovYarovoy1">[22]</xref>. The substitution of isoleucine with valine might alter the conformation of the &#x201C;groove&#x201D; and as a result affect the voltage sensing and channel gating.</p>
        <p>The missense mutation, V1316A is a novel mutation. The valine1316 is conserved among the species and sodium channel family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The I848T mutation has previously been identified in three sporadic case from China and two familial cases from England and France <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Yang1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Drenth4">[20]</xref>. It occurs most frequent as compared to all the other mutations in <italic>SCN9A</italic> gene resulting in PE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). It occurs among variable ethnic groups of patients and could probably be a mutation hotspot. I848T and V1316A are both located on the intracellular loop linking transmembrane segment S4 and S5 of domain II and III respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Upon membrane depolarization, the voltage sensor S4 segment spirals outward and pulls on the S4/S5 linker, which induces movement of S5 and S6 segment and opens the channel pore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-YarovYarovoy1">[22]</xref>. Isoleucine848 is a nonpolar, neutral amino acid. Since threonine harbors a polar side chain, the replacing isoleucine by threonine might cause conformation change. Valine1316 is a nonpolar, neutral, and branched amino acid, while alanine is also nonpolar and neutral but structurally a much smaller amino acid. Both mutations, I848T and V1316A located on the S4/S5 linker might change the conformation of the linkers with S5 and S6 segments that is critical for channel gating. To authenticate a pathogenic mutation of these three sequence variants, the characterization of electrophysiological features would provide the direct evidence.</p>

        <title>Basic Electrophysiological Properties</title>
        <p>The mutant Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channels harboring the I136V, I848T, and V1316A mutations resulted in hyperpolarizing shift in voltage dependent activation and depolarizing shift of the inactivation V<sub>1/2</sub> of steady-state fast inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g002">Fig. 2</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g003">3</xref>). Moreover, all three mutant channels recovered significantly faster from inactivation as compared with wild type channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Hyperpolarizing shift of activation threshold and the activation V<sub>1/2</sub> would increase the channel sensitivity. Only V1316A mutant channel showed change in slope of the activation curve, which was less steep than wild type channel. This is due to the greater hyperpolarizing shift of activation threshold without much shift in the maximum current. Hyperpolarizing shift in activation together with the depolarizing shift in inactivation V<sub>1/2</sub> might increase the window current which may result in depolarizing resting membrane potential of sensory neurons as previously demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Choi1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Harty1">[24]</xref>. The faster recovery from inactivation back to available state allows the mutant channels to be reactivated more rapidly than wild type channel, which contributes to hyper-activity of these mutant channels. Since no apparent difference was observed in reversal potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g002">Fig. 2B</xref> &#x223C; 2D), we reason that the changes in gating property is not due to permeation of other ions. Several mutations related to PE are located at the S4/S5 linker regions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055212-t002">Table 2</xref>), but there is no distinct property change in these regions compared with other mutations. It is still unclear why mutations located at different positions result in similar functional changes.</p>

        <p>The electrophysiological data such as hyperpolarizing shift in voltage dependent activation for I136V and I848T mutant channels are comparable with previous studies, but not the steady-state fast inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Cheng1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Cummins2">[30]</xref>. It has been reported that no significant shift in inactivation V<sub>1/2</sub> in both I136V and I848T mutant channels except the steeper slope for I136V inactivation as compared with wild type channel. The discrepancy might be due to different expression systems. The previous studies were performed in HEK293 cells as oppose to CHO-K1 cells in our study. The HEK293 cells have a negative resting membrane potential and some cells express voltage-dependent sodium currents, whereas CHO-K1 cells we used have resting membrane potential close to 0 mV and do not express any detectable voltage-dependent sodium current. Additionally, the expression construct of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channel used by Cheng <italic>et</italic>
<italic>al</italic>. (2008) and Cummins <italic>et</italic>
<italic>al</italic>. (2004) was converted to TTX-R form, and electrophysiological recordings were conducted with TTX blockade of endogenous sodium current in HEK293 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Cheng1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Cummins2">[30]</xref>. The amino acid change for TTX sensitivity and different cell background might be the reason for different results. Therefore we only compared our findings to the wild type control in our system.</p>

        <title>Temperature Effect</title>
        <p>It was reported by Babb et al. (1964) that the critical range of temperature, which triggers the painful attacks in erythromelalgia is 32&#x2013;36&#xB0;C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Babb1">[5]</xref>. Temperature is a critical factor to trigger the clinical features of PE. Han <italic>et</italic>
<italic>al</italic>. found that cooling differentially shifts the midpoint of steady-state activation in depolarizing direction for L858F but not for wild type channels, which is likely to contribute to the alleviation of painful symptoms upon cooling in affected limbs in PE patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Han2">[34]</xref>. Therefore we assessed the gating property change in wild type and I136V, I848T, and V1316A mutant channels at 35&#xB0;C compared to control of 25&#xB0;C. In voltage dependent activation, our results showed that high temperature (35&#xB0;C) could significantly hyperpolarize the activation V<sub>1/2</sub> in wild type and V1316A mutant Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channels but no change in the I136V one. The activation V<sub>1/2</sub> of both I136V and V1316A mutant channels were still significantly more hyperpolarized as compared with wild type channel at 35&#xB0;C. Surprisingly, I848T mutant channel shifted the activation V<sub>1/2</sub> in depolarizing direction, which results in no significant difference from wild type channel at 35&#xB0;C. The inactivation V<sub>1/2</sub> of steady-state fast inactivation was not altered for wild type channel at 35&#xB0;C. However, increasing temperature further depolarized the inactivation V<sub>1/2</sub> of all three mutant channels.</p>
        <p>Since wild type channel also exhibited hyperpolarizing shift in activation at 35&#xB0;C, increasing temperature triggers the painful attacks in PE is probably due to the depolarizing of steady-state fast inactivation, which enhances the hyper-activity of mutant channels. Among three mutations, only V1316A mutant channel produced both hyperpolarizing shift in activation V<sub>1/2</sub> and depolarizing shift in inactivation V<sub>1/2</sub> while temperature shifts from 25&#xB0;C to 35&#xB0;C. These results are comparable to clinical observations while patient B (V1316A) presented with more severe symptoms as compared to the patients with the other two mutations. The depolarizing shift of voltage dependent activation observed in I848T mutant channel at 35&#xB0;C is expected to counteract the depolarization in steady-state fast inactivation. However, the depolarization in activation does not result in further depolarizing shift as compared with wild type channel at 35&#xB0;C and it is possible that the shift in steady-state fast inactivation alone contributes to the disease phenotype. The results could also be explained by the contribution of sympathetic nervous system, where Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 is also expressed abundantly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-ToledoAral1">[7]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Recent report has shown that neuropathic pain is resulted from the interaction between sympathetic and sensory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Minett1">[38]</xref>. The effects of indifference and depolarizing shift of activation observed in I136V and I848T may be implicated in sympathetic neurons. Further characterizations in whether these mutations produce hyper- or hypo-excitability in sympathetic neurons, and how they interact with the hyperexcitable sensory neurons will help elucidating the pathophysiology of PE.</p>

        <title>Drug Antagonism</title>
        <p>The differential inhibitions of clinically available medications for PE were tested on wild type and mutant Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channels. The significant higher IC<sub>50</sub> values for lidocaine observed in I136V, I848T, and V1316A mutant Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channels suggest that lidocaine might not be a suitable treatment choice for patients with these mutations. In testing the mexiletine, only I848T mutant channel revealed a significant lower IC<sub>50</sub> as compared with wild type channel. This result is compatible with the clinical observation that the visual analogue scale decreased in patient A (I848T) but not patient B (V1316A) after the mexiletine treatment. Although partial improvement was also observed in the patient carrying I136V mutation, there was no significant difference in IC<sub>50</sub> as compared with wild type channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055212-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). Previous study on another PE relating mutation, V872G showed similar IC<sub>50</sub> for mexiletine but exhibited greater use-dependent current fall-off as compared with wild type channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Choi3">[29]</xref>. However, no difference was observed in our mutant channels compared with wild type channel in use-dependent assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0055212.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). Considering the disease phenotype might be resulted from interactions between sympathetic and sensory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055212-Minett1">[38]</xref>, treatments that aim to attenuate the activity of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 in sensory neurons would be expected to be only partially effective. Although our results do not completely match the clinical observation, our method to some degree can still provide a quick screen for potential treatments for these patients.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>Results from our study showed that the I136V, I848T, and V1316A mutant Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channels exhibit altered electrophysiological properties that result in channel hyper-activity, which confers to the hyperexcitability in sensory neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrated that at higher temperature (35&#xB0;C) to trigger PE symptoms, the hypersensitivity of mutant channels was accentuated and resulting in disease phenotype such as neuralgia and causalgia. Characterization of these mutant Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channels in sensory and sympathetic neurons needs further investigation to unraveling the disease mechanism of PE.</p>
