          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Laterality defects are rare in cattle and usually manifest as asplenia or
polysplenia syndrome. These syndromes may be associated with situs ambiguus,
which is a dislocation of some but not all internal organs. The objective of
this report was to describe the clinical and post-mortem findings including
the macroscopic and microscopic anatomy of selected organs in a cow with
polysplenia and situs ambiguus.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Case presentation</title>
          <p>A 3.5-year-old Brown Swiss cow was referred to the Department of Farm
Animals, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, because of poor appetite
and recurrent indigestion. A diagnosis of situs ambiguus was based on the
results of physical examination, ultrasonography, exploratory laparotomy and
post-mortem examination. The latter revealed that the rumen was on the right
side and lacked compartmentalisation. There were two spleens, one on the
left (26.5 x 12.0 cm) and one on the right (20.5 x 5.5 cm), and the omasum
was located craniolateral to the ruminoreticulum on the left. The abomasum
was located on the right, although it had initially been displaced to the
left. The three-lobed liver occupied the left and central cranioventral
aspect of the abdominal cavity (cavum abdominis). Only the right and left
hepatic veins (vena hepatica dextra and sinistra) drained into the thoracic
segment of the caudal vena cava (vena cava caudalis), and histological
changes in the liver were indicative of impaired haemodynamics. The
mesojejunum was not fused with the mesentery of the spiral loop (ansa
spiralis) of the ascending colon (colon ascendens). The latter was folded
and the transverse colon (colon transversum) ran caudal to the cranial
mesenteric artery (arteria mesenteria cranialis). Fibrotic constrictions
were seen in the lumen of the caecum and proximal loop (ansa proximalis) of
the ascending colon. Both kidneys were positioned retroperitoneally in a
lumbar position. The lumbar segment of the caudal vena cava did not descend
to the liver and instead drained into the right azygous vein (vena azygos
dextra).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Recurrent digestive problems and poor production in this patient may have
been caused by a lack of rumen compartmentalisation, abnormal abomasal
motility, constrictions in the large intestine (intestinum crassum) and
fibrosis of the liver. The abomasum had abnormal motility most likely
because it was anchored inadequately and only at its cranial aspect to the
liver by the lesser omentum (omentum minus) and to the dorsal abdominal wall
and rumen by a short greater omentum (omentum majus).</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Laterality defects are very rare in domestic animals. Situs inversus is the most
common laterality defect in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) also known as Kartagener&#x2019;s
syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], is thought to be the primary cause of this condition, which is often
associated with recurrent chronic respiratory problems including bronchiectasia and
chronic rhinitis. The few reports on laterality defects in ruminants deal with
post-mortem findings in cattle and sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. There have been only two cases of heterotaxy
(&#x201C;heteros&#x201D;&#x2009;=&#x2009;other and
&#x201C;taxis&#x201D;&#x2009;=&#x2009;arrangement) described in cattle and they were
referred to as situs inversus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], although at least one of these reports was restricted to intra-thoracic
organs, and both were not well documented. The anatomical findings in most of the
documented cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] can be best characterised as situs ambiguus, which can be divided into
asplenia (right isomerism) and polysplenia (left isomerism). These conditions are
also assumed to be morphological correlates of PCD in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It has been shown that several gene defects are correlated with PCD and
thus with laterality defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In humans, PCD is a genetically heterogeneous disorder with an autosomal
recessive mode of inheritance in most cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p>
      <p>To the authors&#x2019; knowledge, this is the first detailed case report of a situs
ambiguus in a cow. Because not all organs were reversed from their normal positions,
and some organs had specific deviations from normal in addition to heterotaxy, this
case was not diagnosed as situs inversus. The findings serve to expand our knowledge
about the clinical signs, functional implications and topography of internal organs
in cattle with situs ambiguus.</p>

        <title>Animal and methods</title>
        <p>A three-year-old, non-pregnant primiparous Brown Swiss cow, which had previously
produced a live calf was referred to the Department of Farm Animals, Vetsuisse
Faculty, University of Zurich, because of poor body condition and a tentative
diagnosis of caecal dilatation. The cow was small for its age and therefore bred
late, resulting in an age at first calving of 39 months. The cow was often seen
ruminating but had a history of poor appetite, and production during early
lactation was two thirds of the herd average. The cow resumed ovarian cyclicity
and was inseminated twice post partum but did not conceive. The animal underwent
clinical and ultrasonographic examinations and blood was collected for
haematological and biochemical analyses. Haematocrit, total leukocyte count and
the concentrations of fibrinogen and total protein from EDTA blood samples were
determined on an automated blood analyser (CELL-Dyn 3500, Abbott Diagnostics
Division, Baar). The concentrations of serum bilirubin, urea nitrogen, sodium,
chloride, potassium, calcium, inorganic phosphorus and magnesium were determined
at 37&#xB0;C using an automated analyser (Cobas-Integra-800-Analyser, Roche
Diagnostics, Basel) and the manufacturer&#x2019;s reagents (Roche-Reagents)
according to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory
Medicine (IFCC). Rumen fluid was collected using a stomach tube and the chloride
concentration measured with an MK-II-Chloride Analyser 9265 (Sherwood,
Cambridge). Results were compared with reference values established at this
clinic.</p>
        <p>A standing right-flank exploratory laparotomy was done because of apparent
abnormalities in the topography of the abdominal organs, suspected caecal
dilatation and left displacement of the abomasum. During laparotomy it was
confirmed that the abdominal organs were arranged in a mirror image reversal of
the normal positioning. The left dorsal displacement of the abomasum was
corrected and the general condition of the patient improved and the cow was
discharged five days postoperatively.</p>
        <p>The cow was re-admitted to the clinic 2.5 months later because she failed to gain
weight and milk production remained poor. Because of a grave prognosis, the cow
was euthanised, exsanguinated, fixed in standing position with 2.8% formaldehyde
administered through the common carotid artery (arteria carotis communis), and
necropsied. Samples of the mucosa of nasal conchae (conchae nasales), frontal
sinus (sinus frontalis) and trachea were collected and routinely processed for
scanning and transmission electron microscopy for the examination of the
presence and structural integrity of ciliated cells. Samples of liver tissue and
of two control livers of non-liver-diseased cows ageing five and six years were
collected, fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin and routinely processed
for light microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Staining with haematoxylin and
eosin, Gomori&#x2019;s blue trichrome (Artisan&#x2122;, Dako) and
reticulin-nuclear fast red stains (Foot, Artisan&#x2122;, Dako), histochemical
detection of bilirubin (according to Hall), copper (rhodamine method for copper)
and ferric iron pigments (Iron stain, Artisan&#x2122;, Dako) and
immunohistochemical detection of &#x3B1;-smooth muscle actin (monoclonal mouse
anti-human alpha muscle actin, clone 1A4, Dako) and desmin (monoclonal mouse
anti-human desmin, clone D33, Dako) were carried out at the Institute of
Veterinary Pathology, University of Zurich using standard protocols. Cytokeratin
(mouse anti-human cytokeratin, MNF1166, Dako) and von Willebrand factor
immunohistochemistry (polyclonal rabbit anti-human von Willebrand factor, Dako)
were done to distinguish vessels from bile ducts. The size of 20 liver lobules
from this cow as well as from two healthy controls, aged five and six years, was
measured histomorphometrically using AxioVison software (Release 4.63, Zeiss),
means and standard deviations were calculated, and differences analysed using an
unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test (Statview 5.0 for Windows).</p>

        <title>Clinical findings during the first hospitalisation</title>
        <p>Auscultation on the left revealed no ruminal contractions and showed that the
content of the digestive tract exhibited no layered arrangement at this site.
Faeces had normal consistency and colour.</p>
        <p>Ultrasonographic examination revealed that the heart had a normal size and shape
and the large vessels were positioned normally within the thoracic cavity (cavum
thoracis). The rumen was large and gas-filled and only a few loops of the small
intestine (intestinum tenue) could be seen on the right side of the abdominal
cavity. There were three reticular contractions during a two-minute period. The
liver was visible ventrally on the left side of the abdominal cavity and the
gall bladder (vesica fellea) was moderately enlarged.</p>
        <p>Exploratory laparotomy revealed a heterotaxy of abdominal organs. The rumen was
almost empty and situated on the right side of the abdominal cavity. The
reticulum was attached to the rumen cranioventrally and contained sand. The
omasum was to the left of the rumen and had a firm consistency. The abomasum had
a normal size, was on the left side and displaced dorsally. It contained a small
amount of firm and doughy ingesta. The intestines were to the left of the rumen,
almost empty and had good peristalsis. The distal half and the tip of the caecum
(apex caeci) had a normal size and shape. The greater omentum, which normally
forms the supraomental recess (recessus supraomentalis) containing the
intestines in ruminants, was not detected during surgery (see post-mortem
findings). The abomasum was repositioned ventrally in the abdomen before closure
of the abdominal wall.</p>
        <p>Serum biochemistry analysis on the day of initial hospitalisation showed a
slightly increased bilirubin concentration as well as increased activities of
glutamate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinase. The
activity of sorbitol dehydrogenase was moderately increased and the activity of
gamma-glutamyltransferase was severely elevated. The cow also had a hypokalaemic
and hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis. The chloride concentration of the
ruminal fluid was normal (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). </p>

          <p>There were no macroscopic signs of acute or chronic inflammation of the
mucosa of the nasal cavity, frontal sinus, larynx and trachea. Both lungs
were of normal size and had only two anomalies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>): the apex of the cranial part of the cranial lobe of the
right lung (pars cranialis lobus cranialis pulmonis dextri) was bent
dorsally resulting in a V-shaped appearance. The accessory lobe (lobus
accessorius pulmonis dextri) was small. Light and transmission electron
microscopy revealed normal tracheal and nasal ciliary morphology and
ultrastructure. The number of cilia-bearing cells varied among different
specimens and within single specimens. Scanning electron microscopy showed a
few epithelial cells with long and thick apical protrusions representing
clotted cilia. Adjacent to these cells were epithelial cells that had intact
cilia and some that had microvilli. </p>

          <title>Digestive system</title>
          <p>The anatomy and topography of the digestive tract from the oral cavity to the
diaphragm was normal. Within the abdominal cavity there were striking
deviations relating to the shape and position of the digestive organs. The
reticulum and rumen occupied the right abdomen (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The reticulum was cranial and to
the left of the rumen. The reticular groove (sulcus reticuli) was 31 cm
long. The reticular mucosa was normal with characteristic polygonal cells.
The rumen had a normal mucosa but lacked pillars (pila ruminis) and hence
lacked compartmentalisation. However three low transverse folds were noted
on the interior of the floor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These folds,
from cranial to caudal, were 39, 64 and 69 cm long and the distances between
them were 36 and 16 cm respectively. Cranially, the rumen was attached to
the dorsal wall of the abdominal cavity.</p>

          <p>Two spleens lay on and were attached to the rumen craniodorsally and to the
dorsal abdominal wall. The larger spleen measured 26.5 &#xD7; 12.0 cm and
was on the left and the small right one measured 20.5 &#xD7; 5.5 cm (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The cranioventral wall of the rumen was
connected to the abomasum by a short peritoneal fold of the greater omentum.
The omasum was cranioventrally and to the left of the rumen and caudal to
the liver (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The abomasum was on the
abdominal floor in a bent position ventral to the omasum and the rumen
(Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). It was
loosely attached to the liver by mesogastrium, which originated from the
lesser curvature (curvatura minor) of the abomasum and represented the
lesser omentum (omentum minus). The abomasal greater curvature (curvatura
major) was orientated caudally (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and was connected loosely to the cranioventral aspect
of the rumen and the dorsal abdominal wall by the greater omentum (omentum
majus). Thus the ventral part of the rumen was not enclosed by the greater
omentum, which normally forms the omental bursa (bursa omentalis) and is
attached to the abomasum (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p>

          <p>The duodenum had an initial straight part arising from the pylorus and

cranial side of the abdominal cavity (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The jejunum was in the left ventral quadrant
of the abdominal cavity and formed many short coils. The mesojejunum was not
fused with the mesocolon ascendens (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The ileum arose from the jejunum in the left
caudoventral abdominal cavity and ran cranially to join the large intestine
at the ileal opening (ostium ileale) just cranial to the caecocolic opening
(ostium caecocolicum) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). </p>

          <p>The caecum was located on the left side near the median plane at
mid-abdominal level with its tip extending caudally (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The ascending colon could be divided into proximal,
spiral and distal loops (ansa proximalis, spiralis, and distalis coli)
(Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The proximal loop was S-shaped and continued cranially on
the right as spiral loop, which was situated near the median plane. The
mesojejunum was not fused with the part of the mesocolon ascendens that
fixes the spiral loop. The normally flattened, discoid and sagittally
extending spiral loop was folded such that the cranial and caudal rims of
the disc were fused, which resulted in a characteristic bi-layered
intestinal complex (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The caudal margin of the spiral loop was thus adjacent and
fixed to its cranial margin resulting in a semicircular structure. The
distal loop was U-shaped, started with a cranially running section, had an
ascending cranial loop and led to the transverse colon (colon transversum)
dorsocaudally (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).
There were two fibrosed strictures associated with the large intestine. One
involved the caecum and the other involved the beginning of the proximal
loop of the ascendic colon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The transverse
colon crossed the midline from the left to right caudal to the cranial
mesenteric artery (arteria mesenterica cranialis). The descending colon
(colon descendens) originated on the right side, but the anatomy and
position of the remainder of the descending colon as well as the rectum were
normal.</p>

          <p>The liver had transversally orientated dorsal (margo dorsalis) and ventral
borders (margo ventralis), a ventromedian position immediately caudal to the
diaphragm (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>) and was composed of two

was larger than the left lobe (lobus sinister). The very small lobe was
located infraportally between the larger two lobes, cranial and right to the
round ligament (ligamentum teres hepatis), right to the fissure of the round
ligament (fissura ligamentum teretis) and the falciform ligament (ligamentum
falciforme hepatis) and left and cranial to the gallbladder (vesica fellea)
and the cystic duct (ductus cysticus). This small and cylindric lobe had a
triangular basis on the visceral side, extended to the ventral border (margo

triangular rounded and dome-like shape (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>,

Figure S3), which joined to form a very short (7.0 cm) portal vein (vena
portae) with a large diameter (3.5 cm), which was subcapsular and nearly
completely intrahepatic (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>, see Additional
file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Figure S3 and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Figure S4). Two large branches were dispatched
(right 15 mm, left 7 mm) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>, see Additional
file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Figure S4) which supplied their respective
lobes. Many small branches (2 to 4 mm in diameter) arose from the two large
hepatic branches, as well as, from the portal vein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>, see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Figure S4).
The round ligament, the falciform ligament, the gallbladder and the cystic
duct were in close proximity. The gallbladder was slightly enlarged (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>, see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1). Left and right hepatic veins (vena hepatica
sinstra and dextra), joined to form the caudal vena cava. A large
anastomosis was present near the ventral border of the liver (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). The caudal vena cava - arising solely from the two
major hepatic veins in this animal - passed through the diaphragm via the
caval foramen (foramen venae cavae) and joined the right atrium of the heart
(Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>). </p>

(venae centrales) compared with only one in control livers. The width of the
hepatic lobules (radius&#x2009;=&#x2009;461&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;150 &#x3BC;m)
was significantly (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) reduced compared with two

Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>: Figure S6) had two to six
arterioles, one thin-walled venule and one or several lymphatic vessels,
which were sometimes mildly dilated. Moderate periportal fibrosis,
consisting of coarse collagen fibres and proliferating fibroblasts (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13</xref>, see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>: Figure S6), and moderate hyperplasia of small biliary
ductules (ductuli biliferi) were also prominent features (see Additional
file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>: Figure S6). There were relatively few
inflammatory cells (mainly lymphocytes and plasma cells), which was similar
to the control livers. The number of biliary ductules was increased but the
ductual lumina were normal (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>:

intralobularly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13</xref>, see Additional files

          <p>The anatomical features and position of the heart were normal. The abdominal
cavity demonstrated one striking abnormality of the venous drainage of the
trunk, pelvic limbs, kidneys, and pelvic organs. This large venous trunk
(caudal vena cava) did not descend to the dorsal margin of the liver, drain
the liver, pass through the diaphragm and end in the right atrium of the
heart. Instead it connected with the right azygous vein as it passed between
the crura of the diaphragm, below the vertebral column (columna vertebralis)
on the right surface of the descending aorta (aorta descendens). This
enlarged right azygous vein drained into the right atrium of the heart
(Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>, see
Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S11">11</xref>: Figure S11).</p>
          <p>Both ruminal arteries (Aa. ruminales dextrae et sinistrae) run along the
craniodorsal wall of the rumen to the right and left side of this organ and
proceeded caudally giving rise to dorsal and ventral branches (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In ruminants, the most common manifestation of heterotaxy of internal organs appears
to be situs ambiguus, which is divided into two primary subtypes: Asplenia syndrome
or right isomerism, and Polysplenia syndrome or left isomerism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Situs inversus, however, describes a situation in which all visceral
organs are reversed or mirrored from their normal position (referred to as situs
solitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]) and is considered extremely rare in ruminants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. To our knowledge, there have been three cases of asplenia, six cases of
hypoplastic spleens, 15 cases of two spleens and only two cases of situs inversus
described in cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The main findings in our patient (continuation of the caudal vena cava
into the right azygos vein, polysplenia, continuation of a common hepatic vein into
the right atrium, heterotaxia of the digestive tract, tri-lobed liver,
retroperitoneal position of both kidneys, positioning of the left kidney cranial to
the right kidney and normal anatomy and topography of heart and lungs) were in
general agreement with other reports of polysplenia syndrome in cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] und thus strongly indicate the presence of this syndrome in our cow.
Characteristics of the polysplenia syndrome in cattle - as reported in literature
and detected in this animal - are: continuation of the vena cava caudalis into the
vena azygos dextra (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;6; number of cases) or sinistra
(n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3), continuation of a common hepatic vein into the atrium dextrum
(n&#x2009;=&#x2009;4), situs inversus (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2) and left isomerism
(n&#x2009;=&#x2009;4) of the liver, situs inversus of the stomach (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2),
retroperitoneal position of both kidneys (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1), positioning of the
left kidney cranial to the right kidney (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1) and normal anatomy and
topography of the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>Primary ciliary dyskinesia has been associated with chronic airway diseases and
impaired fertility in dogs, horses, and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It is an unlikely cause of heterotaxy in cattle because in the patient
described in this report, there was no chronic respiratory disease and the
ultrastructure of the cilia was normal. Although fertility was severely reduced in
this cow, this does not support an etiological role of PCD since the cow was
inseminated late because of small size and did therefore produce a calf at 39 months
of age. Because genetic and functional analyses were not carried out, PCD cannot be
ruled out in this case.</p>
      <p>In humans, neonates with polysplenia syndrome have a high incidence of severe heart
disease and therefore high juvenile mortality. Only children without severe
cardiovascular defects and those in which cardiovascular defects are corrected
immediately after birth survive and reach adulthood. Therefore, in adults,
polysplenia syndrome is clinically characterised by gastrointestinal heterotaxia and
non-life-threatening vascular abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], which is similar to findings in our patient and in accordance with
reports in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Further investigations in neonate calves are needed to determine whether
similar cardiovascular defects occur in cattle with polysplenia or asplenia
syndrome; unfortunately most calves that die shortly after birth because of
postnatal asphyxia or cyanosis are not necropsied.</p>
      <p>Many of the topographical abnormalities observed in the present case can be explained
by specific developmental stages of organs during embryogenesis. The topography of
the liver in our patient was characteristic for the position of this organ in the
perinatal period in cattle, indicating that the ruminant-specific shift to the right
side and anti-clockwise quarter-turn of the organ during the postnatal life had not
occurred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The caudal vena cava is usually composed of a sequence of several
sagittal embryonic vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The lack of connection or a faulty connection between the intra-hepatic
or immediate post-hepatic parts of these sagittal veins results in a dorsal
anastomosis between the right or left azygous vein and the abdominal segment of the
caudal vena cava. The latter vein therefore does not descend to the dorsal margin of
the liver. This modification of vasculogenesis leads to a continuation of the caudal
vena cava into the right azygous vein, which occurred in our patient and also in
several other cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The only function of the final segment of the caudal vena cava, which
ran from the liver and passed through the diaphragm to join the right atrium of the
heart, was drainage of the liver. From a functional point of view, it served as a
common hepatic vein.</p>
      <p>The asymmetrical morphology of the tri-lobed liver was reflected by the specific
drainage of the two large lobes by two large hepatic veins, one on the right and one
on the left. This finding was also in agreement with the very small size of a liver
lobe that possibly represent the quadrate lobe and the complete absence of the
caudate lobe (lobus caudatus), which are normally drained by the large middle
hepatic vein (vena hepatica media) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The specific anatomy of the liver and its midline position in the
abdominal cavity support the concept of a polysplenia syndrome/left isomerism in
this animal.</p>
      <p>The histological characteristics of the hepatic lobules were indicative of abnormal
haemodynamics. However, different types of haemodynamic changes may cause identical
stereotypical abnormalities in the portal triad (pattern of portal vein
hypoperfusion) similar to those described in our patient. Causes of portal vein
hypoperfusion include congenital portosystemic shunts, arterioportal fistulas and
obstruction or hypoplasia of the portal vein. The macroscopic and histological
changes in the vasculature of our patient represented primary pre- and intra-hepatic
hypoplasia of the portal vein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The changes in liver microstructure may also have reflected or caused
the poor nutritional status of this cow. Normal liver function is a prerequisite for
many catabolic and anabolic processes, and abnormalities in serum enzyme activities
and bilirubin concentration in this cow were characteristic of chronic impairment of
liver function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. There have been no previous reports of the histological changes in the
liver of ruminants with situs ambiguus.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>In the present case report, there were striking abnormalities in the anatomy,
topography, fixation and thus mobility of the abdominal parts of the digestive
tract, which resulted in obvious digestive malfunction, small body seize, poor body
condition and low milk production of the cow.</p>
      <p>These findings seen in our patient may have been caused by a number of factors
including the loose connection of the abomasum to the cranially situated abdominal
organs and wall and thus rendering susceptibility to dislocation and bloating,
constrictions of the large intestine at the level of the caecum and the proximal
loop of the ascending colon, and lack of normal ruminal compartmentalisation. The
laboratory findings suggested reduced feed intake caused by mild abomasal reflux
syndrome and/or prolonged periods of recumbency. Whether liver abnormalities
contributed to poor body condition is not clear. However, marked fibrosis of the
liver reflected poor nutritional status and possibly chronically impaired
metabolism. The absence of inflammation and cholestasis and the presence of
arteriolar proliferation, hypoplastic venules, portal fibrosis and bile duct
proliferation were indicative of abnormal haemodynamics.</p>
      <p>It was surprising that the cow was able to produce a live calf, given that fertility
was obviously impaired. Equally surprising was that the cow had ruminal contractions
and was seen by the owner to ruminate given the ruminal anomalies observed. The
normal consistency of the faeces was an indication of a certain level of normalcy of
digestive tract function.</p>
