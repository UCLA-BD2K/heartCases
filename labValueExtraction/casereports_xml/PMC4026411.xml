      <abstract>
        <p>Mutations of the Cell Division Cycle 73 (<italic>CDC73)</italic> tumor suppressor gene (previously known as <italic>HRPT2),</italic> encoding for parafibromin, are associated with the Hyperparathyroidism-Jaw Tumor (HPT-JT) syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease whose clinical manifestations are mainly parathyroid tumors and, less frequently, ossifying fibromas of the jaws, uterine and renal tumors. Most mutations of <italic>CDC73</italic> are nonsense or frameshift, while missense mutations are rare and generally affect the N-terminal domain of parafibromin, a region that is still poorly characterized. The aim of this study was to characterize a novel somatic <italic>CDC73</italic> missense mutation (Ile60Asn) identified in the mandibular tumor of a HPT-JT patient carrying a germline <italic>CDC73</italic> inactivating mutation. Immunostaining of the tumor showed reduced nuclear parafibromin immunoreactivity. Western blotting and confocal microscopy of transfected cells demonstrated that the Ile60Asn mutant parafibromin was less expressed than the wild-type protein and exhibited impaired nucleolar localization. Treatment of transfected cells with translation and proteasome inhibitors demonstrated a decreased stability of the Ile60An mutant, partially due to an increase in proteasomal degradation. Overexpression of the Ile60Asn mutant led to increased cell proliferation and to accumulation in the G2/M phase of cell cycle. Moreover, mutant parafibromin lost the ability to down-regulate c-myc expression. In conclusion, our study shows that a missense mutation in the N-terminus of parafibromin, identified in an ossifying fibroma from a HPT-JT patient, stimulated cell proliferation and impaired parafibromin expression and nucleolar localization, suggesting a relevant role of the N-terminal domain for parafibromin function.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Hyperparathyroidism-Jaw Tumor (HPT-JT) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease whose first clinical manifestation is usually the occurrence of parathyroid tumors, that are malignant in 15% of cases; in addition, 25&#x2013;50% of patients may develop ossifying fibromas of the jaws and benign or malignant renal and uterine tumors <xref rid="pone.0097994-Newey1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The ossifying fibromas of mandible and maxilla occurring in HPT-JT patients are histologically distinct from the osteoclastic &#x2018;brown tumors&#x2019; typical of primary hyperparathyroidism, and may occur at very early age <xref rid="pone.0097994-Newey1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mutations of the Cell Division Cycle 73 (<italic>CDC73</italic>) gene, previously known as <italic>HRPT2</italic>, have been identified in &gt;80% of the reported HPT-JT families <xref rid="pone.0097994-Newey2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. <italic>CDC73</italic> encodes for parafibromin, a 531 amino acids protein that acts in the context of the RNA polymerase II associated factor 1 (PAF1) transcriptional regulatory complex <xref rid="pone.0097994-Carpten1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The human PAF1 complex associates with RNA polymerase II throughout the entire coding region of transcriptionally active genes, indicating roles in initiation, elongation and post-transcriptional events <xref rid="pone.0097994-Newey2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Parafibromin has many different functions: among the most relevant for its tumor suppressor activity, there are repression of cyclin D1 <xref rid="pone.0097994-Woodard1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0097994-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and inhibition of the c-myc proto-oncogene <xref rid="pone.0097994-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Parafibromin has also been reported to activate the Wnt signaling through interaction with &#x3B2;-catenin <xref rid="pone.0097994-Mosimann1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> in its dephosphorylated form <xref rid="pone.0097994-Takahashi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Despite most of the identified <italic>CDC73</italic> mutations reported to date are frameshift or nonsense <xref rid="pone.0097994-Newey1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, large or whole-gene deletions have also been described <xref rid="pone.0097994-Cascn1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0097994-Bricaire1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Missense mutations are rare and generally affect residues located in the still poorly characterized N-terminus of parafibromin. Crystallographic determination of the structure of the C-terminal domain of the yeast homologue of parafibromin, Cdc73, revealed a fold highly similar to that of the small GTPase Ras <xref rid="pone.0097994-Amrich1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0097994-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Unfortunately, no structural data on the N-terminal domain of the protein are available to date. Moreover, parafibromin interaction domains with known proteins have been identified in the C-terminal domain in amino acids between 200 and 413, but not in the N-terminal domain <xref rid="pone.0097994-Newey1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the present study we characterized a somatic missense mutation (<italic>i.e.</italic>, Ile60Asn) located in the N-terminal domain of <italic>CDC73,</italic> identified in a mandibular ossifying fibroma that occurred in a HPT-JT patient. This mutation led to decreased parafibromin expression, impaired its nucleolar localization, and determined an increase in cell proliferation, thus suggesting a relevant role of the N-terminal domain for parafibromin function.</p>

        <p>Patient&#x2019;s past medical history was characterized by the occurrence of two parathyroid adenomas and of multiple endometrial hyperplastic polyps. At the age of 28 years, the patient received a diagnosis of HPT-JT because of the occurrence of a 3-cm ossifying fibroma in the left mandible, confirmed by histopathological examination of the resected tumor.</p>

        <p>DNA purification from tissue specimen and mutation analysis of the <italic>CDC73</italic> gene were performed as previously reported <xref rid="pone.0097994-Schwarz1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The MutationTaster tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mutationtaster.org">www.mutationtaster.org</ext-link>) was consulted to predict <italic>in silico</italic> the pathogenicity of the Ile60Asn mutation. Briefly, MutationTaster <xref rid="pone.0097994-Schwarz1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> is a free application for the evaluation of the disease-causing potential of a DNA sequence alteration. This prediction tool analyzes evolutionary conservation, splice-site changes, loss of protein features and changes that affect mRNA amount. Test results are evaluated by a Bayes classifier, which predicts the disease potential, choosing among three prediction models (<italic>i.e.</italic> synonimous alteration, single amino acid alteration, alteration causing a complex change in the amino acid sequence).</p>

        <title>A Novel Somatic Missense Mutation in the <italic>CDC73</italic> Gene</title>
        <p>Sequencing of the whole <italic>CDC73</italic> gene in the jaw tumor demonstrated the presence of a heterozygous T&gt;A transversion at position 179 (c.179 T&gt;A) in exon 2, leading to an Ile60Asn substitution. This mutation was demonstrated to be somatic due to its absence in peripheral blood DNA. The presence of the known germline frameshift c.(136_144)del5 mutation in exon 2 was confirmed in the tumor specimen. Subcloning of <italic>CDC73</italic> exon 2 amplicon from tumor DNA into a plasmid vector and sequencing of different clones demonstrated that the c.(136_144)del5 and c.179 T&gt;A mutations were on different alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097994-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

A conservation analysis through alignment of human parafibromin with the amino acid sequence homologues of ten other species demonstrated that the isoleucine at position 60 was highly conserved, with <italic>F. rubripes</italic> as the evolutionary lowest species where the amino acid is present. Moreover, in <italic>C.elegans</italic> and <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>, the residue at position 60 is a leucine, thus retaining the hydrophobic properties of isoleucine.</p>

      <p>This study demonstrated, in an ossifying fibroma of the jaw arising in a HPT-JT patient, the presence of a somatic <italic>CDC73</italic> mutation that probably represented the &#x201C;second hit&#x201D; in tumor development, since it led to decreased parafibromin expression and loss of its nucleolar localization.</p>
      <p>The mutation, <italic>i.e.</italic> Ile60Asn, which has not been described so far, affected a conserved amino acid in the N-terminal portion of parafibromin. The N-terminal domain is probably crucial for parafibromin activity and has been involved by most missense mutations of the <italic>CDC73</italic> gene <xref rid="pone.0097994-Newey1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097994-Bricaire1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Among the reported missense mutations in the N-terminal domain of parafibromin, Leu64Pro impairs parafibromin anti-proliferative activity and ability to repress cyclin D1 expression <xref rid="pone.0097994-Woodard1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>; Leu95Pro abolishes nucleolar localization and provides dominant interfering properties to parafibromin <xref rid="pone.0097994-Panicker1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>; Arg77Pro causes cytoplasm retention, decreased half-life and cell overgrowth, even in the presence of endogenous parafibromin <xref rid="pone.0097994-Pazienza1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. To the best of our knowledge, no other <italic>CDC73</italic> missense substitutions have been characterized so far.</p>
      <p>The Ile60Asn mutation identified in this study had a high probability to be pathogenic, considering the high degree of conservation of the isoleucine at position 60. This mutation did not lead to a complete loss of parafibromin expression, as demonstrated by the retention of a faint but diffuse nuclear immunostaining in the ossifying fibroma. Experiments in cells transfected with wild-type and Ile60Asn mutant parafibromin demonstrated that the mutation determined a decreased stability of the protein, that may only partially be explained by an accelerated proteasomal degradation. Since proteasomal inhibition did not completely retrieve mutant parafibromin level, there are probably alternative mechanisms by which Ile60Asn parafibromin is degraded.</p>
      <p>The subnuclear localization of Ile60Asn mutant and wild-type parafibromin was also evaluated, since there are evidences that parafibromin nucleolar accumulation has a key role for its tumor suppressor activity independently from nuclear distribution, as indicated by its loss in a subset of sporadic parathyroid carcinomas with <italic>CDC73</italic> mutations <xref rid="pone.0097994-Juhlin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. As demonstrated by confocal microscopy, the Ile60Asn mutant retained the nuclear expression, but showed a decrease in nucleolar accumulation.</p>
      <p>The nucleolar distribution of parafibromin has been related to three nucleolar localization signals (NoLS) acting together, encompassing amino acids 76&#x2013;92, 192&#x2013;194, and 393&#x2013;409 <xref rid="pone.0097994-Hahn1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Although the Ile60Asn mutation is located 16 residues upstream the first NoLS, it caused loss of nucleolar localization.</p>
      <p>Intriguingly, the Leu95Pro mutation, located outside the NoLS, has been reported to similarly impair nucleolar accumulation <xref rid="pone.0097994-Panicker1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. It is therefore conceivable that both Ile60Asn and Leu95Pro substitutions determine a change in the three-dimensional structure of parafibromin that impairs a combined action of the three NoLS.</p>
      <p>The effect of parafibromin on cell apoptosis is controversial, since both pro-apoptotic <xref rid="pone.0097994-Lin2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and anti-apoptotic <xref rid="pone.0097994-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> roles have been proposed. In our study, over-expression of both wild-type and mutant parafibromin had no effect on cell apoptosis, suggesting that the protein has probably no relevant pro- or anti-apoptotic activity in the cellular systems used.</p>
      <p>The effect of wild-type and mutant parafibromin on cell cycle and cell proliferation was also assessed and, as expected for a tumor suppressor gene, an antiproliferative activity of wild-type parafibromin was demonstrated. Importantly, this activity was not retained by the Ile60Asn mutant, which stimulated cell proliferation, thus confirming previous findings about a dominant-interfering activity of other parafibromin mutants <xref rid="pone.0097994-Panicker1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0097994-Pazienza1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In addition, Ile60Asn mutant parafibromin lost the ability to down-regulate c-myc expression. These effects on cell proliferation and c-myc expression were probably the consequence of the low expression level and of the loss of nucleolar localization, that might be required to fully elicit parafibromin transcriptional functions. Since an intra-nuclear movement of yeast Cdc73 from the nucleoplasm toward the nucleolus has been observed in presence of mutant paf1 and rtf, both components of the Paf1 complex <xref rid="pone.0097994-Porter1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, we can speculate that the change in intra-nuclear parafibromin localization might in turn be due to a loss of interactions involving the N-terminal domain of parafibromin and unknown nucleolar partners.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrated that a novel missense mutation in the N-terminus of parafibromin stimulated cell proliferation and impaired parafibromin expression and nucleolar localization, contributing to the characterization of the N-terminal domain that is to date largely unknown and has probably a relevant role for parafibromin tumor suppressor function.</p>
