      <abstract>
        <p>We report the case of a 55&#x2013;year&#x2013;old man, 
hypertensive, who presented to the Emergency Room with intense 
occipital cephaleea, nausea, vomiting and disturbance of balance. 
The peculiarity of this case was given by the simultaneous presence of 
two brain hemorrhagic lesions and an unusual hypodensity with 
digitiform borders at cerebral CT scan, which suggested a 
different  etiology than hypertension and leaded us to 
further investigations, which confirmed the diagnosis of lung cancer 
with multiple brain metastases.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>The most common cause of intracerebral hemorrhage in middle 
aged patients is chronic uncontrolled hypertension. Other causes 
are rupture of an aneurysm or an arteriovenous malformation, 
arteriopathy, anticoagulant therapy, cerebral venous 
thrombosis, hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic infarct, 
trauma, sympathomimetic drug use and brain tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). 
Brain metastases are the most frequent cerebral tumors in adults, lung cancer being 
the leading primary source. About 80% of the metastases are 
located in the cerebral hemispheres and 20% in the posterior 
fossa structures. Twenty five percent of the brain metastases have 
an intratumoral hemorrhage as the cause of first clinical signs 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>Intracerebral hemorrhage can occur in any part of the brain. 
The bleeding might be located to one hemisphere (lobar 
intracerebral hemorrhage) or to other brain structures. Predilection 
sites for intracerebral hemorrhage due to hypertension include: 
basal ganglia (40&#x2013;50%), thalamus (10&#x2013;15%), 
pons (5&#x2013;12%) and cerebellum (5&#x2013;10%). 
Chronic hypertension generates a small vessel vasculopathy, in 
time, characterized by lipohyalinosis, fibrinoid necrosis and 
development of Charcot&#x2013;Bouchard aneurysms affecting and 
penetrating arteries throughout the brain 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>].</p>

      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>We report here the case of a 55&#x2013;year&#x2013;old male, 
patient, smoker (20 cigarettes/day for 30 years), hypertensive 
(highest values of 210/120 mmHg, diagnosed with hypertension at the age 
of 46), with intermittent use of antihypertensive treatment at home, 
who presented at the hospital with abrupt onset of intense 
occipital headache, nausea, vomiting and disturbance of balance. 
The physical examination revealed a conscious and cooperative patient 
with a high value of arterial blood pressure (175/80mmHg), a cardiac 
sinus rhythm of 84/min, astasia&#x2013;abasia, left superior limb 
ataxia, positive bilateral Babinski sign. He had no other personal 
medical history but a family history of cerebrovascular diseases and 
cancer (two uncles: one who died after an intracerebral hemorrhage and 
the other one due to brain metastasis from primary urinary bladder 
tumor). The complete blood cell count was normal, the biochemical 
blood tests revealed high glucose levels (213mg/dL), slight increase 
of transaminases (GOT= 45 U/L, GPT= 58U/L), dyslipidemia 
with hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia 
(cholesterol=275mg/dL, triglyceride= 170mg/dL), increased 
fibrinogen (463mg/dL) and high sedimentation rate (33mm/h), spontaneous 
INR of 1.24 and PT =13.6/s.</p>
      <p>The CT cerebral scan performed at the admission revealed a 
left cerebellar hemorrhage (3.7/2.7cm) with perilesional edema 
with compressive effect on the fourth ventricle and minimal efraction 
at this site, but no appreciable underlying mass and a small hemorrhage 
of 9mm localized in the right temporal lobe with minimal perilesional 
edema without ventricular efraction 
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>). A left occipital 
hypodense brain area with digitiform borders was also found 
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>, white arrow). Due to 
these initial unusual findings, the next step was to perform a brain 
CT with contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>), 
which revealed multiple zones with post&#x2013;contrast 
enhancement localized in both cerebellar hemispheres (of 17/16 mm in 
the right cerebellar hemisphere and of 24/25mm in the left 
cerebellar hemisphere), in the right temporal lobe (9mm), in the 
right occipital lobe (7mm) and in the left occipital lobe (1cm) 
with surrounding edema, one of them associated with an acute hemorrhage 
(a left cerebellar hematoma). The aspect of the lesions was suggestive 
for cerebral metastases. This finding led us to standard 
further investigations appropriate in such a clinical situation. A 
chest X&#x2013;ray was performed and revealed multiple opacities 
with irregular borders and the patient was eventually diagnosed with 
lung cancer after bronchoscopy. The patient received depletive 
(Manitol), corticoid (Dexamethasone), antihypertensive and pain 
therapy until being evaluated by the oncology service.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Although the patient had multiple vascular risk factors 
(hypertension improperly treated, dyslipidemia, and smoking) and, at 
his age, the risk for cerebral bleeding as a complication of the 
vascular disease was high, a careful examination of the brain CT 
scan suggested that the hemorrhage was due to a less probable cause, 
namely multiple brain metastases of lung cancer origin. Moreover, from 
the clinical point of view, there was a discrepancy between the 
massive lesions revealed by the CT scan and the minor clinical signs, 
which made the pure vascular character of the disease improbable.
In contrast to the cerebrovascular disease, space occupying lesions 
which develop over a long time do not generate dramatic 
neurological symptoms. However, multiple simultaneous 
intracerebral hemorrhages (SIHs) occur rarely, in a series of 
hemorrhagic strokes only 2.8% of patients being diagnosed with 
SIHs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. In different studies, 
SIHs were associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, 
vasculitis, hematologic disorders, illicit drug use, anticoagulant 
therapy, or with hemorrhagic transformation of multiple cerebral infarcts 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. The case presented in this 
report illustrates the caution needed for the correct diagnosis of SIHs.
