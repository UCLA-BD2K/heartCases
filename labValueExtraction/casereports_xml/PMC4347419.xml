      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The present study reports the case of a male patient referred to orthodontic treatment
at the age of 11 years and 8 months old. His chief complaint was being "too toothy". The
patient had a nasal breathing pattern, with history of allergy, onychophagia and
adenoidectomy at the age of four. He also had good oral hygiene and was monitored by a
pediatric dentist every 6 months. He reported having suffered dental trauma at the age
of eight, which resulted in minor fracture on the incisal edge of the left maxillary
central incisor. </p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>DIAGNOSIS</title>
      <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>, facial analysis revealed a
convex profile, with a well-defined mentolabial sulcus and everted lower lip (Ul S-line:
1 mm; Ll S-line: 2 mm). Labial seal was strained and, at rest, maxillary incisors were
prominent. At smiling, the patient had a wide buccal corridor despite satisfactory smile
arc. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">2</xref>, the patient was in mixed dentition, with Class II
molar relationship and maxillary incisors bucally tipped, which features Angle Class II,
division 1 malocclusion.</p>

</p>
      <p>He had narrow maxillary arch with high palate; and mandibular arch with accentuated
curve of Spee. Maxillary and mandibular midlines were coincident with each other and
with the facial midline; severe overbite and overjet were evinced in 10 mm.</p>
      <p>Periapical and panoramic radiographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figs 3</xref> and
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">4</xref>) revealed the presence of all permanent
teeth, including third molars; in addition to normal tooth as well as bone structures.
Cephalometric examination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Tab 1</xref>) revealed that the patient had Class II
skeletal pattern (ANB = 6<sup>o)</sup>, protrusion of the maxilla (SNA = 84<sup>o)</sup>
and retrusion of the mandible (SNB = 78<sup>o)</sup> in relation to the base of the
skull. He had decreased mandibular plane with a tendency towards horizontal growth
(SN-GoGn = 23<sup>o</sup> and FMA = 17<sup>o)</sup>. Maxillary incisors were severely
buccally tipped and protruded (1-NA = 30<sup>o</sup> and 8 mm), while mandibular
incisors were well positioned (1-NB = 27<sup>o</sup> and 5 mm).</p>

      <title>TREATMENT PLAN</title>
      <p>Before occlusal treatment planning was developed, the patient was referred to an ear,
nose and throat specialist for previous evaluation. Despite history of adenoidectomy,
patient's lateral cephalogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig 5</xref>) revealed
adenoid tissue on posterior pharyngeal wall. Thus, there was an urgent need to
investigate whether adenoid or other type of tissue was obstructing patient's upper
airways and, therefore, causing nasal breathing. Nevertheless, obstruction was absent;
thereby rendering nasal breathing an acquired habit associated with hindered labial seal
due to severe overjet. Should normal breathing not have been restored after incisor
retraction and achievement of potential passive labial seal, the patient would have been
referred to speech therapy. Likewise, he would have been referred to psychological
therapy to quit nail biting (onychophagia).</p>
      <p>With a view to correcting skeletal and dental disharmonies, initial treatment planning
consisted of using a Haas appliance to expand the maxilla in transverse direction.
Additionally, with a view to correcting skeletal and dental disharmonies in the sagittal
plane and to attain Class I molar relationship, treatment planning included the use of
Kloehn-type headgear (cervical pull). Thus, treatment would take advantage of patient's
favorable growth pattern. Subsequently, to correct severe overbite, an interocclusal
splint was installed. A preadjusted, fixed orthodontic Roth prescription appliance with
0.022 x 0.028-in slots was installed for alignment and leveling, incisors retraction and
treatment finishing. After the active phase of treatment, a wraparound removable
appliance, with anterior bite plate and mandibular intercanine bar, was prescribed.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>TREATMENT PROGRESS</title>
      <p>Treatment began by adapting the orthodontic rings used to manufacture the Haas
appliance. Subsequently, the appliance was installed and the patient advised to turn the
screw 1/4 of a turn every 12 hours during 15 days in order to enhance maxillary shape.
Once stability was attained, the expansion appliance remained in position for four
months, acting as a retainer. During this period, the Kloehn-type headgear (cervical
pull) was installed and used for 16 to 18 hours a day. After removing the expansion
appliance, an acrylic plate was installed with a view to aiding severe overbite
correction. The patient and his family were informed about the need for compliance,
particularly with regard to the headgear and the acrylic plate, necessary to achieve
treatment objectives.</p>
      <p>During the same phase of treatment, preadjusted brackets (Roth prescription, 0.022 x
0.028-in slots) were bonded to mandibular first molars and incisors for intrusion by
means of Ricketts<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> 0.017 x 0.025-in stainless
steel utility arch. After intrusion and with premolars, maxillary canines and second
molars erupted; maxillary and mandibular teeth were all bonded. Alignment and leveling
were attained by means of stainless steel 0.016, 0.018 and 0.020-in archwire with mild
step down bends at the region of mandibular incisors aimed at remaining intruded.
Importantly, since treatment onset, both maxillary and mandibular archwires were often
used in coordination. In the maxillary arch, retraction of incisors was carried out by
means of a stainless steel 0.019 x 0.026-in archwire with a bull loop placed between
lateral incisors and canines and used for space closure. After closing existing spaces,
the finishing phase was carried out in both arches with the use of stainless steel 0.018
x 0.025-in straight archwires of individual shape, torque and coordination.</p>
      <p>After confirming that all treatment objectives had been achieved, both maxillary and
mandibular fixed appliances were removed and the retention phase started. To this end, a
wraparound removable splint consisting of an stainless steel 0.032-in archwire and an
anterior bite plate was installed in the maxillary arch with a view to preventing
overbite relapse. As for the mandibular arch, a 0.032-in stainless steel wire
intercanine bar was installed. Importantly, the patient proved highly compliant during
the active phase of treatment as well as during the retention phase.</p>

      <title>RESULTS</title>
      <p>Patient's final records (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f07">Figs 7-12</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Tab 1</xref>) assessment revealed that treatment
objectives were achieved. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f07">Figure 7</xref> shows that
despite mild concave facial profile due to accentuated growth of the chin and nose,
there was significant improvement in the relationship established between upper and
lower lips, which resulted in passive lip sealing and, as a result, improved facial
esthetics. Smile was more harmonious with reduction in buccal corridor width, thereby
presenting satisfactory maxillary incisors exposure.</p>

</p>
      <p>Dental assessment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f07">Figs 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f08">8</xref>) revealed significant improvement in the shape of the maxillary
arch due to correction of maxillary atresia. Alignment and leveling were successfully
achieved. Class I molar and canine relationship was achieved on both sides. Overbite and
overjet were corrected.</p>
      <p>There was an increase in maxillary (from 51.5 mm to 58 mm) and mandibular intermolar
width (from 47.5 mm to 51 mm). Since permanent mandibular incisors had not yet erupted
at treatment onset, mandibular intercanine width could not be assessed. Nevertheless,
maxillary intercanine width increased from 33.5 mm to 38 mm. Treatment finishing
achieved balanced occlusion, with functional harmony in protrusive excursion as well as
right and left lateral excursion. Importantly, final results were achieved by means of
mild apical remodeling of maxillary incisors despite significant repositioning of these
teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f09">Fig 9</xref>). Moreover, as shown by final
panoramic radiograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig 10</xref>), good root
parallelism was attained in both maxillary and mandibular arches.</p>
      <p>As expected, several skeletal changes were achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f11">Fig
11</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Tab 1</xref>), with significant
improvements in sagittal relationship between maxilla and mandible (SNA =
81<sup>o</sup>, SNB = 80<sup>o</sup> and ANB = 1<sup>o)</sup>. The headgear appliance
allowed not only the direction of maxillary growth to change, but also the expression of
potential mandibular growth, even though orthopedic effects were produced by the
application of mild forces (300 g/side).<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> There
was remarkable reduction in facial convexity and, despite cervical pull, opening of the
mandibular plane angle did not occur (GoGn-SN and FMA remained practically unaltered).
Significant alteration was also found in the position of maxillary incisors (1-NA =
25<sup>o</sup> and 5 mm), which notably contributed to overjet correction and
improvement of interincisal angle (1 / 1 = 126<sup>o)</sup>.</p>
      <p>Total cephalometric superimposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f12">Fig 12</xref>)
revealed restricted anterior maxillary growth with downward displacement, only.
Nevertheless, there was mild anterior displacement of the mandible, as well, which was
responsible for patient's mild concave profile. This fact was greatly reinforced by
significant anterior growth of the chin. Overjet and overbite were corrected. Partial
maxillary superimposition revealed expressive lingual movement of incisors, with altered
tipping and posterior displacement of A Point. A large amount of vertical growth was
observed in the mandible, followed by compensatory alveolar growth in the region of
molars.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>FINAL CONSIDERATIONS</title>
      <p>Angle Class II malocclusion is occasionally associated with a narrow maxilla, which most
of times creates the need to start orthodontic treatment by correcting maxillary
transverse deficiency for subsequent correction of sagittal relationship.<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In the case reported herein, the patient was at a
fairly favorable age; for this reason, rapid maxillary expansion by means of Haas
appliance was the technique of choice.<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> After
maxillary expansion, an increase in maxillary arch width and spontaneous gain in the
mandibular arch were achieved - probably due to alterations in muscle balance between
the tongue and buccinator muscles (which affect the increase in mandibular arch width) -
with an increase of 3.5 mm in intermolar width.<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

      <p>Overbite correction was achieved by means of leveling the mandibular arch, which had
accentuated curve of Spee, by means of intrusion of mandibular incisors. In 1938,
Hemley<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> described treatment carried out by
means of anterior bite plate used to favor extrusion of posterior teeth, after which a
cervical headgear associated with bite plate was used, yielding satisfactory clinical
outcomes when treating Angle Class II malocclusion patients.</p>
      <p>As previously reported, even though an acrylic anterior bite plate was used in
association with cervical headgear (Kloehn),<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
patient's mandibular plane remained practically unaltered, probably due to the
prevalence of horizontal growth pattern. Combined with accentuated growth of the chin
and nose, this fact contributed to render patient's profile slightly concave.<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>

<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p>
      <p>Thus, reassessment of patient's final records confirms that treatment objectives were
successfully achieved with Class I molar and canine relationship.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Moreover, nasal breathing was reestablished, thereby eliminating
the need for speech therapy. It is worth noting that, despite patient's and his family's
opposition, maxillary and mandibular third molars were eventually extracted.</p>
