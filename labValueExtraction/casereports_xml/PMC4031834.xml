      <abstract>
        <p>Preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low-platelet
count), and acute fatty liver of pregnancy are the main causes of thrombotic
microangiopathy and severe liver dysfunction during pregnancy and represent different
manifestations of the same pathological continuum. The case of a 35-week pregnant
woman who was admitted to an intensive care unit immediately after a Cesarean section
due to fetal death and the presence of nausea, vomiting, and jaundice is reported.
Postpartum preeclampsia and acute fatty liver of pregnancy were diagnosed. The
patient developed an acute subdural hematoma and an intracerebral hemorrhage, which
were subjected to neurosurgical treatment. The patient died from refractory hemolytic
anemia and spontaneous bleeding of multiple organs. Preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, and
acute fatty liver of pregnancy might overlap and be associated with potentially fatal
complications, including intracranial hemorrhage, as in the present case. Early
detection and diagnosis are crucial to ensure appropriate management and treatment
success.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Pregnancy induces physiological, hormonal, and physical changes that may cause
hypertensive, hemorrhagic, hematological, and liver complications. Less than 1% of women
require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) during pregnancy and the peripartum
period, which is associated with increased maternal and fetal mortality.<sup>(<xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)</sup> Preeclampsia, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated
liver enzymes, and low-platelet count) syndrome, and acute fatty liver of pregnancy
(AFLP) are the main causes of thrombotic microangiopathy<sup>(<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</sup> and severe liver dysfunction during pregnancy and most
likely represent several manifestations of the same pathological continuum.<sup>(<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup>
</p>
      <p>The present article describes an uncommon case of acute subdural hematoma and
intracerebral hemorrhage occurring as fatal complications of severe thrombotic
microangiopathy during pregnancy.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>The patient was a black female, aged 36 years old, with a past history of an abortion
two years prior. As an asthmatic, she used inhaled bronchodilators and was admitted to
the hospital at a gestational age of 35 weeks due to nausea, vomiting, jaundice,
abdominal pain, and cessation of fetal movements starting two days prior; fetal death
was diagnosed. The patient's blood pressure was normal (maximum of 130/80 mmHg before
delivery), and she presented without fever but developed tachycardia during the first
hours of hospitalization. A cesarean section with general anesthesia was performed on
day two of hospitalization, and the patient was immediately transferred to the ICU.</p>
      <p>Upon admission to the ICU, crystalloid fluid resuscitation was performed, and the
patient's vital signs, level of consciousness, lochia, and surgical wound were closely
monitored. The laboratory tests (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>)
indicated anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 10.6 g/dL; fragmented red blood
cells; a platelet count of 232,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, leukocytosis with a left shift (total
white cell count, 24,800/mm<sup>3</sup>; and band cell count 2,728/mm<sup>3</sup>);
aspartate transaminase (AST), 150 U/L; alanine transaminase (ALT), 152 U/L; total
bilirubin, 6.31 mg/dL; direct bilirubin, 4.29 mg/dL; lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), 1,249
U/L; alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 314 U/L; kidney failure (creatinine, 2.88 mg/dL; urea,
94 mg/dL); increased partial thromboplastin time (51.5 seconds), normal initial
prothrombin time, negative D-dimer non-coagulant fibrinogen (more than ten times the
upper limit); significant proteinuria with a proteinuria/creatinuria ratio of 0.7; uric
acid, 7 mg/dL; pH 7.30; pCO<sub>2</sub>, 36 mmHg; HCO<sub>3</sub>, 18.3 mmol/L; Base
Excess, -7.4 mmol/L; and arterial plasma lactic acid, 3.7 mmol/L. The patient exhibited
frequent hypoglycemic episodes from day two to day six of hospitalization. Based on the
clinical and laboratory data at the time of ICU admission, the following diagnostic
possibilities were suggested: postpartum preeclampsia, AFLP, and/or HELLP syndrome.</p>

      <p>Intermittent peaks of systemic arterial hypertension started on day three, reached a
maximum of 178/86 mm Hg, and lasted 18 days. To assess the liver and kidneys, total
abdomen computed tomography (CT) was performed on day six, which revealed a hematoma at
the rectus abdominis muscle (mostly on its right side), the lower portion of which
measured approximately 4.5 cm (an usual finding after cesarean sections). No other
significant changes were found. The patient exhibited oligoanuria starting on day 10,
which was accompanied by signs of anasarca and necessitated hemodialysis. A large left
pleural effusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>) with transudate
characteristics developed on day 15 after delivery and was accompanied by acute
respiratory failure. Left chest drainage was performed, and mechanical ventilation was
initiated following intubation.</p>

abnormal findings on the neurological examination, a score of 15 on the Glasgow coma
scale, equal-size and light-reactive pupils, and no focal signs. Two days later, while
still sedated, intubated, and under unweanable mechanical ventilation, the patient
exhibited a sudden hypertensive crisis with vomiting and the appearance of mydriasis in
the left eye. The hypertension was immediately treated, an antiemetic was administered,
and the analgesic doses were increased. Cranial CT was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>), which revealed the presence of an acute subdural hematoma
and a parietal-occipital intracerebral hemorrhage on the left side. The patient was
immediately subjected to emergency neurosurgical treatment.</p>

      <p>The patient exhibited profuse bleeding with an onset at the beginning of surgery and
lasting throughout the transoperative period, accompanied by hemodynamic instability
that was difficult to manage despite fluid replacement, blood component transfusion, and
the use of vasoactive drugs. Following two trepanations, the hypertensive hygroma and
hematoma, which displayed both acute and chronic components, were drained. Notably, the
original neurosurgical plan had been to perform a decompressive craniotomy and to treat
the acute subdural hematoma; however, the anesthetist had to interrupt the procedure
because of progressive and refractory hemodynamic deterioration despite aggressive
management. Therefore, only the two trepanations were performed to drain the subdural
collection.</p>
      <p>Subsequently, the patient exhibited spontaneous bleeding at other sites, such as the
mouth, nose, and vagina (although the coagulation tests had been normal up to that
point), with persistence of hemolytic anemia and refractory shock. Four days after
neurosurgery, the patient presented with bilateral mydriasis and nonreactive pupils.
Sedation was discontinued, and her Glasgow score was 3. The maximal LDH level was 2,357
U/L, being 1,143 U/L at 20 days after delivery. The maximal total bilirubin
concentration was 12.23 mg/dL. The maximal direct bilirubin was 8.29 mg/dL, being 1.43
at 20 days after delivery, when the AST was 118 U/L, and the ALT was 192 U/L. The
minimal hemoglobin concentration was 4.6 g/dL and occurred five days after delivery,
whereas it had risen to 5.8 g/dL on the day neurological deterioration occurred. The
minimal platelet count was 54,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, reaching and maintaining normal levels
starting at day 15 after delivery. Leukocytosis with a left shift was found on most of
the days, with a maximum of 29,700 white blood cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. The maximal
creatinine concentration was 3.67 mg/dL, and that of urea was 202 mg/dL.</p>
      <p>Serologic tests for hepatitis and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were performed
but were negative. Furthermore, the immunological tests for systemic lupus erythematosus
and rheumatoid arthritis failed to detect any alteration. Plasmapheresis was not
performed at any time because the hypothesis of AFLP predominated in the clinical
diagnosis. Likewise, magnesium sulfate was not administered to prevent seizures because
of the late diagnosis of postpartum preeclampsia. Nevertheless, the levels of magnesium
were measured and found to be normal (2.1 to 2.4 mg/dL) throughout the
hospitalization.</p>
      <p>The diagnosis of brain death could not be established because the patient was absolutely
unresponsive to stimuli and exhibited a complete absence of brain stem reflexes upon
neurological examination, due to the refractory hemodynamic instability that had set in
combined with the clinical and neurological deterioration despite the fluid
resuscitation, use of vasopressors, and blood component transfusion. The patient died
five days after surgery, which was 22 days after the delivery.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Preeclampsia is characterized by hypertension, proteinuria, and edema. It affects
approximately 5 to 7% of pregnant women, 65% of whom might progress to HELLP syndrome.
For these reasons, preeclampsia remains a significant cause of maternal morbidity and
mortality. Typically, preeclampsia occurs during the second or third trimester of
pregnancy, but occasionally, the disease has been detected before gestational week 20.
Its consequences include hypertensive crises, kidney failure, liver rupture,
neurological complications such as seizures and stroke, and increased perinatal
morbidity and mortality. The pathogenesis of preeclampsia is believed to be associated
with placental ischemia, endothelial dysfunction, and cytotoxic and genetic factors.
Severe preeclampsia is defined by systolic arterial pressure levels that are
persistently &gt;160 mmHg or diastolic arterial pressure &gt;110 mmHg, massive
proteinuria (4+ in a dipstick, or &gt;2.0 g/24 hours), or the presence of clinical
(epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting) and laboratory (platelet count
&lt;50,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, creatine kinase &gt;200 U/L, LDH &gt;1,400 U/L, AST
&gt;150 U/L, ALT &gt;100 U/l, uric acid &gt;7.8 mg/dL, and serum creatinine &gt;1.2
mg/dL) manifestations.<sup>(<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup>
</p>
      <p>AFLP is a rare and potentially fatal disorder that might occur at the third trimester of
pregnancy, involves microvesicular fatty infiltration of hepatocytes, and has a
mortality rate of up to 70%. In most studies, the estimated incidence is 1:10,000-15,000
pregnancies, with mortality of 10 to 20%. AFLP occurs more often in multiple
pregnancies, male fetuses, and nulliparous women. AFLP is associated with inherited
defects of the mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, as well as with long-chain
3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (LCHAD), including the G 1529C
mutation.<sup>(<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup> The earliest
symptoms usually include nausea, vomiting, abdominal (mainly epigastric) pain, lack of
appetite, jaundice, fever, headache, and itch. Approximately one third of patients
exhibit signs of preeclampsia at the onset or during the progression of the disease. The
diagnosis is usually clinical and is based on the laboratory and compatible imaging
findings, including increased values for AST, ALT, bilirubin, uric acid, creatinine,
leukocytes, clotting, and electrolytes, as well as blood glucose (hypoglycemia)
disorders and lactic acidosis. The present case exhibited clinical and laboratory
features compatible with AFLP, HELLP syndrome, and severe preeclampsia. As the clinical
manifestations of AFLP prevailed at the disease onset, treatment was directed against
that condition and was thus limited to intensive clinical support care, which includes
immediate delivery following maternal stabilization because there is no specific
treatment for this disease.</p>
      <p>HELLP syndrome is a severe form of preeclampsia that usually affects 4 to 12% of women
with preeclampsia. This syndrome is associated with microthrombi, thrombocytopenia, and
clotting disorders and has a poor prognosis. HELLP syndrome may appear from the second
trimester of pregnancy up to several days after delivery; in one third of cases, the
syndrome appears after childbirth.<sup>(<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup>
HELLP syndrome is associated with vasoconstriction, increased vascular tonus, platelet
aggregation, and an altered thromboxane/prostacyclin ratio. HELLP syndrome is partially
caused by activation of the complement and consequent coagulation cascade, resulting in
endothelial and microvascular injury in multiple organs, microangiopathic hemolytic
anemia, periportal and liver necrosis with increased liver enzymes, and
thrombocytopenia. Both AFLP and HELLP syndrome affect the liver, but HELLP syndrome is
more common (1:5,000 births). AFLP tends to occur later in the pregnancy and causes
reduced liver synthetic function, resulting in hypoglycemia, increased ammonia levels,
and clotting disorders. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is common in both
conditions; however, the AST and ALT disorders and the increased LDH are more typical of
HELLP syndrome, whereas the bilirubin increase is greater in AFLP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table 2</xref>).<sup>(<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)</sup>

      <p>The risk of stroke during pregnancy is low; however, when stroke does occur, the
morbidity and mortality of its complications are high. Recent studies reported an
association between stroke during pregnancy and a history of migraine, gestational
diabetes, preeclampsia, and eclampsia,<sup>(<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)</sup> which most likely indicates physiopathological mechanisms other than
those associated with stroke that is unrelated with pregnancy.</p>
      <p>The hematological disorders occurring in these conditions increase the risk of
spontaneous postpartum bleeding, with intracranial hemorrhage as the main cause of death
in women with preeclampsia.<sup>(<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)</sup> In
addition, hypertension acts as an independent cause of stroke because the loss of the
self-regulatory mechanisms of the brain blood flow leads to vasodilation and brain
edema, particularly in the case of individuals without chronic hypertension. Brain
ischemia and hemorrhage are almost always accompanied by a blood pressure increase of at
least 10% due to alteration of the self-regulatory mechanisms induced by vasoactive
substance release at the injury site.<sup>(<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup>
</p>
      <p>Cases of spontaneous peripartum acute subdural hematoma and intracerebral hemorrhage
have been reported in the literature, but in association with the HELLP
syndrome<sup>(<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup> or with
thrombocytopenia caused by idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.<sup>(<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</sup> No case of spontaneous acute subdural
hematoma associated with AFLP could be found in the literature.</p>
      <p>The present patient exhibited an unfavorable progression partially due to the late
diagnosis of preeclampsia. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the hypertension peaks
first appeared a few days after the delivery and that the patient had undergone regular
prenatal care. In addition, the late diagnosis of fetal death contributed to the fatal
outcome. Indeed, the fetal movements had ceased two days prior to hospital admission,
and the patient had sought medical care from the very onset of the symptoms, thus
indicating a delay in the pre-hospital and emergency care. Retrospectively, one might
wonder whether plasmapheresis might have modified the clinical progression, as hemolysis
remained throughout the disease course. Plasmapheresis is indicated for patients with
persistent HELLP syndrome,<sup>(<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)</sup> but
there are no reports on the use of this modality for AFLP.</p>

      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>Preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, and acute fatty liver of pregnancy are pathological
disorders that may overlap with one another and be associated with potentially fatal
