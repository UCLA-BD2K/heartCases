        <p>Porphyria cutanea tarda is prevalent in connective tissue disease, common in
systemic lupus erythematosus. However, the co-existence of primary sjogren's
syndrome and porphyria cutanea tarda is rare and poses diagnostic and
therapeutic challenges. We report a case of porphyria cutanea tarda associated
with primary sjogren's syndrome.</p>

    <p>A 61-year-old female patient presented with increased skin pigmentation for a month in
the summer of 2009, with increased skin fragility and blisters on her forearms and
hands, as well as significant scarring. Three weeks later, these skin lesions gradually
subsided. Throughout the following three years, skin lesions worsened in spring and
summer, and abated in autumn and winter. In the summer of 2012, erythema and blisters
appeared on the double forearm and extensor muscles of the leg. She also reported
general pain and malaise, skin darkening, and yellowish urine. Subsequently, she was
admitted to hospital. Past disease history: she denied smoking and drinking; hepatitis
and tuberculosis were also denied.</p>
    <p>Physical examination: The blood pressure level was 120/70mmHg, and body temperature
36.8&#xBA;C. No jaundice and was generally in good condition. Facial hypertrichosis was
present as the darkened skin and foreseeable pigmentation. Several patches of round or
oval erythema were visible on the back of both hands and extensor muscles of both legs,
accompanied by erosions, shallow ulcers, even necrosis and scabs. The shallow scars
scattered on the hand back, with Dean positive signs. No milia were seen. Severe dental
caries were observed. Upon examination, results for the joints, lungs, abdomen, and
chest were normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

ferritin 496.7 ng/mL (RV:&lt;200ng/mL), coproporphyrins and uroporphyrin were positive
and the free protoporphyrins level was 3483g/dl (RV up to 60mg/dl). Abdominal
ultrasonography revealed fatty liver; electrocardiogram and chest X-ray were normal.
Skin histopathological examination: squamous epithelial tissue, local skin ulceration,
ulceration, dermal vessel wall fibrinoid degeneration, inflammatory cell infiltration on
vascular wall, acid-fast staining and PAS staining were negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

    <p>The preliminary diagnosis was Porphyria cutanea tard. In the treatment process, we found
a decrease in white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelet in the patient, who had
also presented teeth exfoliate, a dry mouth and dry eyes during the previous three
years, often needing the application of artificial tears. No oral ulcers, hair loss or
joint pain was reported. From the patient's clinical manifestations, we considered the
existence of Sjogren's syndrome and duly performed bone marrow puncture and labial gland
biopsy. Meanwhile, the patient was given oral hydroxychloroquine 200 mg/twice a week for
the treatment of PCT.</p>
    <p>Bone marrow puncture results showed bone marrow hyperplasia, with no thromocytogenic
megakaryocyte. ANA +(1:3200), ds-DNA -, U1RNP - , SM -, ENA -, SA +, SSB ++++, ANCA ( -
), (PR3-ANCA -, MPO-ANCA - ), IgG: 22.45g/L(RV:7-16.6g/L), IgA, IgM were normal, C3:
0.75g/L(RV:0.8-1.2g/L), C4:0.079g/L(RV:0.1-0.4g/L). Histopathological examination of
labial gland showed normal labial gland contour, partial labial gland atrophy, expanded
ducts and lymphocytes infiltrated in the lobule. All symptoms supported Sjogren's
syndrome. After the patient was treated with oral methylprednisolone tablets 24 mg/day
for two weeks, skin lesions appeared with scabs, with no new lesions; blood routine
examinations were normal, and the patient was still under follow-up.</p>
    <p>Sjogren's syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease, mainly involving exocrine glands and
divided into primary and secondary types, and the latter is associated with certain
diffuse connective tissues such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus,
and systemic sclerosis. The patient had no history of other connective tissue disease
and was thus diagnosed with primary Sjogren's syndrome.</p>
    <p>Porphyria cutanea tarda is prevalent in connective tissue disease, common in systemic
lupus erythematosus, followed by dermatomyositis. In 1952, Wolfram S et al. first
reported the existence of acute intermittent porphyria in a case with systemic lupus
erythematosus.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Information
has gradually been collected on systemic lupus erythematosus that complicate a variety
of porphyria. However, the correlation between systemic lupus erythematosus and
porphyria remains unclear.<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Sjogren's syndrome in patients with
porphyria cutanea tarda is rare; only Ramasamy R reported a case in 1982.<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In our study, the patient suffered from
a dry mouth, dry eyes, rampant tooth, occasional skin rash and facial hair for three
years, which all supported primary Sjogren's syndrome. Therefore, we suspect that this
case is porphyria cutanea tarda accompanied by Sjogren's syndrome. Further studies are
needed to focus on the pathophysiology between the two, or they just occasionally occur
in one patient. Scleroderma patients were also found to present porphyria cutanea tarda
symptoms. Hence, more diligence is needed to ascertain whether porphyria cutanea tarda
is associated with autoimmune diseases.<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>
