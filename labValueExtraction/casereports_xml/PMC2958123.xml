      <abstract>
        <p>Human patients with myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF) suffer from regionalized pathology caused by a mutation in the mitochondrial DNA (m.8344A&#x2192;G). In MERRF-syndrome brain and skeletal muscles are predominantly affected, despite mtDNA being present in any tissue. In the past such tissue-specificity could not be explained by varying mtDNA mutation loads. In search for a region-specific pathology in human individuals we determined the mtDNA/nDNA ratios along with the mutation loads in 43 different <italic>post mortem</italic> tissue samples of a 16-year-old female MERRF patient and in four previously healthy victims of motor vehicle accidents. In brain and muscle we further determined the quantity of mitochondrial proteins (COX subunits II and IV), transcription factors (NRF1 and TFAM), and VDAC1 (Porin) as a marker for the mitochondrial mass. In the patient the mutation loads varied merely between 89&#x2013;100%. However, mtDNA copy numbers were increased 3&#x2013;7 fold in predominantly affected brain areas (e.g. hippocampus, cortex and putamen) and in skeletal muscle. Similar increases were absent in unaffected tissues (e.g. heart, lung, kidney, liver, and gastrointestinal organs). Such mtDNA copy number increase was not paralleled by an augmentation of mitochondrial mass in some investigated tissues, predominantly in the most affected tissue regions of the brain. We thus conclude that &#x201C;futile&#x201D; stimulation of mtDNA replication <italic>per se</italic> or a secondary failure to increase the mitochondrial mass may contribute to the regionalized pathology seen in MERRF-syndrome.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mutations of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cause a variety of serious genetic disorders with maternal inheritance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-DiMauro1">[1]</xref>. One example is the MERRF-syndrome (<underline>m</underline>yoclonic <underline>e</underline>pilepsy with <underline>r</underline>agged-<underline>r</underline>ed <underline>f</underline>ibers, MIM 545000), which is characterized by myoclonic seizures, ataxia, dementia, muscle weakness and accumulations of structurally abnormal mitochondria in the skeletal muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-Fukuhara1">[2]</xref>. MERRF-syndrome is most frequently associated with the m.8344A&#x2192;G mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> gene (<italic>MTTK</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-Shoffner1">[3]</xref>. The mutation usually occurs in heteroplasmic state where wildtype and mutant mtDNA copies coexist. Generally, MERRF patients have a high percentage of mutant mtDNA (&gt;90%) in blood and muscle and the degree of heteroplasmy (&#x200A;=&#x200A;mutation load) is evenly distributed between different organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-Oldfors1">[4]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-Tanno1">[6]</xref>, which stands in contrast to the MELAS-syndrome (MIM 540000), where more variation is found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-Matthews1">[7]</xref>. Cultured myotubes from MERRF patients show a biochemical defect only if their mutation load surpasses 85% and show a steep decline of COX-activity and mitochondrial translation rate beyond this threshold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-Boulet1">[8]</xref>. Even though mitochondria are present in every cell, MERRF-syndrome has a regionalized pathology, predominantly involving the brain (hippocampus, cerebral cortex and striatum) and the skeletal muscle, but often sparing the heart and other intestinal organs. In the past, researchers have tried to explain this phenomenon by differences of mutation load for the m.8344A&#x2192;G mutation in the various organs. However, various studies did not confirm such an association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-Oldfors1">[4]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-Tanno1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-Lombes1">[9]</xref>. Alternatively, it was hypothesized that the affected tissues had lower threshold levels for clinical manifestation than their unaffected counterparts. Other explanations were tissue specific mechanisms for the regulation of energy metabolism, potentially at the level of mtDNA replication, transcription or translation.</p>
      <p>Here we studied the regionalized pathology of MERRF-syndrome on tissue and molecular level through investigation of 43 <italic>post mortem</italic> tissue-samples from different regions of a 16-year-old girl with MERRF-syndrome and of blood DNA samples from her family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013513-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

        <p>A tissue sample from the patient's insular cortex (Brodman area 43) including all neuronal layers and the white matter was fixed for &gt;4 weeks in phosphate-buffered 4% formaldehyde, dehydrated and subsequently embedded in paraffin. Microtome sections of 5 &#xB5;m were mounted on glass slides, deparaffinized, stained with anti-NeuN and subsequently with Cy3-labeled fluorescent secondary antibodies. The cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. An unbiased counting frame of 186.2&#xD7;139.6 &#xB5;m<sup>2</sup> was then systematically moved through the cortical layers of interest and photographs were taken on the UV and Cy3-channel through a 20&#xD7; oil immersion objective (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) with a SPOT3 cooled CCD camera (Visitron, Puchheim, Germany). From each cortical layer we analyzed five such frames which thus represented 130,000 &#xB5;m<sup>2</sup> of cross-sectional plane per respective cortical layer. The two images from the DAPI and the Cy3-channel were superimposed with false colors and on each frame we separately counted the total number of DAPI positive nuclei <italic>versus</italic> those nuclei that co-localized with a NeuN-signal representing neuronal cells that had been cut in the plane of the nucleus. All 2D-counts were corrected with the Abercrombie formula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-Abercrombie1">[10]</xref> taking into consideration the thickness of the section (5 &#xB5;m) and the diameter of the cell nuclei. The Ferret's diameter of the nuclei was 14&#xB1;5 &#xB5;m and had been determined in 50 random neuronal nuclei at their largest optical cross-sectional diameter with a 63&#xD7; oil immersion objective. The Abercrombie-corrected cell densities were then compared to published reference values that had been obtained by the same staining and 2D-counting method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-Gittins1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-Gittins2">[12]</xref>.

Myoclonic-astatic seizures started at 4 years of age. Henceforward symptoms progressed to severe pharmaco-resistant myoclonic epilepsy with series of bitemporal spike-waves on EEG and several seizures daily, progressive ataxia, deafness (hearing threshold of 65 dB SPL), and mental retardation (HAWIK IQ&#x200A;=&#x200A;76 at the age of 9 years). Serum lactate (4.1 mmol/l, N&lt;2.0) and alanine (0.60 mmol/l, N&lt;0.48) concentrations were increased and a diagnostic muscle biopsy at the age of 9 years revealed the presence of ragged-red and COX-negative fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013513-g001">Figure 1B&#x2013;F</xref>). At 14 years of age echocardiography and ECG were normal and cranial MRI revealed <italic>ex vacuo</italic> dilatation of the lateral ventricles and hippocampal sclerosis. Two years later she was found lifeless in bed and could not be resuscitated. Autopsy at 48 h <italic>post mortem</italic>, during which we were allowed to take small specimens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013513.s004">Table S1</xref>), did not discover any cardiac or pulmonary abnormalities, excluded asphyxia or aspiration, and finally <italic>status epilepticus</italic> during sleep was suspected as the cause of her death. As controls we used specimens of the same tissues from four previously healthy women (16 to 32 years), who had suffered fatal motor vehicle accidents. Additionally, we analyzed the segregation of the mutation and its mutation load in blood samples of different family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013513-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

        <p>As cells from different tissues vary considerably in their mtDNA content, we next investigated whether the remaining wildtype mtDNA molecules per cell might correlate with the regionalized symptoms. In order to calculate this figure we determined the mtDNA copies per cell for all tissues by quantitative real-time PCR (TaqMan&#xAE;) of the mitochondrial encoded <italic>MTND1</italic> gene (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, subunit ND1) <italic>versus</italic> the single copy nuclear <italic>MMP1</italic> gene (Matrix metalloproteinase 1).

Only the nuclear DNA of the pancreas seemed to be more prone to degradation at 4&#xB0;C as compared to &#x2212;20&#xB0;C. These results confirmed the constancy of the mtDNA/nDNA ratio over the selected time period, especially in brain and muscle.

        <title>Determination of the mitochondrial mass</title>
        <p>Further, we investigated whether the elevated mtDNA/nDNA ratios were solely due to enhanced mtDNA-replication or caused by a real increase of the number of mitochondrial organelles per cell (&#x200A;=&#x200A;mitochondrial mass). We thus extracted total protein from brain specimens and pectoralis muscle of patient and controls and performed a semi-quantitative Western blot analysis using antibodies against Porin (VDAC1). This protein being highly expressed at the outer mitochondrial membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-Crompton1">[22]</xref> serves as a marker for mitochondrial mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-Acquaviva1">[23]</xref>. Due to the small volumes of many biopsy specimens, we were limited in the number of tissues to be analyzed by this method but we were able to investigate hippocampus, putamen, and pectoralis muscle, representing tissues that are affected in MERRF-syndrome, and the occipital white matter and the pons, representing tissues that remain mostly unaffected. The mitochondrial mass of the patient's hippocampus and putamen was within the range of controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013513-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, a more than two-fold increase was found in pons, white matter, and skeletal muscle. Thus, we did not find a general correlation between increased mtDNA abundance and increased mitochondrial mass. On the contrary, in the investigated brain regions we <bold>either</bold> found an increase in mtDNA copy numbers <bold>or</bold> in mitochondrial mass.

        </fig>
        <p>Next we examined, whether high mtDNA copy numbers might be secondary to a stimulation of mtDNA transcription <italic>via</italic> up-regulation of mitochondrial transcription factors. Semi-quantitative Western blot analysis of the transcription factors NRF1 (nuclear respiratory factor 1) acting on nuclear genes that encode respiratory chain subunits, and TFAM (mitochondrial transcription factor A) stimulating mtDNA transcription, revealed no correlation of their amounts with the mtDNA copy number of the analyzed brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013513-g004">Figure 4C,D</xref>). The TFAM levels in the organ with one of the largest increase in mtDNA copy numbers (putamen) were even the lowest. The situation looked different in the patient's pectoralis muscle where a fourfold up-regulation of TFAM was paralleled by a similar increase of mitochondrial mass.</p>
        <p>Finally we investigated the balance of abundance between proteins encoded by the mitochondrial <italic>versus</italic> the nuclear genome. For that we determined the integrated band densities on Western blots that had been co-stained with antibodies against COX subunit II (26 kDa, mtDNA encoded) and COX subunit IV (18 kDa, nDNA encoded). Here again, the protein expression was balanced in all investigated brain regions irrespective of their mtDNA copy number and mitochondrial mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013513-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Only in muscle we found this relation considerably and unexpectedly skewed more than fourfold towards the mtDNA encoded subunit Cox II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013513-g004">Figure 4E,F</xref>). As mitochondrial mass was increased in a similar range in muscle (3.5 fold) we hypothesize that synthesis and import of nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins might not have been increased strictly in parallel. The subsequent deposition of overproduced subunits might have led to the appearance of paracrystalline inclusions in many of the muscle mitochondria as seen on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013513-g001">Figure 1C</xref>. As alternative explanation, the intense Cox II band might not represent intact subunits but misfolded or partially miscomposed polypeptide chains caused by a lack of tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> which recognizes 4 of 227 codons in Cox II mRNA.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>It is generally agreed that ATP deficiency and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are crucial factors in the pathophysiology of mitochondrial disorders due to mtDNA mutations and deletions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-DiMauro1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-Ekstrand1">[24]</xref>. ROS are generated through electron leaks in a dysfunctional respiratory chain, however, their harmful effects on the mtDNA may be mitigated, at least partially, by compensatory up-regulation of mtDNA copy numbers and mitochondrial mass. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the low &#xB5;M range increases mtDNA copy numbers and mitochondrial mass in cultures of yeast as well as human cells and cybrids harboring the 4,977 bp deletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-Lee1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-Wei1">[26]</xref>. Moreno-Loshuertos <italic>et al.</italic> (2006) even went as far as to propose that respiration deficient phenotypes caused by certain mouse mtDNA haplotypes on a uniform cybrid background be compensated <italic>via</italic> ROS-mediated increase of mtDNA copy numbers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-MorenoLoshuertos1">[27]</xref>, a view that did not remain unchallenged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-Battersby1">[28]</xref>. Hori et al. (2009) proposed an attractive link between increased ROS production and enhanced mtDNA replication <italic>via</italic> increased nicking by Ntg1 of oxidized single-stranded mtDNA at the origin of replication and thus initiating rolling cycle replication of yeast mtDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-Hori1">[29]</xref>. Whether a homologous mechanism applies for mammalian mtDNA is currently unknown.</p>
      <p>Here we demonstrate for the first time that the augmentation of mtDNA copy numbers in a MERRF patient is a tissue-specific phenomenon, which might help to explain the preponderance of certain organs for disease-specific symptoms. However, the question remains whether the up-regulation of mtDNA copy numbers is a compensatory, albeit insufficient step caused by increased ROS production in metabolically &#x201C;demanding&#x201D; tissues or whether such an up-regulation, especially if not followed by a subsequent increase in mitochondrial mass, may be harmful <italic>per se</italic> as it may exhaust the resources of the mitochondria. As TFAM is known to have an influence mtDNA copy numbers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-Ekstrand1">[24]</xref>, we investigated its expression in predominantly affected and unaffected tissues. In brain we found an especially low expression for putamen and hippocampus which did not up-regulate their mitochondrial mass despite high mtDNA copy numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013513-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This stood in contrast to white matter and pons that augmented their mitochondrial mass. In the muscle of the patient, elevated mitochondrial mass and TFAM abundance went strictly parallel demonstrating that the mechanism(s) to increase mitochondrial mass are at least partially independent of TFAM. This has already been shown in muscle specific <italic>Tfam</italic>-knockout mice that were able to up-regulate mitochondrial mass in the absence of Tfam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0013513-Wredenberg1">[30]</xref>.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, lack of sufficient autopsy material prohibited the investigation of other tissues. We are aware that the data being obtained from a single individual have to be confirmed by further investigations of MERRF patients and preferably also in individuals with other mtDNA mutations, especially the MELAS (m.3243A&#x2192;G) mutation, to explore whether a tissue-specific increase in mtDNA copy numbers is a MERRF-specific phenomenon or whether it may be generalized for other mitochondrial disorders as well.</p>
