        <p>The laparoscopic approach of pediatric surgery emergencies represents a specific preoccupation in 
hospitals everywhere in the world. Nowadays, when confronted with this pathology, pediatric surgeons are able 
to apply certain well&#x2013;defined therapeutic protocols, depending on the technical equipment at their 
disposal and their laparoscopic expertise and training.</p>
        <p>We hereby present some of the surgical pediatric emergencies that have been subjected to minimally 
invasive celioscopic techniques, in the Department of Pediatric Surgery &#x2018;Maria Sklodowska 
Curie&#x2019; Hospital, from August 1999 to July 2007. Out of 83 exploratory laparoscopies, 12 were performed 
for emergency pathology, other than acute appendicitis (in its various forms, including peritonitis) or 
acute cholecystitis. However, during the above&#x2013;mentioned period, the number of therapeutic laparoscopies 
for emergencies has grown significantly (239 from a total of 663 laparoscopies), reflecting to a large extent 
the activity of a clinic with an emergency surgery profile.</p>
        <p>The authors conclude that exploratory laparoscopies in pediatric surgery emergencies are suited for 
surgical teams with a solid experience in celioscopy and a certain professional maturity, necessary to 
correctly appreciate the surgical and anesthetic risks involved by each individual case.</p>
        <p>It is not recommended that inexperienced laparoscopic surgeons embark on the &#x2018;adventure&#x2019; of 
this minimally invasive approach for this type of pathology. Only when the training and learning process is 
fully and correctly completed, specialists are offered the advantage of continuing a celioscopic exploration 
by performing a minimally invasive therapeutic procedure, even for a pediatric emergency case.</p>

      <p>There are undeniable advantages in this minimally invasive approach to the pediatric surgical 
emergency pathology. Laparoscopy reduces the number of general complications that can occur in rare 
situations during surgery. Because of these incidents, surgeons are highly recommended to be prudent when they 
are required to appreciate the surgical and anesthetic risks for each individual case. When choosing to perform 
a surgical treatment with the help of laparoscopy, the doctor must take into consideration the risks and 
benefits of the procedure for the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>].</p>
      <p>Although appendicitis represents the most frequent pediatric surgical emergency, laparoscopic procedures 
have also been performed successfully in other pathologies such as: genital, intestinal obstruction, 
acute pancreatitis and acute posttraumatic abdomen. Its utility is undisputed, being most commonly indicated 
to obese children, to those with chronic abdominal pain that becomes acute and especially to girls at puberty 
for whom there is a suspicion of ovarian pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>&#x2013;

      <p>The laparoscopic activity of our department quickly adapted to the requirements imposed by the status of 
an emergency hospital, embracing the tendency towards minimally invasive explorations in different types of 
acute pathology, in a short period of time.</p>
      <p>In the Department of Surgery &#x2018;Maria Sklodowska Curie&#x2019; Hospital, we registered a number of 
12 exploratory laparoscopies for emergency pathology other than acute appendicitis (in its different 
forms, including peritonitis) or acute cholecystitis, from August 1999 to July 2007. The number of 
therapeutic laparoscopies in emergency cases has nevertheless been much higher (239 from a total of 
663 laparoscopies). The cases in which the positive diagnostic was corroborated with the help of surgical 
records, clinical examination and radiological exams (intestinal obstructions due to scar abdomens, peritonitis 
and genital pathology diagnosed with the help of ultrasound and clinic, complications occurred in intra 
abdominal tumors&#x2013;hemorrhage, sepsis) have been excluded from the present study. In all these 
cases, laparoscopy was performed as a minimally invasive therapeutic radical or palliative procedure.</p>
      <p>The exploratory laparoscopy has been deemed necessary in 12 situations in which the clinical 
findings, radiological and laboratory studies were not accurate. The surgical method applied (open surgery 
or minimally invasive) to these cases does not make the object of our study, but we are now able to confirm 
that the laparoscopic treatment of this kind of pathology is useful and is applied in our clinic, having very 
good results.</p>

      <p>Regarding emergencies related to the genital area, we have been confronted with three cases of intra 
peritoneum hemorrhage due to rupture of ovarian cysts. Only one of these incidents was significant, i.e. 
a 13&#x2013;year&#x2013;old female patient (hemodynamically stable) whose abdominal ultrasound was irrelevant, 
but the suggestive clinical findings for intra peritoneum hemorrhage and acute surgical abdomen imposed 
an exploratory laparoscopy. The case has been resolved in a minimally invasive manner.</p>
      <p>The cases of intestinal obstruction which were difficult to diagnose before surgery, proved to be 
mainly abdominal pains with no signs of peritoneum irritation or meteorism. We can therefore affirm that 
the intraoperative diagnosis came as a surprise. Consequently, the intestinal volvulus as a direct cause 
of lymphatic mesenteric cyst needed surgical conversion to open surgery, while the adherence syndromes 
occurring after classical appendectomies were treated laparoscopically.</p>
      <p>Although the laboratory diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is relatively easy to establish, its etiology 
is sometimes controversial. In the case of one acute pancreatitis that had a slow evolution despite 
the long&#x2013;term medical treatment, we decided to perform an exploratory laparoscopy. The biochemical 
exams have been completed by the analysis of the peritoneum fluid and ganglion&#x2013;peritoneum biopsy followed 
by immunological exams. After three weeks from the admission date, the virus etiology of the pancreatitis has 
been established. The case progressed slowly towards healing.[<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Diagram 1</xref>]</p>

      <p>The thoracic abdominal traumatology treated in our clinic is vast. Most of the posttraumatic acute abdomens 
need specific surgical treatment and are usually explored by open surgery. This classical approach is justified 
by the large amount of lesions and hemodynamic instability, which is a contraindication in laparoscopy. In the 
case of an 11&#x2013;year&#x2013;old female patient, who has suffered a stab wound in the right hypochondrium, 
the surgical team opted for an exploratory laparoscopy, which identified a superficial lesion of the 
hepatic parenchyma. The surgical solution applied was haemostasis with electro coagulation and peritoneal drain.

      <p>Employing exploratory laparoscopies in pediatric surgery emergencies is suited for surgical teams with a 
solid experience in celioscopy and a certain professional maturity, necessary to correctly appreciate the 
surgical and anesthetic risks involved by each individual case. </p>
      <p>It is not recommended that inexperienced laparoscopic surgeons embark on the &#x2018;adventure&#x2019; of 
this minimally invasive approach for this type of pathology. Only when the training and learning process is 
fully and correctly completed, specialists are offered the advantage of continuing a celioscopic exploration 
by performing a minimally invasive therapeutic procedure, even for a pediatric emergency case.</p>
      <p>For the cases of acute abdomen when imagistic examinations are not conclusive, we recommend the 
celioscopic exploration. With this procedure, we can easily establish the differential diagnosis of peritonitis 
and of other acute female genital area conditions (ectopic pregnancy, ovarian breached cyst or torsion).</p>
      <p>The recent progress of ultrasound exploration and the dosage of blood beta HCG allow an early diagnosis 
of ectopic pregnancy. On the other hand, certitude in diagnosis is only given by the exploratory laparoscopy 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. The rare cases of ectopic ruptured pregnancy in our department, 
have been treated classically (through open surgery) due to the hemodynamic instability of young patients who 
did not permit a safe laparoscopy. Nevertheless, the minimally invasive method is in principle recommended, and 
an early diagnosis would lead to a conservative laparoscopic treatment capable to maintain the fertility of 
the patient. </p>
      <p>An intra peritoneum hemorrhage occurred, following a ruptured ovarian cyst is a typical example of a 
patient explored in emergency for symptoms suggesting acute genital pathology. The clinical examination, 
previous relevant ultrasounds and a stable blood pressure create the premises for a minimally invasive 
approach even if the duration of the surgery is prolonged by the cleansing and aspiration of the peritoneal 
cavity. At the end of the laparoscopic exploratory intervention, the surgeon must be able to exclude any sign
that might suggest malignity of the ovarian cyst (intracystic vegetations) and by exploring the uterus and ovary 
on the other side to ensure that a conservatory treatment (celioscopic or open surgery) can be initiated.</p>
      <p>The fallopian tube and ovary torsion should be suspected in patients with acute pain, recurrent in 
time, localized in one of the two inferior quadrants frequently irradiating towards the external genital organs 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Doppler color ultrasound represents an excellent diagnostic method 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Intraoperatively, it is mandatory to examine the ovary and 
fallopian tube on the opposite side. According to Davis and Feins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], 
as well as to Grunewald [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], the contralateral oophoropexy must be 
taken into account in the rare cases of asyncronic torsion of the normal ovary. The torsion is 
frequently associated with tumors (cystic and solid) and must be investigated accordingly. The treatment 
consists in rotating the fallopian tube back and checking its viability to be sure of the gonad preservation

      <p>Laparoscopy also occupies a crucial place in the diagnosis of upper genital infections. In the early stages 
of infection, the clinical and biological diagnosis has a high rate of false negative and false positive 
results. Exploratory celioscopy permits the complete evaluation of the pelvis and represents the first stage of 
the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 2</xref>). Laparoscopy is always preceded by the extraction of 
the peritoneal fluid for the bacteriological exam. Pelvic examination becomes crucial for a case of acute 
abdomen of suspected genital etiology. The uterus is pushed to the front with the help of the left hand clamp 
and the Douglas is the first to be explored. Afterwards, each fallopian tube and ovary is mobilized and 
gently inspected using blunt clamps. This instrumental inspection represents an important step in the diagnosis 
of early stage salpingitis described by a rigid fallopian tube. If a uterine tube is slightly distended, 
suggestive for a salpinx beginning to suppurate, biopsy is the standard procedure applied. Sometimes, the 
simple compression of the tube on the pelvic wall externalizes the pus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11

        <p>A four&#x2013;year&#x2013;old patient is admitted for diffuse abdominal pain in the upper quadrant, 
associated with non&#x2013;alimentary vomiting and moderate meteorism. Abdominal X ray reveals hydro aerated 
images of the small bowl. The ultrasound confirms a cystic tumor of small dimensions located in the center of 
the abdomen. The decision taken is to perform an exploratory laparoscopy that diagnoses intestinal 
obstruction through volvulus of a lymphatic mesenteric cyst. The volvulus is caught in an important adherent 
bloc and the tumor cannot be celioscopically untwisted, therefore the surgeon makes the correct decision to 
resort to open surgery.</p>
        <p>What is the reason for which the surgeon chose this additional method of diagnosis of the obstructive 
cystic tumor, already detected before the surgery? Most certainly, the disproportion between the dimensions of 
the tumor and the severity of the symptoms, determined our colleague to treat with extra care an 
apparently &#x2018;simple cyst&#x2019;. Only the celioscopic image established the real and surprising 
explanation for the intense and complex symptoms, the volvulus.</p>
        <p>As a conclusion, the surgeons&#x2019; preoccupation for the minimally invasive approach in pediatric emergencies 
also refers to the suspicions of intestinal obstruction, in which the hydro aerated images are minimal to medium.
</p>
        <p>The most frequent cause of obstruction of a pre-operated abdomen is the intra-peritoneal adherences 
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 4</xref>).
 An &#x2018;old&#x2019; obstruction however, due to the 
intense distension of the abdomen that it generates, represents an obstacle to the laparoscopic method, because 
of the lack of operating space and the high risk of intestine lesions. In our study, we encountered only 
one laparoscopic exploration for a case of occlusive syndrome installed late after an appendectomy. The case 
was treated entirely laparoscopically. However, we came across many postoperative obstructive adherences 
treated celioscopically as a therapeutic method for sectioning the &#x2018;straps&#x2019; and peritoneal drain. 
The latter have not been included in the study because the surgeon did not have any doubts regarding 
the pre&#x2013;operatory clinical and radiological diagnosis.</p>

        <title>Clinical case &#x2161;</title>
        <p>An eleven&#x2013;year&#x2013;old patient is admitted in the emergency room for a right hypocondrium stab 
wound, accidentally inflicted with a sharp object. The surgeon cannot establish with certainty if the 
lesion penetrated or perforated any abdominal organs, hence he decides to perform an exploratory laparoscopy. 
The minimally invasive procedure detects a superficial lesion of the hepatic parenchyma on the diaphragmatic 
face of the right lobe. No other organs were injured. The surgical solution, also minimally invasive, consisted 
in haemostatic mono polar electric coagulation and peritoneum cavity drain for 24 hours. The 
postoperative evolution was favorable and no complications occurred.</p>
        <p>The surgeon chose this type of exploration first in an attempt to avoid a traumatizing and unaesthetic 
large classical incision in a pediatric female patient, who also benefited from the advantage of a good 
hemodynamic equilibrium.</p>
        <p>Due to the emergency status of our hospital, surgeons tend to prefer the invasive approach. Yet, once 
the celioscopic techniques have been introduced, the manner of addressing thoracic and abdominal trauma has 
been revised. The presented case is a good example of a medium amplitude trauma, which we recommend to 
be laparoscopically explored. On the contrary, it is not recommended to treat patients with severe physical
 trauma (road accident casualties, sport injuries, &#x2018;white weapons&#x2019; aggressions) through 
minimally invasive techniques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 5</xref>). The large incision of an open 
surgery has both an exploratory and a therapeutic purpose, allowing a good surgical haemostasis of 
important vessels pedicle and organs.</p>

        <p>Phillip Rossi and David Mullins from Dallas, Texas, published a prospective research, carried out on 
32 abdominal penetrating and non&#x2013;penetrating traumas, subjected to exploratory celiotomy. After 
using celioscopy as a first procedure in all these cases, a 16%&#x2013;19% error has been noticed 
in identifying lesions that have been later detected by classic surgery. There were multiple areas with 
lesions, which remained undetected laparoscopically: liver, pancreas, stomach, duodenum small bowl, 
mesentery, ureter and urinary bladder. Subsequent complications emerged in 6.25% of cases 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. </p>
        <p>It is certain that there are different abdominal areas that cannot be explored in detail through 
laparoscopy, but the celioscopic evaluation of penetrating abdominal trauma has nevertheless a high rate 
of accuracy. </p>
        <p>Even though diagnostic laparoscopy has a reduced sensitivity (&lt;50%) for superficial lesions 
of intra&#x2013;abdominal organs, it has an excellent sensitivity (96.2%) and specificity (100%) 
to establish the need of a therapeutic open surgery.</p>

          <p>The acute posttraumatic abdomen is &#x2018;a slippery slope&#x2019; for the laparoscopic
