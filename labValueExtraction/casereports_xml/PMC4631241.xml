      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 35-year-old female and her 38-year-old sister presented to our department with
asymptomatic, small, hypopigmented macules distributed symmetrically on the limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). In both patients, the spots were visible
when extremities were placed in a dependent position and disappeared when limbs were
raised. Lesions started appearing in the older sister around the age of 25, while in the
younger sister, they appeared when she was about 30. There were no mucosal or nail
abnormalities and no associations with acrocyanosis or hyperhidrosis. The women had no
history of vascular disease or other relevant pathological conditions. No other family
member had had similar lesions. Routine laboratory tests yielded normal results. Tests
for cryoglobulin, antiphospholipid antibody, antinuclear antibody, and proteins S and C
were all negative. On the basis of the characteristic clinical manifestations, Bier
spots (BS) were diagnosed. The patients did not receive treatment.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>BS consists of asymptomatic, small, irregular, hypopigmented macules characterized by a
normal histological appearance, which are usually found in individuals aged 20-40 and
more frequently in women than men.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The skin surrounding the lesions may be
normal or mildly erythrocyanotic. BS are typically distributed symmetrically on the
limbs and tend to appear with venous congestion when patients stand, while they usually
disappear if venous flow is enhanced by the elevation of affected extremities. Cases
with trunk involvement and generalized lesions have also been described.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Furthermore, BS have rarely been reported
in association with conditions such as scleroderma renal crisis, pregnancy,
cryoglobulinaemia, coarctation of the aorta, hypoplasia of the aorta, palmar
hyperhidrosis, tachycardia, varicosity, lichen planus, alopecia areata and Peutz-Jeghers
syndrome.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> BS are thought to be
an exaggerated but physiological, vasoconstrictive response induced by venous
stasis-associated hypoxia or, conversely, by a failure of the venoarteriolar reflex in
dermal ascending arterioles in response to venous filling. Other possible pathogenetic
mechanisms involved in the development of the lesions include rheological abnormalities
such as hyperviscosity induced by cryoglobulinaemia.<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The main differential diagnoses for BS include disorders either
with white macules caused by hypopigmentation (pityriasis versicolor, vitiligo, achromic
nevus, postinflammatory hypopigmentation, etc), or those caused by vascular
abnormalities (nevus anemicus).<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Since
the condition usually resolves spontaneously, no specific treatment is
required.<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In our report we observed the simultaneous presence of BS in two siblings, which is
unusual since, to the best of our knowledge, concurrent familial cases have never been
reported in the literature.</p>
      <p>Although we cannot exclude the possibility that familial occurrence of BS may be casual,
we speculate that such an event suggests genetic characteristics may be a factor in the
development of the condition, for example a predisposition to an aberrant vasomotor
response of the small cutaneous vessels or rheological abnormalities. Importantly, some
authors have hypothesized that certain alleles in an autosomal gene locus predispose to
skin vasodilatation or vasoconstriction, holding that one of the alleles in particular
is responsible for increased vasodilation, and that its homogenous allele accounts for
increased vasoconstriction. According to the hypothesis, the functional balance between
the two alleles results in a normal vascular tonus; however, some genetic aberrations
could lead to an imbalance towards an increased skin vasoconstriction, thus favoring the
onset of BS.<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In conclusion, this is the first ever report on BS in two siblings; the rarity of
familial cases, as well as sporadic forms, is likely due to the fact that the condition
is asymptomatic and often goes unnoticed.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> We hope that this report will stimulate further reports and studies,
in order to confirm or not the possible role of a genetic component in the genesis of
BS.</p>
