      <abstract>
        <p><italic>TUBA1A</italic> mutations cause a wide spectrum of lissencephaly and brain malformations. Here, we report two patients with severe cortical dysgeneses, one with an extremely thin cerebral parenchyma apparently looking like hydranencephaly and the other with lissencephaly accompanied by marked hydrocephalus, both harbouring novel <italic>de novo</italic> missense mutations of <italic>TUBA1A</italic>. To elucidate how the various <italic>TUBA1A</italic> mutations affect the severity of the phenotype, we examined the capacity of the mutant protein to incorporate into the endogenous microtubule network in transfected COS7 cells by measuring line density using line extraction in an immunofluorescence study. The mutants responsible for severe phenotypes were found to incorporate extensively into the network. To determine how each mutant alters the microtubule stability, we examined cold-induced microtubule depolymerisation in fibroblasts. The depolymerisation of patients&#x2019; fibroblasts occurred earlier than that of control fibroblasts, suggesting that microtubules bearing mutated tubulins are unstable. Both mutations are predicted to participate in lateral interactions of microtubules. Our data suggest that the <italic>TUBA1A</italic> mutations disrupting lateral interactions have pronounced dominant-negative effects on microtubule dynamics that are associated with the severe end of the lissencephaly spectrum.</p>

  <body>
    <p>In the past two decades, it has become evident that the genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins are important in the developing brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Their importance was initially inferred from the identification of genes encoding microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), such as <italic>LIS1</italic> (also known as <italic>PAFAH1B1</italic>) and <italic>DCX</italic>, which are mutated in the lissencephaly spectrum<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Several years later, new disorders associated with mutations in genes encoding for &#x3B1;- or &#x3B2;-tubulin were described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The &#x3B1;- and &#x3B2;-tubulins are the major components of microtubules and are characterised by variable isotypes whose expressions are spatially and temporally regulated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Mutations in a number of neuronally expressed tubulin genes are associated with a spectrum of cortical development malformations commonly referred to as tubulinopathies. These disorders are caused by mutations in <italic>TUBA1A</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <italic>TUBB2B</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, <italic>TUBB3</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, <italic>TUBB</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <italic>TUBB4A</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <italic>TUBB2A</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, and <italic>TUBG1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> genes. These mutations thought to involve varying degrees of abnormal neuronal proliferation, migration, and postmigrational development that result in a large spectrum of malformations, including lissencephaly, pachygyria, polymicrogyria, and microcephaly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p>
    <p>Microtubules are ubiquitous structural components that contribute to the cytoskeleton, cilia, flagella, axon fibres, and mitotic spindles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Microtubules are dynamic polymers consisting of tandem repeats of &#x3B1;- and &#x3B2;-tubulin heterodimers, which assemble in a head-to-tail fashion at the growing ends of microtubules. Each microtubule is constructed from 13 laterally connected protofilaments of repeating tubulin heterodimers; lateral interactions between each microtubule form the hollow and cylindrical microtubule body<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p>
    <p><italic>TUBA1A</italic> gene encoding &#x3B1;1a-tubulin is expressed in almost all post-mitotic neurons throughout neuronal development. <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-related cortical dysgenesis typically shows a posteriorly predominant lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia (LCH), dysmorphic basal ganglia, thin or absent corpus callosum, congenital microcephaly, ventricular dilatation, and abnormalities of the hippocampus and brainstem<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. However, the clinical phenotypes caused by <italic>TUBA1A</italic> mutations vary considerably. Recently, <italic>TUBA1A</italic> mutations have also been described in perisylvian asymmetrical polymicrogyria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, polymicrogyria-like cortical dysplasia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, and microlissencephaly in foetal cases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The clinical manifestations of affected patients often include congenital microcephaly, severe intellectual disability, neurodevelopmental delay with diplegia or tetraplegia, and epilepsy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p>
    <p>In our study, we performed whole-exome sequencing of two patients with severe cortical dysgeneses. One patient had an extremely thin cerebral parenchyma apparently looking like hydranencephaly, whereas the other had lissencephaly accompanied by marked hydrocephalus. We identified two novel <italic>de novo</italic> heterozygous <italic>TUBA1A</italic> mutations, c.190 C&gt;T (p.R64W) and c.74 G&gt;T (p.C25F). In addition, we performed a functional assay of the mutant proteins to determine why these patients show more severe phenotypes than patients with classical lissencephaly.</p>

        <title>Patients&#x2019; characteristics</title>
        <p>Patient 1 (NCU_F41) was a 3-year-old girl. She was born at a gestational age of 37 weeks by caesarean section. Her parents were healthy and unrelated. Her elder sister was also healthy and had normal development. Her mother was referred to our hospital for foetal growth restriction, microcephaly, and marked ventricular dilatation of her foetus on ultrasonography from 28 weeks of gestation. At patient delivery, the amniotic fluid was excessive but the placenta and umbilical cord were normal. Her Apgar scores were 3 and 5 at 1 and 5&#x2009;min, respectively. She could not breathe spontaneously and needed mechanical ventilation. Her birth weight was 2116&#x2009;g (&#x2013;2.0SD), head circumference was 29.6&#x2009;cm (&#x2013;2.4SD), and body length was 44&#x2009;cm (&#x2013;1.8SD). She had microcephaly, microphthalmos, widely spaced eyes, and micrognathia. Truncal hypotonia with spastic tetraplegia was evident and her digital joints were contractured.</p>
        <p>An ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia. Foetal MRI at 28 weeks of gestation and brain MRI at 6 days after birth revealed an extremely thin cerebral parenchyma, hypoplastic brain stem, and agenesis of the cerebellum and corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a&#x2013;d</xref>). Test results for toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex (TORCH) infections were negative. Her karyotype was normal 46, XX. After birth, she presented with focal clonic seizures, sometimes with oxygen desaturation. Her electroencephalogram showed extremely poor background activities and focal rhythmic delta waves during the seizures. As the seizures were treated with phenobarbital, they were partially controlled.</p>
        <p>At the age of 1 month, a tracheotomy and tracheal separation were performed because of her recurrent aspiration pneumonia. A gastrostomy and fundoplication were also done at the same time. Because of the agenesis of the pituitary, trichlormethiazide for central diabetes insipidus and hydrocortisone and levothyroxine for hypopituitarism were needed. Since her head circumference had been gradually enlarged, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed at the age of 7 months to control the head growth and to assist in nursing care. At 3 years of age, she had spastic tetraplegia and no definite awareness of her environment.</p>
        <p>We performed whole-exome sequencing of peripheral blood DNA from the patient and both her parents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1a</xref>). A <italic>de novo</italic> heterozygous c.190 C&gt;T (p.R64W) variant was identified in <italic>TUBA1A</italic>. Subsequent Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of this variant in the patient 1 and absence in the genomes of both her parents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). The c.190 C&gt;T variant was predicted to be damaging by both PolyPhen-2 and SIFT. No potentially pathogenic variants related to malformations of cortical development were identified in any other genes in patient 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Patient 2 (K3373) was a 2-year-old boy. Ventricular dilatation was identified in the foetal period. His parents were healthy and unrelated. His elder sister was also healthy and had normal development. He was born at a gestational age of 39 weeks by vaginal delivery. His Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5&#x2009;min, respectively. His birth weight was 2792&#x2009;g (&#x2212;0.9SD), head circumference was 33&#x2009;cm (&#x2013;0.2SD), and body length was 49.5&#x2009;cm (+0.3SD). After birth, he was diagnosed with lissencephaly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e&#x2013;h</xref>). He could breathe and swallow by himself. At the age of 8 months, he began suffering from epileptic spasms, which could be controlled with sodium valproate and zonisamide. At 2 years of age, he had spastic tetraplegia and was unable to roll over. Although he would not make eye contact and did not speak, he could react to sound and had a smile when his mother called his name.</p>
        <p>We performed whole-exome sequencing of peripheral blood DNA from the patient and both his parents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1b</xref>). A <italic>de novo</italic> heterozygous c.74 G&gt;T (p.C25F) variant was identified in <italic>TUBA1A</italic> and confirmed by Sanger methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). This variant was not detected in the genomes of both his parents by Sanger sequencing. The c.74 G&gt;T variant was predicted to be damaging by both PolyPhen-2 and SIFT. There were no potentially pathogenic variants related to malformations of cortical development in any other genes in patient 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Both <italic>TUBA1A</italic> mutations of patients 1 and 2 are located at the amino acids which are conserved across many species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1c</xref>).</p>

        <p>Both <italic>TUBA1A</italic> mutations reported here are located in the N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1d</xref>) and are predicted to be associated with lateral interactions between microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a&#x2013;c</xref>). According to structural studies conducted using cryoelectron microscopy, protofilaments in microtubules are primarily connected between the M loops and the H1&#x2032;-S2 and H2-S3 loops<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. R64 is located on the H1&#x2032;-S2 loop of &#x3B1;-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), which participates in lateral interactions. R64 forms hydrogen bonds with the surrounding residues, E3, F53, and S54 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). These hydrogen bonds may be involved in the structural stability and/or flexibility of the lateral interactions. Therefore, the R64W mutation is predicted to directly disrupt the lateral interaction. C25 is located on the boundary between helix H1 and the H1-H1&#x2032; loop of &#x3B1;-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), and this residue faces the luminal side of microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The H1-H1&#x2032; loop appears to support the H1&#x2032;-S2 loop and the H2-S3 loop to enhance lateral interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Therefore, the C25F mutation may secondarily compromise lateral interactions.</p>

        <title>TUBA1A mutants alter the ability of &#x3B1;-tubulin to incorporate into the microtubule network</title>
        <p>We examined the ability of the TUBA1A mutants to incorporate into the endogenous microtubule network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). We generated constructs designed to express TUBA1A mutants upon transfection of COS7 cells. The constructs were for wild-type, p.R64W, and p.C25F, as well as p.R402C, which is a recurrent <italic>TUBA1A</italic> mutation that expresses the phenotype of classical lissencephaly, similar to <italic>LIS1</italic> mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Transfected cells were examined by immunofluorescence using an anti-FLAG antibody to detect the expression of the transgene and an anti&#x2013;&#x3B1;-tubulin antibody to detect the overall microtubule network. At 24&#x2009;h post-transfection, we found that FLAG-tagged wild-type TUBA1A was visualised as lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,B</xref>) and colocalised with the &#x3B1;-tubulin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,C</xref>), suggesting that FLAG-tagged wild-type TUBA1A could incorporate into the microtubule network. On the other hand, we found that FLAG-tagged mutant TUBA1A was visible not only as lines, but also as puncta that were diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,E,H,K</xref>). The linear staining merged with &#x3B1;-tubulin, but the puncta did not colocalise with &#x3B1;-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,F,I,L</xref>), suggesting that some of the mutant TUBA1A protein could not incorporate into the microtubule network. We observed more incorporated FLAG-tagged TUBA1A protein with R64W and C25F transfection than with R402C. To exclude the influence of the acidic charges of the FLAG tag, we also examined the incorporation of the Myc-tagged TUBA1A protein. Consistent with the data of the FLAG-tagged protein, the incorporation into the microtubule network of Myc-tagged mutant TUBA1A was less than wild-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>).</p>
        <p>To quantify the incorporation of mutant protein in each transfected cell, we determined the linear staining of FLAG-tagged TUBA1A of each cell by using the ImageJ KBI Line Extract plug-in for line extraction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3a</xref>). These lines indicated the microtubule network of incorporated FLAG-tagged TUBA1A. After line extraction, we measured the total length of the lines and calculated the line density of each cell. The microtubule density of FLAG-tagged TUBA1A for each mutant transfection was analysed.</p>
        <p>We found that the microtubule density of FLAG-tagged mutant TUBA1A was significantly lower than that of FLAG-tagged wild-type TUBA1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,A</xref>). Among TUBA1A mutants, the microtubule density of R64W was the highest, whereas that of R402C was the lowest. We also calculated the microtubule density of &#x3B1;-tubulin in the same manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,B</xref>). We found that the microtubule density level followed the same order as that of FLAG-tagged TUBA1A. Therefore, the amount of the overall microtubule network tended to depend on the amount of incorporated overexpressed TUBA1A protein. These data indicated that R64W tended to permit higher levels of microtubule incorporation than C25F and R402C. Because there were no significant differences in the mean relative FLAG intensities, the expression levels of FLAG-tagged protein in the analysed cells were thought to be similar among wild-type and mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3b</xref>).</p>
        <p>To assess microtubule dynamics in transfected COS7 cells, we examined repolymerisation after cold induced depolymerisation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). There were significantly less cells containing the asters of &#x3B1;-tubulin in the cases of R64W transfection than wild-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5c</xref>).</p>

        <title>TUBA1A mutants alter microtubule stability</title>
        <p>We investigated microtubule behaviour in patients&#x2019; fibroblasts to assess the effects of these mutations on the microtubule stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Microtubules of fibroblasts start to depolymerise when they are incubated on ice. We examined the cytoskeleton morphology and the depolymerised tubulin in the fibroblasts by immunofluorescence staining of &#x3B1;-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). We first showed by RT-PCR that <italic>TUBA1A</italic> was actually expressed in fibroblasts of the patients and control fibroblasts (control_1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). We defined a cell that contained no linear staining of &#x3B1;-tubulin at 400&#xD7; magnification to be a completely depolymerised cell. We compared the percentage of completely depolymerised cells between patients&#x2019; fibroblasts and control ones when they were incubated on ice for 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20&#x2009;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). There were no completely depolymerised control or mutant cells after 0 and 5&#x2009;min of cold treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,A&#x2013;F</xref>). After 10&#x2009;min of cold treatment, we found that the percentage of completely depolymerised cells from the R64W and C25F patients was more than four times that of the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,G&#x2013;I,b</xref>). The differences for comparison R64W and C25F cells with control cells were statistically significant (<italic>p&#x2009;</italic>=&#x2009;5.6&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>&#x2212;24</sup> and <italic>p</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.8&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>&#x2212;14</sup>, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). This suggested that the depolymerisation of patients&#x2019; fibroblasts occurred sooner than the control ones. There were almost no differences in the percentage of depolymerised cells after 20&#x2009;min of cold treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,M&#x2013;O,b</xref>). Repolymerisation of the microtubules could occur in control and mutant fibroblasts after treatment on ice for 20&#x2009;min and subsequently at 37&#x2009;&#xB0;C for 15&#x2009;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,P&#x2013;R</xref>) . These data suggested that mutated microtubules are less stable than normal ones.</p>
        <p>To assess an underlying mechanism by which <italic>TUBA1A</italic> mutations lead to cortical dysgeneses, we examined the mitosis and the migration of the patients&#x2019; fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7, S8</xref>). There were no significant differences between the patients&#x2019; and control fibroblasts both in the mitosis and in the migration.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In our present study, we identified two novel heterozygous missense <italic>TUBA1A</italic> mutations in patients with severe cortical dysgeneses, one with an extremely thin cerebral parenchyma apparently looking like hydranencephaly and the other with lissencephaly accompanied by marked hydrocephalus. <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-related cortical dysgenesis typically shows a posteriorly predominant lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia (LCH), dysmorphic basal ganglia, thin or absent corpus callosum, congenital microcephaly, ventricular dilatation, and abnormalities of the hippocampus and brainstem<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Without these characteristics, it is difficult to determine whether a case with certain brain malformations is a <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-related disorder using only MRI findings. The brain MRI of our patient harbouring the <italic>TUBA1A</italic> p.R64W mutation manifested an extremely thin cerebral parenchyma with severe hydrocephalus, agenesis of the cerebellum and the corpus callosum, and hypoplastic brain stem, the most severe form of brain malformations. It looked like hydranencephaly but was distinguished from hydranencephaly by the existence of an extremely thin cerebral parenchyma. The cerebral cortex was too thin to assess the layer structure using brain MRI. Thus, our data indicate that the spectrum of <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-related brain malformations is broader than expected.</p>
      <p>All previously reported, <italic>TUBA1A</italic> mutations have been heterozygous missense mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The presence of missense mutations and the absence of nonsense mutations, frameshifts, or whole gene deletions suggest that the mutation results in gain-of-function or has a dominant-negative effect, rather than haploinsufficiency. Among tubulinopathies, it has been proposed that the severity of nervous system impairments may depend on the relative abundance of mutant &#x3B1;- and &#x3B2;-tubulin heterodimers compared with wild-type, combined with their ability to incorporate into the microtubule cytoskeleton, which affect dynamics, motor protein, or MAP interaction in different dominant-negative fashions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the case of <italic>TUBB3</italic> mutations, R262H substitution permits much more heterodimer formation and microtubule incorporation than R262C, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in mammalian cells. R262C results in isolated eye movement restrictions, whereas R262H causes not only severe eye movement restrictions, but also other neurological impairments and brain malformations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In the same way, the recurrent R402H mutation in <italic>TUBA1A</italic>, which causes a more severe lissencephaly with complete agyria than R402C, produces a mutant protein that permits higher levels of heterodimer formation and microtubule incorporation than R402C<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. We showed that R64W had the highest amounts of mutant protein incorporation into the network compared with the other mutants and caused the most severe phenotype. In the repolymerisation experiments, the expression of TUBA1A R64W protein impaired the ability of the endogenous &#x3B1;-tubulin to repolymerise. Thus, a greater extent of mutant protein incorporation into the endogenous microtubule network may result in more severe phenotypes in a dominant-negative fashion.</p>
      <p>In the current study, the data of the incorporation of FLAG-tagged R402C TUBA1A was different from the previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. The reason of the difference could be based on the position of the FLAG tag. To exclude the influence of the acidic charges of the FLAG tag, we also examined the incorporation of the Myc-tagged TUBA1A protein. Consistent with the data of the FLAG-tagged protein, limited incorporation of the R402C mutation was observed and the data did not depend on the type of tags. According to the previous report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, the R402C mutation generated tubulin heterodimers in significantly reduced yield <italic>in vitro</italic> folding reaction. It may be consistent that the R402C mutation disrupts &#x3B1;&#x3B2; heterodimerisation, leading to little incorporation into the microtubule network.</p>
      <p>Tubulin contains three separate structural domains, N-terminal, intermediate, and C-terminal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1d</xref>). These three domains participate in five distinct functions: heterodimer stability, longitudinal and lateral protofilament interactions, nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis, and microtubule&#x2013;protein interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In neurons, lateral interactions are particularly important because microtubules are arranged in dense networks and must be resistant to forces that cause bending or buckling to maintain their structural integrity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Mutations found at positions essential for lateral interactions are predicted to impede the polymerisation and dynamic properties of microtubules, resulting in microtubules that may be relatively nondynamic or unstable and more likely to depolymerise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In cold-induced depolymerisation of fibroblasts, it is consistent that the two TUBA1A mutants, R64W and C25F, could make microtubules less stable than those of the controls by disrupting lateral interactions.</p>
      <p>We investigated the severity of <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-related cortical dysgeneses that are associated with lateral interactions in previous reports as well as in this report. <italic>TUBA1A</italic> mutations that primarily participate in lateral interactions include L286F<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> (M loop), E55K<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, T56M<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, R64W (H1&#x2032;-S2 loop), and L92V<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> (H2-S3 loop). The patients harbouring L286F, T56M, and L92V were foetuses. Using the classification of Kumar <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, four mutations (L286F, T56M, R64W, and L92V) are classified in the severe lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia (LCH severe group 4). On the other hand, E55K belongs to the moderate lissencephaly (LIS moderate group 1) with extreme microcephaly. There are also neighbouring loops that may support lateral interactions. The H1-H1&#x2032; loop supports the H1&#x2032;-S2 loop and the H2-S3 loop, and the end of H6 and the S9-S10 loop appear to stabilise the M loops<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. <italic>TUBA1A</italic> mutations that secondarily participate in lateral interactions include C25F, E27Q<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> (H1-H1&#x2032; loop), Y210C<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, D218Y<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> (the end of H6), G366R<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, A369T<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, and V371E<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> (S9&#x2013;S10 loop). Five mutations (E27Q, Y210C, D218Y, G366R, and V371E) were classified into the LCH severe group 4 and C25F resembled the LCH severe group 4 phenotype except for milder cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. Only A369T showed central pachygyria. Therefore, many of the reported <italic>TUBA1A</italic> mutations at positions associated with lateral interactions caused severe phenotypes of brain malformations (LCH severe group 4).</p>
      <p>In the case of &#x3B2;-tubulin, R62 of TUBB3 is also positioned in the H1&#x2032;-S2 loop of &#x3B2;-tubulin and is predicted to participate in lateral interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. However, patients harbouring R62Q have a milder phenotype among TUBB3 mutations. As it was reported that residues involved in lateral interactions cluster in regions of divergence between species and marked difference between &#x3B1;- and &#x3B2;-tubulins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, there may be different consequences for &#x3B1;- and &#x3B2;-tubulins when lateral interactions are disrupted. We propose that the differences in clinical manifestations among tubulinopathies caused by a mutated tubulin gene should be evaluated.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our data suggest that mutations in <italic>TUBA1A</italic> at positions essential for lateral interactions may lead to severe phenotypes of brain malformations. However, we did not show the consequences of these mutants for neuronal developmental processes such as proliferation, migration, differentiation, and axonal guidance. In patients&#x2019; fibroblasts, the mitosis and the migration were not impaired. Further studies of how each mutant affects microtubule function and how it impairs neuronal developmental processes will reveal the precise function of microtubules in normal neuronal development.</p>

        <p>Quantification of microtubule density was performed as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. For each COS7 cell, a region of interest (ROI) was manually assigned along the edge of the cell by the free hand tool in ImageJ. We then calculated the area and the mean intensity of the ROI by using the ImageJ ROI manager. We used the KBI Line Extract plug-in for line extraction. The parameters were giwsIter 5, mdnmsLen 20, pickup above 0.0, shaven Len 5, and del Len 5. The total length of the extracted lines was calculated by the KBI Line Feature plug-in in ImageJ for the &#x3B1;-tubulin staining and the FLAG staining. The total length of the extracted lines in a selected cell divided by the area of the cell gave the microtubule density. These plug-ins are available as part of the KBI ImageJ plug-in package (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hasezawa.ib.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/zp/Kbi/ImageJKbiPlugins">http://hasezawa.ib.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/zp/Kbi/ImageJKbiPlugins</ext-link>). The relative FLAG intensity was determined in ImageJ by subtracting the mean red signal intensity of an untransfected cell from that of a transfected cell. The untransfected cell was in the same image as that of the transfected cell.</p>

        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) End-on view of a microtubule structural model. A microtubule consists of 13 longitudinal protofilaments that are connected via lateral interactions. &#x3B1;-tubulin molecules are blue, &#x3B2;-tubulin molecules are white, R64 residues are red, and C25 residues are orange. (<bold>b</bold>) Side view of a microtubule. C25 residues are not shown in this view because they are located on the luminal side of a microtubule. (<bold>c</bold>) Higher resolution image of the lateral interaction between the &#x3B1;-tubulin molecules. Both light blue and dark blue are &#x3B1;-tubulin molecules. The M loop is gold, the H1&#x2032;-S2 loop is red, the H1-H1&#x2032; loop is green, and the helix H1 is yellow. The R64 and C25 residues have side chains in this figure. (<bold>d</bold>) The R64 residue forms hydrogen bonds with surrounding residues, E3, F53, and S54.</p>

        <title>The ability to incorporate into the microtubule network varies among TUBA1A wild-type and mutants.</title>
        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Transfected COS7 cells were examined by immunofluorescence using an anti-FLAG antibody (red) and an anti&#x2013;&#x3B1;-tubulin antibody (green). C-terminal FLAG-tagged wild-type TUBA1A was visualised as lines (B) and colocalised with the cytoskeleton of &#x3B1;-tubulin (C). In the case of FLAG-tagged mutant TUBA1A, there were fewer lines than with the wild-type (E,H,K). Insets are magnified images of the boxes. Scale bar, 20&#x2009;&#x3BC;m. (<bold>b</bold>) Quantification of microtubule density. We extracted linear staining of FLAG-tagged TUBA1A (A) and the overall cytoskeleton network of &#x3B1;-tubulin (B) of each cell by using the ImageJ KBI Line Extract plug-in and calculated the line density of each cell. Bars represent the means&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;SEM (32 cells from wild-type, 28 cells from R64W, 28 cells from C25F, and 31 cells from R402C). Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences (one-way ANOVA and Tukey&#x2019;s post-hoc test; *<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05, **<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). (A) The microtubule density of FLAG-tagged mutant TUBA1A was significantly lower than that of FLAG-tagged wild-type TUBA1A. The microtubule density of R64W was the highest among the mutants and that of R402C was the lowest. (B) The microtubule density level of &#x3B1;-tubulin followed the same order as that of FLAG-tagged TUBA1A.</p>

        <title>Microtubule behaviour and stability in patients&#x2019; fibroblasts after various periods of cold treatment.</title>
        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Before cold treatment, the cytoskeleton morphologies were similar among control and mutant fibroblasts (A&#x2013;C). Note that fibroblasts of R64W and C25F were depolymerised after 15&#x2009;min of cold treatment, whereas polymerised microtubules were still present in control fibroblasts (J&#x2013;L). Scale bar, 20&#x2009;&#x3BC;m. (<bold>b</bold>) Percentage of completely depolymerised cells after cold treatment of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20&#x2009;min. We counted completely depolymerised cells among 275&#x2013;400 cells in each condition. After 10&#x2009;min of cold treatment, the percentage of R64W and C25F fibroblasts showing depolymerisation was more than four times that of control fibroblasts. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared with control (Fisher&#x2019;s exact test and Bonferroni correction using numbers of cells with and without complete depolymerisation, *<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05, **<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001).</p>
