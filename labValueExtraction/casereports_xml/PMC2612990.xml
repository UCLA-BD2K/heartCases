        <p>Iris cyst excision involves complex surgical maneuvers and may
have a variable visual outcome depending upon preexisting and
postoperative complications. Hereby, we report a case series
of 10 eyes from which posttraumatic iris cysts were excised
and proven histopathologically. Histopathology records were
reviewed. Data regarding patient profile, clinical profile, surgical
details, treatment outcomes and follow-up were reviewed.
Outcome measures were defined as recurrences, visual acuity
and number of other surgeries required. Non-parametric
Wilcoxon test was used to compare changes in the visual acuity
and Fisher test was used to find out the significance of several
risk factors. Mean age was 24.7 years (3-58 years). Mean follow-
up was 2.36 years. Mean preoperative logMAR visual acuity
was 0.56 in comparison to final logMAR visual acuity of 1.62.
Factors related to adverse functional outcome were related to
post-surgical complications.</p>

    <p>Iris cysts are classified as primary or secondary, with primary
cysts being more common.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Secondary iris cysts develop as a
result of trauma,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> intraocular parasites,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> tumors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> or prolonged
use of topical drugs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> Traumatic iris cysts are rare.
These can either be &#x2032;solid looking&#x2032;, lined by stratified or cubical epithelium
(pearl cyst), or a serous cyst, containing straw-colored turbid
fluid. This is due to deposition of surface epithelial cells from
the conjunctiva or cornea on the iris after surgical [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] or
penetrating trauma [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. This study evaluates the clinical
profile and histopathological features of traumatic iris cysts in
Indian subjects and elucidates their surgical management and
treatment outcome.</p>
    <sec sec-type="">
      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>A chart review was done on all patients presenting with
traumatic iris cyst from 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2006.
Data were collected for clinical profile, history of ocular
trauma and/or surgery, ocular findings, type of surgery,
histopathological features, postoperative complications
and follow-up. For statistical analysis, the non-parametric
Wilcoxon test was used to compare changes in visual acuity
at presentation and at last follow up. Fisher test was used to
find out the significance of several risk factors with appropriate
significance (<italic>P</italic>&lt; 0.05).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="">
      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Ten patients were identified with traumatic iris cysts. Patients
ranged in age from three years to 58 years with a mean of
24.70 + 17.32 years (Mean +  SD). Six were males and four were
females. Four patients had a history of corneal wound repair
following trauma and three had prior cataract surgery, while
one patient had prior vitrectomy and cataract surgery. On
examination, iris cyst was found attached to cornea in three
eyes. Anterior chamber involvement was measured in terms of
clock hour involvement [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Preoperative logMAR vision
ranged from 0 to 1.69 with mean of 0.56 +  0.52 and postoperative
logMAR vision ranged from 0 to 4.0 with mean 1.62 +  1.62.
Follow-up ranged from 0.1 year to 7 years with mean 2.36 +
2.60 years. In all cases, cysts were found to be expanding with
time and causing complications such as visual axis obstruction,
iritis, glaucoma, and corneal decompensation. Ultrasound
biomicroscopy (UBM) was done in eight cases [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>] and the
extent and involvement of the other structures was identified
[<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>]. In the remaining two cases, this could be determined
by clinical examination alone. All patients underwent removal
of cyst with additional surgical procedures done where
necessary [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Histopathology revealed all cysts to be
lined by multiple layers of nonkeratinized stratified squamous
epithelium. The contents of the cysts were empty in all cases
[<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. On application of Fisher&#x2032;s test, iris cyst attachment
to cornea (<italic>P</italic>=0.50), extension to ciliary body (<italic>P</italic>=0.50), clock hour
involvement of anterior chamber (<italic>P</italic>=0.60), intact removal of iris
cyst (<italic>P</italic>=0.22) and nature of injury (<italic>P</italic>=0.70) with respect to final
visual acuity was found to be statistically insignificant (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05).
Wilcoxon signed rank test showed statistically significant poor
postoperative vision (<italic>P</italic>=0.028) at last follow-up in comparison
to vision at presentation. No recurrence was noticed in any
case till last follow-up.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Two types of iris implantation cysts have been described
depending upon their gross examination. The first is named
as pearl or epithelial cyst which is a solid-looking cyst lined
by stratified squamous epithelium having concentric lamellar
layers and clear cystic space in the center. The other one is
known as serous cyst.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> It has a thin wall and is lined by stretched
out and flattened atrophic epithelium containing chronic
inflammatory or cellular exudates. Meanwhile, epithelial
ingrowth mainly consists of avascular membrane progressing
on the corneal endothelial and iris surface.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> Treatment of
epithelial ingrowth has traditionally involved aggressive
excision of cellular proliferation and associated tissue as well
as ablative therapy to excision site to eradicate residual cells.
One of the challenges is to identify the full extent of ocular
involvement by the epithelial cellular incursion, so as to treat it
completely. In the present study, histopathological examination
of the excised iris cyst revealed that nine cysts were epithelial
or pearl cyst, and one was serous cyst. In cystic ingrowths,
the tissue margins are clearly defined and readily seen during
surgery. However, the best treatment is not yet determined
and it is unclear whether laser treatment, surgical removal or
cyst aspiration with/without laser photocoagulation/surgical
removal offers the best chance of control. There have been
reports of iris cysts being treated with aspiration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> to collapse
the cyst but this might lead to recurrence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> Some have reported
success with block excision techniques.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> As an alternative to
surgical removal, laser treatment with Nd-YAG to rupture
the cyst were also reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> In the present study
all cysts underwent total excision with/without iridocyclectomy.
Additional surgical procedures like lensectomy, vitrectomy,
penetrating keratoplasty and intraocular (IOL) removal were
done, where necessary. Six (60%) cases showed no complication
after treatment with good visual outcomes (mean logMAR
0.45), which was clinically significant. Three cases were of
pediatric age group, less than 18 years. Two were males and
one female. The median logMAR vision was 0.60. All three
underwent excision of cyst. Additionally, one case required
penetrating keratoplasty. Median final logMAR acuity was
0.47. The case that underwent keratoplasty had graft failure,
resulting in poor anatomical and visual outcome.</p>
      <p>Overall, poor final visual acuity in the present study
was attributable to uncontrolled glaucoma and graft failure
as postoperative complications [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. One patient who
underwent excision of cyst and lens removal developed
uncontrolled glaucoma and three patients who underwent
penetrating keratoplasty along with cyst removal developed
graft failure. These four patients had mean postoperative
logMAR vision of 3.37 and the remaining six patients had mean
postoperative logMAR vision of 0.45, which was better than
the preoperative, mean logMAR vision of 0.56 in 10 patients.
It is because of very poor vision in these four patients that
mean postoperative logMAR became poorer than preoperative
logMAR, overall. Best visual outcomes were obtained in eyes
that did not have any postoperative complications.</p>
      <p>Traumatic iris cyst is difficult to manage and has poor visual
outcomes if associated with postoperative complications.
Appropriate surgical management appears to be a good
treatment option in the management of such eyes.</p>
