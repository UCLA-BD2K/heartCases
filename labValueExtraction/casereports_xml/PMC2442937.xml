		<p>Increasing surgical experience with the immediate consequences of pancreatic injuries has resulted from
parallel growth in the volume of motor vehicle accidents and societal violence. However, few surgeons
are aware that complications may be considerably delayed following pancreatic trauma, occurring in
some cases months to years after apparent recovery from the original injury. In four patients with blunt
pancreatic trauma initially treated by non-operative means, stricture of the main pancreatic duct
developed over a period of months as a result of progressive fibrosis at the site of ductal injury.
Pancreatic duct hypertension was demonstrated to be present in the obstructed duct, and secondary
changes of chronic pancreatitis developed in the obstructed segment of the gland (&#x201C;upstream&#x201D; chronic
pancreatitis). Seven similar patients with delayed onset of chronic obstructive pancreatitis after
pancreatic trauma were found in the literature. Symptoms related to these acquired ductal strictures are
most commonly those of abdominal pain and recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. Recognition of
post-traumatic chronic obstructive pancreatitis principally involves awareness that injuries to the
pancreatic duct can produce remote complications. Pancreatoenteric drainage, or resection of the
obstructed segment of pancreas, provides prompt and effective relief.</p>
