      <abstract>
        <p>Fanconi anaemia (FA) is a hereditary disease featuring hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linker-induced chromosomal instability in association with developmental abnormalities, bone marrow failure and a strong predisposition to cancer. A total of 17 FA disease genes have been reported, all of which act in a recessive mode of inheritance. Here we report on a <italic>de novo</italic> g.41022153G&gt;A; p.Ala293Thr (NM_002875) missense mutation in one allele of the homologous recombination DNA repair gene <italic>RAD51</italic> in an FA-like patient. This heterozygous mutation causes a novel FA subtype, &#x2018;FA-R', which appears to be the first subtype of FA caused by a dominant-negative mutation. The patient, who features microcephaly and mental retardation, has reached adulthood without the typical bone marrow failure and paediatric cancers. Together with the recent reports on RAD51-associated congenital mirror movement disorders, our results point to an important role for RAD51-mediated homologous recombination in neurodevelopment, in addition to DNA repair and cancer susceptibility.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Fanconi anaemia (FA) is a rare recessive genetically heterogeneous chromosomal instability disorder with both autosomal and X-linked inheritance. All reported cases so far displayed a recessive mode of inheritance. FA is characterized by multiple congenital abnormalities, haematological defects and a high predisposition to a diversity of cancers. including childhood acute myeloid leukaemia and head and neck cancers. Patient-derived cells are extremely sensitive to DNA interstrand cross-linking agents, such as mitomycin C (MMC) or diepoxybutane (DEB)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Standard FA diagnosis therefore involves the determination of chromosomal breaks and radial formation after exposure to DEB or MMC.</p>
    <p>FA is a well-known example of how the study of a rare genetic disease can reveal novel molecular pathways. FA proteins were found to act together in a distinct genome maintenance pathway referred to as the FA/BRCA pathway, which is involved in the repair of DNA&#x2013;DNA cross-links as well as DNA double-strand breaks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Central in the pathway is the monoubiquitination of the FA proteins FANCD2 and FANCI, which is carried out by a multi-protein complex consisting of FANCA, -B, -C, -E, -F, -G, -L and -M. The FA proteins FANCD1 (BRCA2), -J (BRIP1), -N (PALB2), -O (RAD51C), -P (SLX4) and -Q (XPF) all act downstream of this monoubiquitination step. Recently, also biallelic <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations have been described to cause a FA-like syndrome (&#x2018;FA-S')<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p>
    <p>Loss of the DNA repair function is thought to underlie the cancer predisposition. The FA/BRCA pathway research focused mainly on the different steps in DNA repair through homologous recombination (HR). This pathway is essential for accurate repair of double-strand breaks in mammalian cells. The key step in HR is homologous strand exchange mediated by the RAD51 protein. RAD51 binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent manner to form a nucleoprotein filament able to invade duplex DNA and search for homology; RAD51 directly interacts with the FA protein BRCA2. However, RAD51 has not been identified as a FA protein so far. Furthermore, despite the extensive work to elucidate the function of FA proteins in response to DNA interstrand cross-link damage, the mechanism by which the FA/BRCA pathway responds to this genotoxic insult is not fully understood.</p>
    <p>In this study, we describe an atypical adult male FA patient who had been excluded from all known FA subtypes by standard FA diagnostic DNA mutation analysis. This patient does not display the typical FA-related bone marrow failure and cancer, but features mental retardation. We sequenced the whole genomes of the patient, a healthy sister and the parents, and identified a <italic>de novo</italic> mutation in the <italic>RAD51</italic> gene of the patient as the disease-causing mutation. Proteomics experiments indicate that both the mutant and wild-type RAD51 are expressed in the patient-derived cells, suggesting a dominant-negative mode of action. In line with this, mutant RAD51 acts as a dominant negative in an inducible cell model. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the mutation affected crucial steps in HR: formation of a joint molecule between a processed DNA break and the repair template, ATP hydrolysis, DNA binding and filament formation. Moreover, mutant RAD51 can interfere with binding of wild-type RAD51 to DNA. Altogether, the data indicate that the heterozygous <italic>RAD51</italic> mutation causes a novel FA subtype, &#x2018;FA-R', which appears to be the first subtype of FA caused by a dominant-negative mutation.</p>

        <p>The FA-like individual presented at 2.5 years of age with growth retardation, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, skeletal (thumb and radius) abnormalities, imperforate anus and an improperly formed left testicle. A positive DNA cross-linker (DEB)-induced chromosomal breakage test confirmed the suspicion of FA. The patient has now reached adulthood (23 years) lacking the typical FA features such as bone marrow failure and malignancies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Somewhat atypical for FA was his strong learning disability associated with an intelligence quotient test score of about 70. Cellular tests using blood lymphocytes and SV40-transformed fibroblast cell lines established at age 5 years, confirmed the hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Following treatment with MMC, immortalized fibroblasts from the patient showed an excessive accumulation in the late S&#x2013;G2 phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Using growth inhibition as an end point, patient-derived cell lines were hypersensitive not only to MMC, but also to camptothecin (CPT) and the poly-(adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, KU58948 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d&#x2013;f</xref>), suggesting that the cells are impaired in DNA repair. The results are consistent with a defect in the downstream branch of the FA/BRCA pathway, as western blot analysis demonstrated a normal level of FANCD2 monoubiquitination in the individual's lymphoblastoid and fibroblastoid cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Whole-genome and -exome sequencing</title>
        <p>To identify the disease-causing mutation(s), we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> on DNA from the proband, his parents and his unaffected sister. Relationship estimation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> based on the parents' genomes confirmed paternity and excluded consanguinity. Furthermore, we sequenced the exome from the patient to confirm variants identified by WGS. As recessive inheritance is typical for FA, we explored this possibility by examining genes harbouring either homozygous or compound heterozygous potentially disease-causing mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>; arrow 1). The candidate mutations had the following characteristics: very rare (minor allele frequency &lt;0.01) and scoring positive in at least two out of four pathogenicity-prediction programs. Using data from the healthy sister as a negative control, this filtering approach resulted in only one candidate gene: <italic>PRR12</italic>. We tested this candidate gene with a prioritization approach tailored for the FA/BRCA pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. This tool considers the entire proteome exploiting the basic FA protein properties, protein&#x2013;protein interactions (Molecular Interactions workflow of EnVision 2), protein function prediction (FuncNet) and literature mining (Nermal).

In keeping with this, short interfering RNA knockdown experiments did not result in an FA-like phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.

The mutation affects an amino acid (aa) at a highly conserved position, and results in a substitution, p.Ala293Thr (NM_002875), that is predicted to be damaging by three different tools (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). The variant was also found in the exome data. Subsequent Sanger sequencing was consistent with the WGS and exome data for the patient and family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, right panel). Furthermore, the mutation was also identified in complementary DNA (c.877G&gt;A) obtained from proband-derived lymphoblasts and from skin fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). The latter finding excludes the possibility that the mutation was acquired during lymphoblast cell culturing and demonstrates that the mutant allele could be stably expressed at the messenger RNA level.

We thus hypothesized that the human counterpart would have a similar effect. To test this, we generated a fibroblast cell line with inducible expression of the human mutant <italic>RAD51</italic>, and a cell line with the wild-type gene as control. Expression of the RAD51 mutant gave rise to elevated spontaneous and MMC-induced chromosomal breaks, when compared with the same cell line that overexpressed the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Furthermore, the induced expression of the variant allele sensitized the cells to killing by the cross-linking agents MMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>) and CPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Although total levels of RAD51 are clearly higher in the induced cell lines, expression of the induced wild-type and mutant RAD51 proteins was in the same range, excluding the possibility that the observed negative effects on cell growth could be attributed to higher expression levels of the mutant protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.

We did not observe significant differences in RAD51 subcellular localization between wild-type and patient cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Furthermore, we were able to detect RAD51 foci upon challenge with DNA-damage-inducing agents MMC and hydroxyurea (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).

        <p>To determine the molecular mechanism underlying the DNA repair defect observed in cells expressing RAD51<sup>A293T</sup>, we performed a number of biochemical experiments.

The p.Ala293Thr mutation in RAD51 reduced the formation of D-loop intermediates by ninefold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, right panel).

        <title>Impaired ATPase activity and DNA binding by RAD51<sup>A293T</sup></title>
        <p>To uncover the stage of HR that is negatively impacted by the p.Ala293Thr mutation, we tested several functions of RAD51 related to its role in HR. We tested whether the mutation affected the ATPase activity of RAD51. As previously reported, wild-type RAD51 displayed a low constitutive ATPase activity that is stimulated approximately twofold by ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In contrast, RAD51<sup>A293T</sup> had a somewhat lower baseline ATPase activity that could not be stimulated by DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The lack of DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of the mutant protein suggests a lower affinity for binding to DNA. To directly test this possibility, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments using both double-stranded and ssDNA. Double-strand DNA-binding affinity of wild-type RAD51 and RAD51<sup>A293T</sup> was tested under identical conditions. DNA binding by wild-type RAD51 resulted in a discrete band in the EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Quantification revealed that half of the DNA was bound at 0.3&#x2009;&#x3BC;M and binding was saturated at 0.8&#x2009;&#x3BC;M RAD51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). By contrast, RAD51<sup>A293T</sup> did not produce a discrete band. Instead a slight smear was detected, just above the unbound double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), but only at protein concentrations an order of magnitude higher than needed for efficient DNA binding by wild-type RAD51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). When ssDNA was used, wild-type RAD51 binding was saturated at a concentration of 0.4&#x2009;&#x3BC;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>), while it took a 10-fold higher concentration for RAD51<sup>A293T</sup> to shift all of the DNA probe. Furthermore, DNA binding by RAD51<sup>A293T</sup> resulted in a qualitatively different protein&#x2013;DNA complex with faster mobility than that formed between wild-type RAD51 and ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). We conclude that the p.Ala293Thr mutation attenuates the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of RAD51 and negatively affects the binding of RAD51 to both single- and dsDNA.</p>

        <title>Distorted RAD51<sup>A293T</sup> nucleoprotein filament formation</title>
        <p>A key structural intermediate in DNA repair through HR is the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Although EMSA experiments allow quantification of protein&#x2013;DNA complexes, they do not reveal any information on their architectural arrangement. By contrast, several structural features of RAD51&#x2013;DNA complexes can be quantified by scanning force microscopy (SFM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Wild-type RAD51 was incubated with 3.9-kbp dsDNA in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ATP, and the reaction mixture was analysed by SFM. Under these conditions, RAD51 forms stable highly regular nucleoprotein filaments of defined length that completely cover the DNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f, i</xref>). With the same conditions, some of the observed DNA did have bound RAD51<sup>A293T</sup> protein (examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f, ii</xref>), but the SFM analysis revealed that these DNA&#x2013;RAD51 complexes differed markedly from the regular wild-type nucleoprotein filaments. DNA molecules were only partly covered with protein, in the form of short RAD51<sup>A293T</sup> filament patches, which tended to associate with each other and naked DNA along the same molecule making them difficult to analyse further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f, ii</xref>).</p>
        <p>To analyse the effect of the p.Ala293Thr mutation on RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments in more detail, we assembled RAD51&#x2013;DNA complexes in conditions expected to stabilize otherwise unstable filaments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> at 30&#x2009;mM KCl instead of the 100&#x2009;mM used above. Under these conditions, the p.Ala293Thr protein was able to form more extensive nucleoprotein filaments from which several structural aspects could be reliably quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f, iv</xref>). Filaments formed with wild-type protein look much the same in the lower- and higher-salt conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>, compare i with iii). In contrast to wild-type RAD51, the RAD51<sup>A293T</sup> nucleoprotein filaments contain apparent gaps in protein coverage and irregular protein arrangement especially evident at the ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f, iv</xref>). The differences in architecture were quantified by measuring the length and the height of the filaments. Binding of RAD51 to dsDNA changes the helical pitch such that the DNA molecule extends to 1.5-fold its B-form length<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. If filament formation is not complete, DNA will be less extended and the filaments shorter. The wild-type RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments on the 3.9-kb DNA were 2,025&#xB1;67&#x2009;nm long, while filaments formed on the same-length DNA with RAD51<sup>A293T</sup> were 1,752&#xB1;105&#x2009;nm long. Discontinuities in the filament are detected in SFM images as a reduction in height from the average of 2.2&#xB1;0.4&#x2009;nm to less than 1&#x2009;nm. On this 3.9-kb DNA, we rarely observed discontinuities in filaments formed with wild-type RAD51; on average 0.29 locations with a height below 1&#x2009;nm per filament (<italic>n</italic>=17 filaments). In contrast, discontinuities were frequent if filaments were formed with the RAD51<sup>A293T</sup> protein; on average 17.4 locations below 1&#x2009;nm observed per filament (<italic>n</italic>=25 filaments). The appearance of the filaments in SFM, their decreased length and more frequent discontinuities, indicate that although RAD51<sup>A293T</sup> can form filaments on DNA, they are less stable and possibly defective specifically in filament elongation. Thus, the mutation interferes with the crucial function of RAD51 to form functional nucleoprotein filaments.</p>

        <title>RAD51<sup>A293T</sup> interferes with wild-type RAD51 DNA binding</title>
        <p>As RAD51 functions in the context of a helical nucleoprotein filament that requires repeated monomer&#x2013;monomer contacts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, it is possible that defective DNA binding of the mutant could impose a dominant-negative effect on the function of wild-type RAD51. Indeed, titrating in RAD51<sup>A293T</sup> in reaction mixtures containing dsDNA and a fixed amount of wild-type RAD51 affected the ratio of different protein&#x2013;DNA complexes detected in the EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>). At a concentration of 0.4&#x2009;&#x3BC;M wild-type RAD51, both protein&#x2013;DNA complexes and unbound DNA were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>). At a ratio of 1:8 mutant to wild-type protein, overall DNA binding increased slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h</xref>). This observation is consistent with RAD51<sup>A293T</sup> being incorporated in the nucleoprotein filament formed by wild-type RAD51, as it does not bind DNA by itself at that concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). At a 1:4 ratio, the relative amount of the fully shifted discrete band started to decrease, while protein&#x2013;DNA complexes causing an intermediate shift were increased. At a 1:1 ratio, which still represents a protein concentration (0.4&#x2009;&#x3BC;M) at which the RAD51<sup>A293T</sup> protein by itself did not bind DNA, most of the shifted DNA detected had an intermediate mobility. Interestingly, under those conditions all unbound DNA had disappeared. Given that at a concentration of 0.8&#x2009;&#x3BC;M wild-type RAD51 all DNA is present in a fully shifted discrete band, the disappearance of the fully shifted discrete band and the unbound DNA with the concomitant appearance of DNA with intermediate mobility suggests that mixed complexes containing both wild-type and mutant RAD51 form on DNA and these protein&#x2013;DNA complexes are less stable than those containing only wild-type RAD51. We conclude that the presence of the RAD51<sup>A293T</sup> protein quantitatively and qualitatively affects DNA binding by wild-type RAD51 supporting a dominant-negative effect of the mutant protein on the wild-type function.</p>
        <p>The RAD51-ATP-DNA filament catalyses the central DNA strand-exchange step of HR DNA repair by coordinated dynamic changes at multiple RAD51 interfaces (protein&#x2013;protein, protein&#x2013;ATP and protein&#x2013;DNA; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>).

The protein&#x2013;interaction interface displays different conformations associated with ATP- or ADP-binding status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref> right panel), which gives rise to high-affinity or low-affinity ssDNA binding, respectively. The region harbouring the mutation is thus implicated in RAD51 protein dynamics. Our data point to a crucial aa in this region whose alteration results in disturbed dynamic interactions evident as less stable DNA binding, loss of DNA-binding coordinated ATPase and disrupted filament structure. In the presence of the wild-type protein, apparently some function is retained, which may explain the viability of the FA-like patient. This study thus links a <italic>RAD51</italic> mutation to a novel clinical phenotype, that is, an FA-like disorder, which implies that the gene name <italic>FANCR</italic> may be added as a synonym to the official gene symbol, <italic>RAD51</italic>. Different types of mutations in human <italic>RAD51</italic> are thus associated with different clinical phenotypes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Until now FA research has primarily focused on malignancies and bone marrow failure, which constitute the prime life-threatening symptoms. Notably, not all FA patients acquire bone marrow failure. Indeed, this phenotype has not been associated with patients affected by biallelic mutations in <italic>BRCA2</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) and <italic>RAD51C</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> who, together with the proband of the current study, seem to compose a distinct subtype. Intriguingly also the recently described cases of biallelic carriers of <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, had reached adulthood without bone marrow failure. Instead these two individuals developed breast and serous ovarian cancer as adults, respectively. It could be hypothesized that individuals with a <italic>de novo RAD51</italic> mutation also have an increased susceptibility for cancer as adults and thus careful surveillance is warranted.</p>
      <p>In addition, our study highlights the association of mental retardation/aberrant neurological functioning as a clinical feature linked to RAD51. In early reviews, a link between FA and mental retardation/central nervous system has been established, albeit at a low frequency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Also the two cases with biallelic <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations were found to be associated with developmental delay, while for one of the patients, mental retardation was mentioned explicitly. Thus, it could be hypothesized that absence of paediatric bone marrow failure, but presence of mental retardation/brain disorders is preferentially associated with individuals with defects in proteins of the downstream branch of the FA pathway. Intriguingly, FA cells are also exquisitely sensitive towards acetaldehyde, a metabolite of ethanol linked to fetal alcohol syndrome, which is an important cause of learning disability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>.</p>
      <p>Thus our study seems to warrant further exploration on the role of the FA/BRCA pathway in the (developing) brain and how this pathway may counteract toxic insults, such as exogenous ethanol. In addition, our data emphasize that dominant mutations can be responsible for diseases usually thought of as (autosomal) recessive and that genome-wide sequence data of family members combined with mechanistic studies may be necessary to pinpoint the responsible gene.</p>

(2) Next, we filtered for rare variants having a minor allele frequency equal or smaller than 1% in the European American population of the 1000genomes project<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and the NHLBI ESP exomes (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://esp.gs.washington.edu">https://esp.gs.washington.edu</ext-link>), as well as in the control data set CG69 provided by CG. (3) Variants were filtered out, for which in the index patient both alleles were called reference. If one or both alleles of the index patient were not called, the variant was not filtered out at this stage. (4) When applying a recessive inheritance model, we filtered for variants that were either called homozygous in the index patient and not in the unaffected sibling and heterozygous in the parents or compound heterozygous allowing for no call alleles. Here we filtered for two different heterozygous variants within the same gene coming from different parental genomes and both not present in the unaffected sibling. (5) Variants were annotated using ANNOVAR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> using the NCBI RefSeq Release 60 and Ensembl Release 74 genome annotations. Only exonic variants were kept that were annotated as non-synonymous, frameshift insertion/deletion, non-frameshift insertion/deletion/substitution, stop gain, stop loss and variants disrupting splice sites up to two bases into intron or exon. The remaining variants were then assessed using SIFT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, Polyphen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, MutationTaster<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> and CADD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> for pathogenicity. Ingenuity Variant Analysis (Qiagen) and the Family Genomics Workflow (familygenomics.systemsbiology.net/software) provided independent candidate lists, and were used for confirmation of the primary analysis. Whole-exome sequencing was performed after enrichment with SureSelect Human All Exon Kit (Agilent) targeting &#x223C;38&#x2009;Mb, and sequenced on one lane of an Illumina GAIIx instrument using a paired-end sequencing protocol. To detect and evaluate SNVs and small indels, reads were mapped to the GRCh37 reference genome (hg19) by the Burrows&#x2013;Wheeler Aligner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Subsequently, SNVs and small indels were called using SAMtools<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> and VarScan<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. The resulting list of variants was annotated with ANNOVAR.

        <p><bold>Author contributions</bold> The study is part of a programme aimed at the identification of novel FA genes conceived by J.P.d.W. (deceased), J.C.D. and J.d.D.. This project was designed by J.P.d.W., J.C.D., J.d.D., N.A., D.G., L.H., R.G. and R.B. The RAD51 biochemical studies were designed and supervised by C.W. and R.K. Whole-genome and -exome sequence data analysis was performed by P.M., N.A., J.R., R.G., G.G. and H.L. Three-dimensional modelling analysis of RAD51 was performed by G.W. The additional (functional) genomic studies were performed by N.A., A.H., H.J.v.d.V., J.B., D.R., A.B.O. and M.A.R. R.D. and E.V. provided clinical information on the proband at adult age. O.B.B. and A.F.M.A. were involved in the RAD51 proteomics experiments. S.E.v.R.-F. and D.R. performed the RAD51 biochemical studies. N.A., A.H., P.M. and J.C.D. contributed to the preparation of the report and the figures. R.K. wrote the section on the RAD51 biochemical studies. All authors contributed ideas and provided feedback on the manuscript.</p>

        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Analysis of inducible cell model. Chromosomal breaks. An increased number of cells with chromosomal breakage after treatment with MMC was observed for cells in which the expression of the mutant RAD51 allele (LN9SV+MUT) was induced compared with cells in which the wild-type RAD51 allele (LN9SV+WT) was induced; <italic>P</italic> value=0.001 (<italic>&#x3C7;</italic><sup>2</sup>-test). NT, &#x2018;no treatment'; MMC, &#x2018;treatment for 48&#x2009;h with 50&#x2009;nM MMC'. (<bold>b</bold>) CellTiter-Blue test. The viability of cells expressing the mutant allele (LN9SV+MUT) was compromised after treatment with MMC when compared with the cells expressing the wild-type allele (LN9SV+WT) or the wild-type cells transduced with the empty vector (LN9SV+TET). The average of three experiments is shown. (<bold>c</bold>) Growth inhibition test (cell counting). Wild-type cells expressing the mutant RAD51 allele are sensitive to MMC compared with wild-type cells expressing the wild-type RAD51 allele. Error bars indicate the s.d. from triplicate experiments.

        <title>RAD51 in relation to human disorders.</title>
        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) ClustalW alignment of human, mouse and yeast RAD51 proteins demonstrating the conservation of the mutated aa (arrow). In addition the L1 and L2 important for DNA binding are shown, as well as the Walker A and Walker B regions, which have been implicated in nucleotide binding; the mutation is directly next to the L2 loop. (<bold>b</bold>) Crystal structures of <italic>Methanococcus voltae</italic> RADA (MvRadA, archaeal RAD51 homologue) have been solved in complex with the ATP mimic AMPPNP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> (PDB 2F1H) and with ADP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref> (PDB 3FYH), providing the greatest structural insight into functionally relevant RAD51 forms. The AMPPNP&#x2014;a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue&#x2014;bound RAD51 dimer is shown in surface representation with each RAD51 monomer coloured differently. This shows that the motif surrounding the proband's mutation (magenta) is at the dimer interface (top). The equivalent residue to Ala293 in MvRadA is a glycine (red), although the surrounding motif is highly conserved (inset sequence alignment). Close-up views of the nucleotide-bound states of MvRadA (right) show that when bound to AMPPNP&#x2014;a high-affinity ssDNA-binding state&#x2014;the motif that contains the proband's mutation forms a small alpha-helix. This helix interacts with the bound nucleotide and the Walker A box (green). The region also neighbours the L2 loops that bind to ssDNA (spheres at the end of the L2 loops show regions of disorder in the crystal). In contrast, when bound to ADP&#x2014;a low ssDNA-binding state&#x2014;the proband's mutation motif has shifted position away from the nucleotide and Walker A box, and transitioned from an alpha-helix to a partially disordered loop with additional disorder seen in the L2 loops compared with the AMPPNP state. The position of the mutation in the protein supports the notion that mutation affects RAD51 protein dynamics. (<bold>c</bold>) Cartoon showing the different effects of changes of RAD51 on clinical phenotypes. A dominant-negative mutation can give rise to an FA-like disorder, haploinsufficiency (that is, lower levels) of RAD51 can give rise to a neurological disorder, while aberrant RAD51 expression levels in tumours have been associated with therapy response.</p>
