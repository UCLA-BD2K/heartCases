        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>A solitary spherical mass was found in the caudal part of the cranial lobe of
the left lung of a 28-month-old Japanese Black cow. The mass was circumscribed, embedded
in the lung parenchyma and not connected to the liver or diaphragm. Histologically, the
mass comprised hepatocytes, portal structures consisting of interlobular bile ducts,
interlobular arteries and interlobular veins, and central veins. Based on the histological
findings, a diagnosis of intrathoracic ectopic liver was made. Considering the absence of
any previous history of traumatic diaphragmatic hernia or surgery, the mass might have
resulted from a congenital abnormality. To our knowledge, this is the first report of
intrathoracic ectopic liver in a cow that might have resulted from a congenital
abnormality.</p>

  <body>
    <p>An ectopic liver is generally asymptomatic and an incidental finding discovered during
surgery or necropsy [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In humans, an ectopic liver is
often located adjacent to the pancreas [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], gallbladder
[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], spleen [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]
or native liver [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, very rarely, it is found
in the thoracic cavity [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In veterinary medicine,
intrathoracic ectopic liver caused by traumatic injury has previously been reported in a cat
[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but no reports have described intrathoracic
ectopic liver in cattle. This study describes an intrathoracic ectopic liver in a cow that
might have resulted from a congenital abnormality.</p>
    <p>A 28-month-old Japanese Black cow weighing 794 kg was brought to a meat inspection center in
good condition. The cow had no previous history of traumatic diaphragmatic hernia or surgery
and showed no clinical abnormalities before being submitted for meat inspection. On gross
inspection, a solitary spherical mass (6 &#xD7; 6&#xD7; 5 cm) was found in the caudal part of the
cranial lobe of the left lung, enveloped by the serous membrane and embedded in the lung
parenchyma. The gross cut surface of the formalin-fixed mass was elastic, firm,
well-circumscribed and brown in color (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Gross cut surface of the formalin-fixed mass and lung. The cut surface of the mass (M)

evident in any other organ.</p>
    <p>The mass was fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin and sectioned and
was then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE), Hall&#x2019;s method and Watanabe&#x2019;s silver
impregnation. The EnVision Polymer Method (DAKO Cytomation, Kyoto, Japan) was used for
immunohistochemical staining. Anti-hepatocyte monoclonal antibody (1:25, clone OCH1E5; DAKO
Cytomation) and anti-cytokeratin monoclonal antibody (1:50, clone AE1/AE3; DAKO Cytomation)
were used as primary antibodies. Endogenous peroxidase was inactivated with 3%
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-methanol. Autoclaving (121&#xB0;C for 15 min) was used for antigen
retrieval. Detected antigens were visualized with 3, 3&#x2032;-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride
reagent. Sections were counterstained with Mayer&#x2019;s hematoxylin. Normal bovine liver was used
as a positive control.</p>
    <p>Histologically, the mass was circumscribed, surrounded by fibrous connective tissue and
separated from lung tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>The mass (M) is circumscribed, surrounded by fibrous connective tissue and separated
from lung tissue (L). HE. Bar=200 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-711-g002"/></fig>). It comprised sheets of polygonal hepatocytes arranged uniformly and radially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>The mass comprises hepatocytes and portal structures consisting of interlobular bile
ducts, interlobular arteries and interlobular veins. HE. Bar=50 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>m</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-711-g003"/></fig>). Portal areas consisting of interlobular bile ducts, interlobular arteries and
interlobular veins were present. Central veins were also seen at the center of hepatic
lobules. The histological structures and streams of interlobular arteries, interlobular veins,
central veins and sublobular veins showed no significant differences in comparison to normal
bovine liver tissues. No blood vessels could be seen connecting the mass with the lung tissue.
Hall&#x2019;s method revealed no bile production. Watanabe&#x2019;s silver impregnation revealed clear
hepatic cords and abundant reticular fibers lining sinusoids. Immunohistochemically,
hepatocytes were positive for anti-hepatocyte monoclonal antibody and negative for
anti-cytokeratin monoclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_004" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Immunohistochemistry of hepatocytes and interlobular bile ducts using anti-hepatocyte

Mayer&#x2019;s hematoxylin counterstaining. Bar=50 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>m</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-711-g004"/></fig>). Interlobular bile ducts were positive for anti-cytokeratin monoclonal antibody and
negative for anti-hepatocyte monoclonal antibody. These results were the same as in the normal
bovine liver tissues used as positive controls. Based on the histological findings,
intrathoracic ectopic liver was diagnosed.</p>
    <p>Intrathoracic ectopic liver is a rare finding in humans and other animals [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The ectopic liver typically consists of histologically
normal liver tissue in humans [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In this study, the mass
likewise comprised histologically normal liver tissue. But, the ectopic liver has a higher
neoplastic potential than the native liver [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The anti-hepatocyte monoclonal antibody is a highly
specific and sensitive marker for human and canine hepatocytes (including normal, hyperplastic
and neoplastic hepatocytes), and hepatocytes show granular and diffuse intracytoplasmic
immunoreactivity, but the bile duct epithelia do not react [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Similarly, in this case and normal bovine liver tissues used as positive
controls, hepatocytes were positive for the anti-hepatocyte monoclonal antibody, and
interlobular bile ducts were negative immunohistochemically.</p>
    <p>According to one previous report about human intrathoracic ectopic liver [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the intrathoracic ectopic liver had an autonomous
vascular supply and a biliary system draining into other organs or no apparent drainage
system. The vascular supply to the mass seemed to come from the aorta during surgery in
another previous report about human intrathoracic ectopic liver [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but no vascular supply to the mass could be recognized during meat
inspection in the present case and the histological findings could not show any vascular
supply from lung tissue. Given the long-term survival of the mass that comprised
histologically normal liver tissue, the mass must have received the vascular supply from the
surrounding tissues or blood vessels. But, the vascular supply to the mass in this case
remains uncertain, because of the absence of clinical examinations, such as ultrasonographic
techniques and angiography. Additionally, considering the absence of histological findings
suggesting bile production, no biliary drainage system seemed to be present in this case.
Although the histological findings were similar to those of the native liver, the
intrathoracic ectopic liver in this case might not have performed functions similar to the
native liver.</p>
    <p>The possible mechanisms of the development of an intrathoracic ectopic liver in humans may be
congenital abnormality, as an abnormal development of both the liver and diaphragm during the
embryonic period, acquisition secondary to traumatic diaphragmatic hernia and acquisition
secondary to hematogenous dissemination of liver tissue following a heart transplantation
procedure [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].
One of the possible mechanisms reported previously in human intrathoracic ectopic liver
resulting from a congenital abnormality is the development of another liver bud independent of
the main hepatic diverticulum that remains sequestered in the thoracic cavity without
connection to the native liver [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the present case, considering the necropsy findings and previous
history, the mass might have resulted from a congenital abnormality, and the above-mentioned
mechanism might explain the pathogenesis of the present case.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, a solitary mass found in the lung of a cow was diagnosed as an intrathoracic
ectopic liver. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an intrathoracic ectopic liver
that might have resulted from a congenital abnormality in cattle. The anatomical site and
appearance of the solitary mass embedded in the lung in this case of intrathoracic ectopic
liver were extremely characteristic. Because intrathoracic ectopic liver is also a rare
finding in veterinary medicine, this case report might provide useful information when correct
diagnosis of intrathoracic ectopic liver in cattle is difficult during necropsy or meat
inspection.</p>
