      <abstract>
        <p>Annular placenta is an extremely rare morphological type of human placenta. It is
commonly related to placental vessel abnormalities frequently causing antenatal and
postnatal hemorrhage and operative delivery. Gravida 4 para 1 had an uneventful course of
pregnancy and normal vaginal delivery followed by moderate postpartum hemorrhage.
Hemorrhage was found to be local in origin but the placenta was annular in shape and the
newborn was delivered through one of the openings. Annular placenta was not recognized
before delivery. Its implantation site was in the lower uterine segment but high enough to
allow the passage of the fetus through its annular defect and vaginal birth. To our
knowledge, this is a first report of annular placenta ending in normal vaginal
delivery.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The definitive shape of the placenta is usually determined by the initial distribution of the
villi over the chorionic surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Annular placenta
is a placenta in the form of a band encircling the interior of the uterus. It is very rare but
commonly related to placental vessel abnormalities, frequently causing antenatal and postnatal
hemorrhage and operative delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). In this report,
we describe a case of annular placenta ending in normal vaginal delivery.</p>
    <sec>
      <title>Case</title>
      <p>A 35-year old gravida 4 para 1 was admitted to the labor ward of &#x160;ibenik General
Hospital, &#x160;ibenik, Croatia, in the early stage of labor at 39&#x2009;+&#x2009;3
weeks. She already had one vaginal birth 7 years ago and two early pregnancy losses
(incomplete miscarriage), which both ended with instrumental evacuation of the uterus. The
course of her present pregnancy was uneventful and she received her antenatal care in an
outpatient unit. There was no medical or family history information relevant for her
pregnancy. She had nine antenatal visits and three ultrasound examinations during pregnancy.
All findings were normal and the placental position was reported to be on the posterior
uterine wall.</p>
      <p>On admission, she was well, her blood pressure and pulse rate were within reference ranges,
cardiotocography (CTG) recording was normal and reactive with irregular contractions. Her
uterus was soft, with no pain or tenderness; the baby was in cephalic position and the
head was 4/5 palpable on abdominal examination. On vaginal examination, the cervix was fully
effaced and 4 cm dilated. Through membranes, the fetal head was felt above the level of the
spines. The diagnosis of the latent first stage of labor was made and she was kept on the
labor ward with intermittent cardiotocography (CTG) monitoring, mostly because she lived in
rural area far away from the hospital. There was no intervention in the sense of active
management on the woman&#x2019;s request. She was mobilized and she did not require
analgesia.</p>
      <p>The following morning, the contractions stopped. CTG was normal and reactive. At that time,
she was 8 cm dilated and after having given informed consent she opted for amniotomy and
augmentation of labor. Amniotic fluid was normal and iv. infusion of oxytocine was started
with infusion rate of 0.5 mU/min, increasing in 15-minute intervals until regular
contractions. One hour later she was contracting 1:3 minutes apart with normal reactive CTG.
Two hours after amniotomy, she had an episode of fresh vaginal bleeding. There was no
obvious source, it was not heavy, and was related to cervical dilatation and head
engagement. The bleeding stopped without intervention. CTG was reactive. One hour later she
gave birth to a normal live female newborn weighting 3700 g. The Apgar score after one and 5
minutes was 10.</p>
      <p>Immediately after delivery, she started to bleed heavily. Full blood count and clotting
screen was taken, and the two units were cross-matched to maternal blood. The placenta was
delivered by continuous cord traction and found to be annular with intact membranes on the
one side and with a hole on the other, with torn membranes on its edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Bimanual compression was applied to the uterus,
infusion rate of oxytocin was increased, and ergometrine 0.5 mg was given i.v., followed by
exploration of the uterus and birth canal under general anesthesia. The uterus was found to
be empty and bleeding was located on the cervical tear extending 7 cm and was controlled by
polyglactin sutures. After suturing, the bleeding stopped, a good tonus of the uterus was
obtained, and medio-lateral episiotomy was sutured in a routine manner. She was under close
surveillance in the 4th stage of labor, anemia (Hb value 88 g/L) was corrected with two
units of blood on the second day, and she was discharged home on the day four.</p>

      <p>Following a close inspection, the placenta was found to lack the central part of tissue on
both sides. There was a defect on one side, through which the child passed during the
delivery, with an intact amniotic membrane remaining on the opposite side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The diagnosis of annular placenta was made. The
insertion of the umbilical cord was paracentral.</p>

      <title>Comment</title>
      <p>Annular placenta is likely to be derived from placenta previa with focal atrophy of the
low-lying villous tissue covering the internal os (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).
We believe that multiparity and cervical insufficiency was likely to be one of supporting
factors in this case, as there was a &#x201C;free space&#x201D; above the internal os, where
trophoblastic invasion did not occur. Based on that, annular placenta can be diagnosed by
ultrasound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), which was missed in this case. We
believe that the placenta was correctly visualized on level-one scan, but its presence all
around the uterine cavity was not recognized. Its position was not fulfilling the criteria
of either placenta previa or low-lying placenta (was not within 2 cm of the internal os) and
therefore further investigation was not indicated. What makes our case unusual is that
annular placenta was not diagnosed as placenta previa before the delivery. Ultrasound did
not report placenta previa, on admission there was no placental tissue felt on vaginal
examination, the CTG was normal, the labor was uneventful, the head was engaged, there was
no significant antenatal bleeding, which is commonly present with annular placenta and the
woman was delivered vaginally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Cases of annular placenta have been occasionally reported but the last
report was nearly 20 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). We believe that reason for this is the rising
incidence of cesarean section, in which the placenta is commonly damaged and some
morphological conditions, including annular placenta, cannot be recognized. In this case,
despite annular placenta, vaginal delivery occurred through the placental opening above the
internal os, and annular placenta was recognized after delivery and confirmed on
pathological examination.</p>
