        <p>This report described radiographic and CT features of atypical diffuse idiopathic
skeletal hyperostosis in a 5 year-old, female Shih-tzu showing marked proliferative bone
lesions in the appendicular skeleton with minor spinal changes. Continuous or flowing bony
bridge formation of vertebrae is used as the gold standard for diagnosing diffuse
idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. However, this criterion seems not to be suitable for
appendicular type diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, as in the present case.
Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis is a progressive skeletal disease, and thus,
enthesophytosis and the multiple bony proliferations at insertion sites of ligaments and
tendons to appendicular bones in a lamellar or trabecular pattern were considered
diagnostic features of the appendicular type of diffuse idiopathic skeletal
hyperostosis.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis is a systemic disease affecting the axial and
appendicular skeletons of humans and dogs [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In
particular, several cases involving spinal sites have been reported [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].
In human medicine, three radiographic criteria for differentiating diffuse idiopathic skeletal
hyperostosis from other proliferative spinal diseases, such as spondylosis deformans,
osteochondrosis and ankylosing spondylitis, have been presented. These include: (1) flowing
calcification and ossification along the ventrolateral aspect of at least four continuous
vertebral bodies, with or without localized pointed excrescences at the inventing vertebral
body-intervertebral disc junctions, (2) relative preservation of disc width and the absence of
extensive changes of degenerative disc disease and (3) absence of apophyseal joint ankylosis
and sacroiliac joint erosion, sclerosis or intra-articular fusion [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These criteria are also used as the gold standard for diagnosing
diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis in veterinary medicine. However, the early stages of
diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis cannot be recognized from these criteria, because it
is a progressive disease [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Diffuse idiopathic
skeletal hyperostosis may occur in the appendicular skeleton with minor or absent
abnormalities in the axial skeleton [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore,
these diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis criteria with spinal manifestations have
limitations to fulfill the diagnosis of appendicular diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis.
In this study, we described the diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis with prominent
proliferative change from appendicular bones without typical vertebral lesions and suggested
the diagnostic features for appendicular type of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis.</p>
    <p>A 5 year-old, female Shih-tzu presented with a recurrent generalized dermatologic disorder. A
physical examination revealed keratosis, pyoderma and pigmentation over all of the skin, and
restricted hip motion, with difficulty walking up and down stairs. No significant
abnormalities in the complete blood count, electrolytes or serum chemistry were detected,
including calcium (9.3 mg/d<italic>l</italic>; reference 7.9&#x2013;12.0 mg/d<italic>l</italic>) and
phosphate (4.7 mg/d<italic>l</italic>; reference 2.5&#x2013;6.8 mg/d<italic>l</italic>). The values
of free thyroxine (1.38 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/d<italic>l</italic>; reference 0.6&#x2013;3.7
<italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/d<italic>l</italic>), thyroid stimulated hormone (0.166
<italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic>; reference 0.05&#x2013;0.42
<italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic>) and total thyroxine (1.03
<italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/d<italic>l</italic>; reference 1.0&#x2013;4.0
<italic>&#xB5;</italic>g/d<italic>l</italic>) were within the normal reference ranges.</p>
    <p>Marked new bone formation with a smooth margin was observed over bilateral ilium and ischium
on radiography, and relatively mild bony changes with a similar appearance were observed in
the pubis. A lamellar periosteal reaction, which consisted of a radiolucent inner layer
surrounded with a radiopaque outer layer, was observed along bilateral femurs and tibia. The
outer radiopaque bone had similar bone density as cortical bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Ventrodorsal (A) and right lateral (B) radiographs of the hindlimbs. Proliferative bony
changes with a smooth margin were present over the entire ilium and ischium (white
arrows). Periosteal reaction along the right and left femurs was observed as a laminated
bone pattern that had radiolucent trabecular intensity surrounded by a radiopaque
neocortex (arrowheads).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-493-g001"/></fig>). Additional radiographs to define the extent of the disease revealed bone
proliferation with a smooth margin at the infraglenoid tubercle of the right scapula, surfaces
of bilateral humeri, radii and ulna. In contrast, joints, such as the shoulder, elbow, hip,
stifle, carpus and tarsus, were preserved with no evidence of bone formation. Bone with a
smooth margin had proliferated from the spinous processes of all thoracic and lumbar
vertebrae, the ventral surface of the vertebral body of the second and from the fourth to
seventh lumbar vertebrae and the ribs. Although the ventral surface of vertebrae could not be
definitely evaluated due to superimposition with the transverse processes, there was no
continuous or flowing pattern of proliferative bones and no evidence of bone destruction.
Intervertebral disc width was preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Lateral radiography (A) and sagittal (B) CT image of the lumbar vertebra and transverse
CT images of the second (C) and fourth (D) lumbar vertebrae. Bony proliferation on the
ventral surface of the second and from the fourth to seventh lumbar vertebral bodies was
observed, but was not distinct because of superimposition with the transverse processes
on radiography (black arrowheads). A sagittal CT scan revealed more distinct
proliferative bone formation on the ventral surface of the vertebral body (white
arrowheads). Transverse images show a lamellar pattern with outer hyperdense and inner
hypodense composition (white arrow) or more severe bone proliferation with a remarkable
trabecular bone pattern and formation of neocortex.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-493-g002"/></fig>).</p>
    <p>CT was performed to investigate the extent and severity of bone changes in detail using a 16
channel multi-detector CT scanner (Siemens Emotion 16, Siemens, Forchheim, Germany). Helical
CT scanning was performed from the cervix to the sacrum using 130 kVp and 200 mAs with a 1 mm
slice thickness to acquire the vertebral CT images; from the thoracic and pelvic limbs with
130 kVp, 270 mAs and 1 mm slice thickness for the appendicular skeleton; and from the nostril
to the occipital bones with 110 kVp, 130 mAs and a 1 mm slice thickness for the skull. Then,
multiplanar reconstruction, curvilinear reconstruction and three dimensional volume rendering
reconstruction were carried out. Transverse vertebral CT images showed irregular bone spurs at
the ventral part of the sixth and seventh cervical and from the first to sixth thoracic
vertebrae, and lamellar bone proliferation with outer hyperdense and inner hypodense
composition on the ventral surface from the tenth to the thirteenth thoracic vertebrae and
from the first to third lumbar region. More severe bone proliferation was shown in the ventral
part of the fourth to seventh lumbar vertebrae as a remarkable trabecular bone pattern with
neocortex formation. The distribution and proliferative pattern of new bone were more clearly
described on the reconstructed sagittal plane showing bone formation mainly produced from the
ventral surface of the vertebral body without bridge formation between adjacent vertebrae.
That is, there was no continuous or flowing pattern of new bone between cranial and caudal
vertebrae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2B and 2C</xref>). Thickening of the
spinous processes of thoracic and lumbar vertebrae was observed on the transverse and sagittal
planes. The bone proliferative changes were more marked in most of the appendicular bones as
an irregular and lacy pattern. The origins of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus and
subscapularis muscles had irregular bony proliferation. Bilateral humeri had a relatively mild
periosteal reaction with a lacy and irregular margin. Most parts of the radii showed lacy and
irregular proliferation with the typical lamellar pattern from the distal diaphysis to
epiphysis. Severe bone formation was found in most of the pelvis. In particular, new bone that
proliferated in the iliac crest was thicker than normal bone. Bone formation around the dorsal
sacroiliac ligament with fusion of the sacroiliac joint was detected on dorsal CT images. The
ileal body at the origin of the deep gluteus muscle also showed severe proliferative changes,
and the ischiatic tuberosity, where the sacrotuberous ligament was inserted, had distinct
proliferation. Bilateral coxofemoral joints were preserved. Lamellar or trabecular bone
formation was noted in the distal femur and proximal and distal tibiae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3A&#x2013;3E</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Transverse CT image of appendicular bone including iliac crest inserted into the deep
gluteal muscle; (A), ischiatic tuberosity inserted into the sacrotuberous ligament (B),
right distal femur (C) and right distal tibia; (D, E) attached diverse ligaments and
tendons. Relatively mild lesions show lacy and irregular bony changes (arrowhead). In
addition, more progressive proliferation was noted as a laminated pattern and a
trabecular bone pattern (white arrow).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-493-g003"/></fig>). CT images of the skull demonstrated no remarkable findings.</p>
    <p>Proliferative changes in both the axial and appendicular skeletons except for the digits and
skull were confirmed based on the radiographic and CT examinations. Various diseases,
including hypertrophic osteopathy, osteopetrosis, vitamin A toxicity and thyroid acropachy
were considered in the differential diagnosis. Hypertrophic osteopathy is an osteoproductive
disease, typically commencing on the distal extremities and extending proximally. This disease
is radiographically characterized by a nodular or spiculated patterned periosteal reaction
[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, in this case, bilateral digits had no
evidence of bony proliferation, and the new periosteal bone was in a lamellar or trabecular
bone pattern. Osteopetrosis reveals increased bone opacity in medullary portions with normal
shape and size of bone [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this patient, the
affected bones had relatively hypodense medullary portions, maintaining distinction from the
hyperdense cortical bone. Vitamin A toxicity is one of the reasons for hyperostosis in cats,
whereas it has an opposite effect in dogs and causes bone resorption [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Additionally, thyroid acropachy was ruled out, because the values of
free thyroxine, thyroid stimulated hormone and total thyroxine were within the normal
reference ranges. Consequently, it was difficult to make the initial diagnosis based on the
diagnostic imaging.</p>
    <p>The dog was euthanized at the owner&#x2019;s request in view of the uncertain prognosis and chronic
dermatitis, and a necropsy was performed. New bone formation in the joint margins (osteophyte)
and ligament and tendon insertion sites (enthesophytes) as well as periosteal reactions in
both spinal and extraspinal structures was the most prominent features. Osteophytes and
enthesophytes were arranged into small to sharp finger-like projections in the spinal column
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_004" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Three dimensional volume rendering reconstructed image of the pelvis and bilateral
femur (A, B). A severe periosteal reaction was seen not only in the macerated pelvis (C,
D) but also on the three dimensional volume rendering reconstructed image.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-493-g004"/></fig>). There was thickening of the dorsal spinous processes of vertebrae and irregular rib
shapes. Enthesophytes appeared as mineral deposits around the joint surfaces as well as in the
diaphyseal region of the humeri, radii, ulna, femurs and tibiae. These irregular mineral
deposits varied from pinpoint size to several millimeters in diameter and were more obvious on
the para-articular surfaces of the humeri, tibiae and femurs. Evident fusion of the sacroiliac
joint and the periosteal reaction was seen, and it was more severe in the regions of the ilium
and ischium; this finding was compatible with the three dimensional volume rendered CT images
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4A&#x2013;4D</xref>).</p>
    <p>A histopathologic examination was performed on the right forelimb and right hindlimb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_005">Fig. 5</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_005" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>Histopathologic findings of humerus. A rough and thickened periosteum was observed in
the diaphysis and articular region. Osteoclasts were occassionally seen in the thickened
periosteal are. Along them, osteoblasts were seen in the marginal area between
periosteum and subchondral bone. Enthesophytes were observed, resulting in distinct
separation from the cortical bone. 10X, H&amp;E (A, B). Reactive bones along the margins
of the humerus were merged into the meshwork of bundles of dense collagen framework.
These collagens were arranged randomly and made a dense meshwork parallel to the
articular surface. The deep zonal area showed irregular tidemark, calcified cartilage,
mildly clustered chondrocytes and vascular invasion, indicating osteoarthritis. 100X,
Masson&#x2019;s trichome staining (C). In the joint region, there was infiltration of
lymphocytes and plasma cells as well as hypertrophy of the villi of the synovial
membrane. Alongside of lymphocytic and plasma cells infiltrates was small blood vessels
in the connective tissue. 10X, H&amp;E (D). 100X, Masson&#x2019;s trichome staining (E).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-77-493-g005"/></fig>). Osteoclasts were occasionally seen in the rough and thickened periosteal areas in the
articular regions of the humeri and femurs. Along these osteoclasts, there were osteoblasts in
the marginal area between the periosteum and subchondral bone. New bone formation, such as
enthesophytes, was observed, resulting in distinct separation from cortical bone. Reactive
bone was observed along the margins of the humeral and femoral articular surfaces. Masson&#x2019;s
trichrome staining showed that these marginal areas had merged into a meshwork of dense
collagen bundles. These collagen bundles were arranged randomly and made a dense meshwork
parallel to the articular surface. In addition, the deep zonal area showed an irregular
tidemark, calcified cartilage, mildly clustered chondrocytes and vascular invasion, indicating
osteoarthritis. Based on these results, canine diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis was
diagnosed.</p>
    <p>In our case, intervertebral disc width was preserved without degenerative disc disease. The
apophyseal and sacroiliac joints showed no evidence of ankylosis, erosion or sclerosis that
met criteria (2) and (3). However, the proliferative bone lesion in vertebrae was mild without
continuous or flowing ossification in the ventral region, which is a typical feature of
diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. Furthermore, accurate radiographic evaluation was
difficult, because of superimposition with the surrounding structures, such as transverse
processes.</p>
    <p>The CT examination demonstrated the extent and severity of new bone formation. In particular,
ventral bone formation of vertebrae was determined on the sagittal plane without
superimposition, and there was no continuous bone bridge formation. However, the classical
features of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, including the laminated bone pattern,
consisting of a relative low density area between the ossified deposits and underlying
vertebral body, was observed on transverse CT images. In some regions, such as the fourth to
seventh lumbar vertebrae, more enlarged and thickened ossification, which was observed as a
trabecular bony pattern, was found and was considered the more progressed lesion.</p>
    <p>Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis with appendicular manifestations has been reported
in only two dogs, which were both 4-year-old and large breeds [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Both dogs had a history of
progressive gait abnormalities for the past 1&#x2013;2 years, and they were euthanatized because of
extreme stiffness, pain and lack of a response to treatment [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Long-term radiographic monitoring of
bone lesions was performed in one of them for 26 months [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. On the initial radiography, the periosteal reaction with a mottled appearance
was observed in the proximal region of the right femur, ischium and ilium. Then, progressive
ossification of the right elbow, pelvic, right stifle and tarsal joints occurred. Finally, the
pelvis, femur and caudal lumbar vertebrae were osseously fused to show a trabecular pattern.
Para-articular joint fusion around the elbow and smooth new bone formation in the stifle and
tarsal joints developed progressively with preservation of the joint space itself. These
characteristic radiographic findings were also observed in the other case [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Periarticular new bone and enthesiophytes were present
in the bilateral shoulders and elbows, hip joint and the right stifle joint. However, both
carpal and tarsal joints were normal [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In both cases,
thin section radiography demonstrated a trabecular bone pattern in the neocortex [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The regions
of proliferative changes in appendicular bones of our case were similar to previous reports
[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].
Enthesiophyte, a bone spur at the sites of attachment of tendon and ligament, periarticular
osteophytes and the periosteal reaction were prominently demonstrated with preservation of the
joint surfaces including the shoulder, elbow, hip, stifle, carpus and tarsus. The severity of
new bone formation in this patient was comparatively less than that in the previous cases
showing mineralization of soft tissue with mottled opacity, progressive bony fusion and
flowing ossification along the ventrolateral aspect of at least three continuous vertebral
bodies. The present case did not have bony fusion or muscle mineralization, and proliferative
changes in the vertebral body were not clearly identified on lateral radiographs. Diffuse
idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis was estimated to be at the early stage based on only mild
symptoms in our case.</p>
    <p>The CT examination showed characteristic changes in the appendicular region in detail. The
region of bone proliferation was identified exactly without superimposition using the dorsal
and sagittal images from multiplanar reconstruction as well as the transverse images.
Moreover, three dimensional volume rendering reconstructed images at various angles improved
our understanding of the multiple proliferative lesions. Conspicuous bone proliferation was
noted in regions of attachment to muscles, tendons and ligaments to bone including iliac
crest, ileal body, sacroiliac joint, distal femurs, and proximal and distal tibiae. The
definite features of bone proliferation in the appendicular region were evaluated with CT,
although detailed slab radiography was not performed in this dog. The relatively mild
proliferative lesions showed as lacy and irregular bony changes, and the laminated pattern and
trabecular bone pattern were noted in regions with more severe proliferation.</p>
    <p>This study describes the diagnostic radiography and CT features of canine diffuse idiopathic
skeletal hyperostosis. Continuous flowing bone formation at the ventral region of the
vertebral body has been used as a typical feature of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis.
However, this criterion seems not to be suitable for appendicular type of diffuse idiopathic
skeletal hyperostosis, as in our case, showing marked proliferative bone lesions in the
appendicular skeleton with minor spinal changes. We could not determine whether the
discrepancy in vertebral lesions in this case as compared to the previous cases was related to
the breed, because this case was the first small breed dog with diffuse idiopathic skeletal
hyperostosis. The typical vertebral flowing lesions caused by enthesophytosis and the multiple
bony proliferations at insertion sites of ligaments and tendons to appendicular bones in a
lamellar or trabecular pattern were considered diagnostic features of the appendicular type of
diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis should be
considered in the differential diagnosis when multiple enthesophytosis with a lamellar or
trabecular pattern is observed in vertebrae as well as appendicular bone even in small breed
dogs.</p>
