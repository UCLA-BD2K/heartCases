        <p>Deep <italic>Candida</italic> infections commonly occur in immunosuppressed patients.
A rare case of a multiple deep organ infection with <italic>Candida
albicans</italic>and spinal tuberculosis was reported in a healthy young man. The
19-year-old man complained of month-long fever and lower back pain. He also had a
history of scalded mouth syndrome. Coinfection with <italic>Mycobacterium
tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Candida albicans</italic> was diagnosed using
the culture of aspirates from different regions. Symptoms improved considerably after
antifungal and antituberculous therapy. This case illustrates that infection with
tuberculosis might impair the host's immune system and increase the risk of invasive
candidiasis in an immunocompetent patient.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Invasive candidiasis is a clinical condition that generally occurs in immunosuppressive
patients and those with general defects in the immune system. <italic>Candida
albicans</italic> is the most common fungal pathogen capable of causing infections,
ranging from slight mucocutaneous disorders to invasive diseases which affect multiple
organs<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Deep
<italic>Candida</italic>infections rarely occur in healthy hosts, but the incidence is
greatly increased in immunosuppressive patients. Tuberculosis remains a major global
health problem and has become significantly more prevalent in the past decade. Moreover,
spinal tuberculosis may not display typical symptoms and, sometimes, show predominant
extrapulmonary manifestations that result in delayed or missed diagnosis. Furthermore,
multiple deep organ infections caused by <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and spinal
tuberculosis occurring simultaneously in the same patient are very rare. In view of
this, the following report presents the rare case of multiple deep abscesses caused by
<italic>Candida albicans</italic> with simultaneously occurring spinal tuberculosis
in an immunocompetent patient.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 19-year-old man complained of recurrent fever and lower back pain for a month. He had
a history of scalded mouth syndrome with no regular antibiotic or antifungal drug
treatment six months prior to hospitalization. He had neither history of taking
immunosuppressors, nor of any disease indicative of immunodeficiency. He had, however,
received the Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#xE9;rin (BCG) vaccine during childhood. On admission, his
vital signs included an oral temperature of 39 &#xBA;C, heart rate of 92 beats per minute,
respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg. Physical
examination revealed a 9&#xD7;8cm mass in the right of the patient's neck, but no lesions
were found on the oral mucosa. The remainder of the systemic examination was
unremarkable.</p>
      <p>Laboratory results included a leukocyte count of 14800&#xD7;10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>,
serum glucose level of 143 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 40 mg/dL and creatinine level
of 1.7 mg/dL. Inflammatory markers were elevated with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR) of 120 mm/h and C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 11.1 mg/L. Both a tuberculin
skin test and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody exam were negative.
Comprehensive immunological studies, including serum immunoglobulins and complement
levels, tests for cell-mediated immunity (NK, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD4/CD8 and CD19) and
autoantibody tests, were normal. 1, 3-&#x3B2;-D-glucan assay levels and the galactomannan test
were normal. Blood cultures were also negative. Whole-body positron emission
tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) revealed multiple abscesses in the right of the
patient's neck, liver and right psoas major area respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.1A</xref>); and there was a raised uptake of [<sup>18</sup>F] FDG in
vertebral bodies of T11, T12 and L1. Consequently, percutaneous abscess drainage was
conducted on the upper body using B-mode ultrasonography and drained brown fluids (30
mL, 280 mL and 130 mL, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.1B</xref>) were
sent to the microbiology lab. Also, drainage tubes were inserted into abscesses in the
liver and psoas major, but were removed after no drainage took place. Results of the
Chromagar Candida Medium (Chromagar, France) cultures were positive for <italic>Candida
albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig. 1C</xref>), but no acid-fast
bacilli were detected. The germ tube test was positive and the documented diagnosis
using API 20C Aux systems (BioMeriux, France) was <italic>Candida albicans,</italic>
which was sensitive to amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole,
caspofungin and 5-fluorocytosine. Based on antifungal guidelines and susceptibility
tests, he was treated with intravenous 35 mg amphotericin B daily (0.5 mg/kg per day).
The patient responded to antifungal therapy and his fever abated after ten days of
treatment. Abscess detection using B-mode ultrasonography revealed that the extent of
infection in the upper body had greatly decreased at the end of three-week antifungal
therapy.</p>

      <p>However, there was no improvement in the patient's lower back pain. Spinal magnetic

osteolytic lesions in upper vertebral bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.
2A</xref>). Subsequently, computed tomography (CT) guided percutaneous vertebral
biopsy specimens from the T12 vertebrae revealed caseous material and the acid fast
bacilli were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">C</xref>). Also, the aspirate culture showed growth of the
<italic>M. tuberculosis.</italic> Chest CT, urine and sputum examinations were
normal. Taking histological and microbiological findings into consideration, the patient
was treated with antitubercular therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide,
ethambutol) for 12 months. In addition, he was treated with a total dose of 1500 mg of
amphotericin B, while oral fluconazole and 5-flucytosine were subsequently prescribed
for six months. By his 2-year follow up, there were complete resolutions of the lesions
in the upper vertebral bodies and no evidence of new abscesses.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>
<italic>Candida</italic> is an opportunistic fungal pathogen which generally forms part
of the normal flora of the oropharynx, gastrointestinal tract, and urinary tract in the
healthy human <italic>. Candida albicans</italic> is the most common pathogenic cause of
fungal infections in humans, which can involve multiple organs, including the brain,
mediastinum, kidney, heart, lung, pancreas, liver and peritoneum. Invasive candidiasis
(IC) involves the infection and spread of <italic>Candida</italic> via the bloodstream
and normally affects the immunocompromised or immunodeficient, such as those with
diabetes, neutropenia or burns; people undergoing hemodialysis, abdominal surgery or
total parenteral nutrition; and those undergoing long term therapy with broad-spectrum
antibiotics or corticosteroids<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. The incidence
of IC in the US between 1996 and 2003 was 19-24 infections per 10,000 annual hospital
discharges<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>.</p>
      <p>As one knows, microscopic examination and the cultivation of clinical samples for the
diagnosis of fungal infection are gold-standard methods. Diagnosis of invasive
candidiasis remains difficult and is generally confirmed by the direct microscopic
examination of the fluid drained during percutaneous or surgical abscess drainage.
<italic>Candida</italic> infection in patients is clinically very difficult to
recognize and its diagnosis is frequently missed because of non-specific clinical
features, poor diagnostic yield of traditional microbiological techniques and the
non-specificity of radiological imaging<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. The
results of blood cultures are frequently negative, as was the case for this patient. In
addition, 1, 3-&#x3B2;-D-glucan assay levels and galactomannan tests were normal in this case.
Recently, some studies testified the importance of [<sup>18</sup>F] FDG-PET/CT in
detecting non-central nervous system invasive fungal infection at an early stage and
assessing the efficiency of antifungal therapy<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>.
With the help of whole-body PET/CT scans, the patient's multiple deep abscesses were
found in time. Although the whole-body PET/CT provides a new, more sensitive way of
observing deep organ infections, its high costs mean that it cannot be widely used in
clinical examinations. According to the clinical practice guidelines for the management
of candidiasis by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and antifungal
susceptibility testing, amphotericin B is the current antifungal treatment of
choice<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. The patient responded to antifungal
therapy and the number of abscesses was greatly decreased. In spite of the high death
rates of invasive candidiasis, the patient survived due to the combination of early
diagnosis, percutaneous drainage and antifungal therapy.</p>
      <p>Tuberculosis (TB), a disease more common in immunocompromised persons, is a major global
problem still prevalent in developing countries, despite the availability of highly
effective treatment for decades. China has the second highest level of tuberculosis in
the world, registering 12% of global cases (0.9 million - 1.1 million) in 2012<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Tuberculosis' insidious nature often leads to
delayed or missed diagnosis, sometimes with devastating consequences for the patient. In
this patient, <italic>Candida</italic> spondylitis was initially thought of as the cause
of his back pain, yet it showed no improvement following antifungal treatment. However,
the patient's history of BCG vaccination, negative skin tests and normal chest scans
were not disregarded when considering the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Percutaneous
vertebral biopsy was very useful in confirming diagnosis and could help avoid open
surgical biopsy in future patients. The mainstay in the treatment of spinal tuberculosis
is the conservative management of antituberculous drugs. Surgery is needed only if there
is neurological deficit or spinal instability. In the management of osteoarticular
tuberculosis, chemotherapy including isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide
is recommended for approximately 12 - 18 months<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.
The patient was administered antituberculous treatment with the above four drugs for a
12-month period. At the final 2-year follow-up, the patient was free of symptoms, though
there was little change in the radiological picture except for increased sclerosis at
the margin of the lesion.</p>
      <p>Deep <italic>Candida</italic> infections generally occur in immunosuppressive patients,
especially those who have been treated with immunosuppressors. Recent studies showed
that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> promoted down-modulatory immune mediators to
counteract Th1-type cells and patients' innate immunity, and might have suppressive
effects on the host's immune system<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Also, levels of FoxP3 gene expression and
IL-10 secretion were raised in both pulmonary TB and extra-pulmonary TB<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. The secretion of IL-10 by regulatory T cells can
account for the inhibition of T cell responses and increase the risk of tuberculosis
reactivation<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. A case of coinfection with
<italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Cryptococcus gattii</italic> in a
healthy young woman indicated that infection with TB predisposed to infection with
<italic>Cryptococcus</italic> by down-regulate immune system and altered host
defenses<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. In the case featured in this
report, the patient was immunocompetent and had no history of using immunosuppressive
drugs or having any recent major surgery. It is likely that <italic>Candida
albicans</italic> invaded his bloodstream through impaired oral mucosa membranes and
stuck to the endothelial cells of his blood vessels, in turn transmigrating into the
tissue<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. This indicated that TB infection may
impair the host's immune system and that the spread of <italic>Candida
albicans</italic>maybe ultimately lead to the occurrence of multiple deep organ
infections in the healthy young man.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, multiple deep organ infections with <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and
spinal tuberculosis are rare in healthy young men. Moreover, as it is always difficult
to identify <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, early diagnosis should be considered in
patients with clinical and radiological findings suggesting tuberculosis to avoid
missing diagnosis, particularly in developing countries where tuberculosis is endemic.
Furthermore, the present case report suggests that tuberculosis infection might increase
the risk of invasive candidiasis in patients without significant immunodeficiency. This
hypothesis needs to be confirmed by prospective cohorts with sufficiently large sample
sizes.</p>
