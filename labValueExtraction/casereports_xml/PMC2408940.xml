        <p>The positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) binds with high affinity to &#x3B2;-pleated sheet aggregates of the amyloid-&#x3B2; (A&#x3B2;) peptide <italic>in vitro</italic>. The <italic>in vivo</italic> retention of PiB in brains of people with Alzheimer's disease shows a regional distribution that is very similar to distribution of A&#x3B2; deposits observed post-mortem. However, the basis for regional variations in PiB binding <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the extent to which it binds to different types of A&#x3B2;-containing plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), has not been thoroughly investigated. The present study examined 28 clinically diagnosed and autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease subjects, including one Alzheimer's disease subject who had undergone PiB-PET imaging 10 months prior to death, to evaluate region- and substrate-specific binding of the highly fluorescent PiB derivative 6-CN-PiB. These data were then correlated with region-matched A&#x3B2; plaque load and peptide levels, [<sup>3</sup>H]PiB binding <italic>in vitro</italic>, and <italic>in vivo</italic> PET retention levels. We found that in Alzheimer's disease brain tissue sections, the preponderance of 6-CN-PiB binding is in plaques immunoreactive to either A&#x3B2;42 or A&#x3B2;40, and to vascular A&#x3B2; deposits. 6-CN-PiB labelling was most robust in compact/cored plaques in the prefrontal and temporal cortices. While diffuse plaques, including those in caudate nucleus and presubiculum, were less prominently labelled, amorphous A&#x3B2; plaques in the cerebellum were not detectable with 6-CN-PiB. Only a small subset of NFT were 6-CN-PiB positive; these resembled extracellular &#x2018;ghost&#x2019; NFT. In Alzheimer's disease brain tissue homogenates, there was a direct correlation between [<sup>3</sup>H]PiB binding and insoluble A&#x3B2; peptide levels. In the Alzheimer's disease subject who underwent PiB-PET prior to death, <italic>in vivo</italic> PiB retention levels correlated directly with region-matched post-mortem measures of [<sup>3</sup>H]PiB binding, insoluble A&#x3B2; peptide levels, 6-CN-PiB- and A&#x3B2; plaque load, but not with measures of NFT. These results demonstrate, in a typical Alzheimer's disease brain, that PiB binding is highly selective for insoluble (fibrillar) A&#x3B2; deposits, and not for neurofibrillary pathology. The strong direct correlation of <italic>in vivo</italic> PiB retention with region-matched quantitative analyses of A&#x3B2; plaques in the same subject supports the validity of PiB-PET imaging as a method for <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation of A&#x3B2; plaque burden.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clinically symptomatic Alzheimer's disease can be diagnosed with high accuracy at academic centres (Lopez <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2000<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35"><italic>b</italic></xref>), but diagnosis in the community is less accurate (Pearl, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">1997</xref>). Non-Alzheimer's disease dementia cases are not infrequently misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease (Mayeux <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">1998</xref>), and an emerging issue is the accurate prediction of conversion of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (Gauthier <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2006</xref>). For optimal treatment, it is also critical to identify hallmark Alzheimer's disease pathology as early as possible. This pathology includes &#x3B2;-pleated sheet protein aggregates of amyloid-&#x3B2; (A&#x3B2;) peptides in senile plaques (SP) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) (Khachaturian, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">1985</xref>; Mirra <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">1991</xref>; Consensus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1998</xref>). The development of anti-amyloid therapies (Nicoll <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2006</xref>) further emphasizes the need for a technology to assess treatment efficacy in individual patients. Thus sensitive <italic>in vivo</italic> markers of Alzheimer's disease brain lesions are needed (Consensus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1998</xref>; Klunk, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">1998</xref>; Growdon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">1999</xref>; Morris <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">2005</xref>; Thal <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">2006</xref>).</p><p>Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of amyloid deposits (Klunk <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2004</xref>; Verhoeff <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">2004</xref>; Small <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">2006</xref>) employs blood&#x2013;brain barrier penetrant amyloid-binding compounds such as the thioflavin-T derivative Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) (Klunk <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2004</xref>; Mathis <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2005</xref>). Compared to age-matched, cognitively intact controls, Alzheimer's disease patients have 2- to 3-fold greater PiB retention on PET scans in brain areas known to have high amounts of fibrillar (i.e. Congo red and thioflavin-S labelled) A&#x3B2; plaques in Alzheimer's disease, such as frontal cortex and temporal lobe (Klunk <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2004</xref>; Price <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2005</xref>). Conversely, brain areas relatively unaffected by fibrillar A&#x3B2; pathology, such as the cerebellum, do not have increased PiB retention in Alzheimer's disease subjects. In agreement with these observations <italic>in vivo</italic>, studies of post-mortem Alzheimer's disease brain homogenates show that PiB binds preferentially to A&#x3B2; fibrils (Klunk <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2003<italic>a</italic></xref>), suggesting that PiB imaging could serve as a tool for monitoring changes in A&#x3B2; pathology in Alzheimer's disease. However, the evidence of a direct correlation between <italic>in vivo</italic> PiB-PET retention levels and A&#x3B2; plaques in the same subject is lacking. A recent study of a subject diagnosed with dementia with Lewy bodies, who at autopsy manifested severe vascular A&#x3B2;40 peptide-containing amyloid and infrequent SP, demonstrated that vascular amyloidosis can contribute significantly to PiB-PET signal (Bacskai <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2007</xref>), as did a study of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) (Johnson <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2007</xref>), while Lewy bodies themselves contributed little if at all to overall PiB-PET signal (Fodero-Tavoletti <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2007</xref>). An <italic>in vitro</italic> study, comparing PiB autoradiography signal with A&#x3B2;/amyloid immuno/histology in adjacent autopsy tissue sections, reported a close correspondence of PiB signal with vascular amyloid and A&#x3B2; plaques in Alzheimer's disease, and with NFT in a non-Alzheimer's disease case (Lockhart <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2007</xref>). However, the degree to which PiB binding to A&#x3B2; plaques compared to NFT contributes to <italic>in vivo</italic> recorded PiB retention signal, and the basis for region-specific differences in PiB retention levels in Alzheimer's disease brains <italic>in vivo</italic>, remains to be fully established.</p><p>In the present study we addressed these issues by examining the binding substrates of the highly fluorescent PiB derivative 6-CN-PiB in Alzheimer's disease post-mortem tissues collected from brain regions known to differentially accumulate neuritic and diffuse A&#x3B2; plaques and NFT, and to display differential PiB-PET retention levels <italic>in vivo</italic> (Klunk <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2004</xref>). The physical, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of 6-CN-PiB are very similar to PiB (Mathis <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2003</xref>), but the bright fluorescence of 6-CN-PiB greatly facilitates histochemical studies compared to the more weakly fluorescent parent compound, PiB. These combined histological/immunohistochemical analyses in brain tissue sections were supplemented by quantitative biochemical analyses of [<sup>3</sup>H]PiB binding and A&#x3B2; peptide levels in brain tissue homogenates. We also examined the brain of an Alzheimer's disease subject who underwent PiB-PET imaging 10 months prior to death, to determine the relationship of ante-mortem PiB retention levels (determined by PET) to quantitative measures of 6-CN-PiB and A&#x3B2; labelled plaque load, neurofibrillary pathology, [<sup>3</sup>H]PiB-binding levels and soluble and insoluble A&#x3B2;40 and A&#x3B2;42 peptide levels assessed post-mortem in the same brain regions of this subject. The results of these studies provide new insight into the basis for region-specific patterns of PiB binding <italic>in vivo</italic>, an understanding of which is critical for future evaluation of PiB-PET imaging during the course of Alzheimer's disease, and in the evaluation of effects of anti-amyloid therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Clinical and neuropathological information: autopsy series</title><p>Brain tissues were obtained post-mortem from 27 dementia patients enrolled in the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC). Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia utilized standard criteria (McKhann <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">1984</xref>). Mean Mini Mental Examination Score (MMSE) was 11 &#xB1; 8, mean age was 76 &#xB1; 11 years and mean duration of disease was 7 &#xB1; 4 years. Neuropathological diagnosis of &#x2018;definite Alzheimer's disease&#x2019; was made by the established criteria (Mirra <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">1991</xref>; Consensus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1998</xref>). Fifteen subjects had no other types of brain pathology besides occasional old infarcts; 11 had concomitant &#x3B1;-synuclein-immunoreactive neocortical Lewy bodies (Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease), and one subject had concomitant Parkinson's disease. Superior frontal and medial temporal cortices, parahippocampal gyrus, striatum and cerebellum were dissected at autopsy, immersed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h, cryoprotected in sucrose and sectioned at 40 microns on a freezing sliding microtome. Tissue sections were collected serially in a cryoprotectant solution and stored at &#x2212;20&#xB0;C. Fresh-frozen tissue samples of frontal and occipital cortex grey matter were obtained from six of these Alzheimer's disease brains and were frozen at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C until analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical and neuropathological information: case study</title><p>A 64-year-old female with severe Alzheimer's disease (MMSE = 1 at the time of PiB-PET and MR imaging) was followed clinically in the University of Pittsburgh ADRC for 1 year. Dementia symptoms were first recorded 8 years prior to her death. Her apolipoprotein-E genotype was 3/4. The patient's mother, maternal aunt and uncle all had onset of Alzheimer's disease in their 80s. Her cognitive decline was described by family members as gradually progressive but more rapid in the 18 months prior to her death. At autopsy, the brain weighed 1070 g and upon gross examination was unremarkable except for cortical and hippocampal atrophy and minimal atherosclerosis of the circle of Willis. Multiple brain regions were sampled from the right hemisphere and flash frozen (unfixed) on dry ice for biochemical analyses; the left hemisphere was immersed in 10% formalin for histology.</p></sec><sec><title>PiB-PET and MRI scans and image analyses: case study</title><p>The subject underwent PiB-PET and MR imaging 10 months prior to death. Before the PET imaging session, a spoiled gradient recalled MR scan was obtained for anatomical region-of-interest (ROI) definition. MRI/PET image co-registration was performed using automated methods as previously described (Price <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2005</xref>). PET scanning also was performed as previously described (Lopresti <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2005</xref>); data were acquired using a Siemens/CTI ECAT HR+ scanner (3-dimensional mode, 63 image planes, 15.2 cm axial field of view) following the injection of &#x223C;555 MBq of high-specific activity (&gt;21.4 GBq/&#x3BC;mol) PiB. PET emission data were acquired over 60 min (31 frames: 4 &#xD7; 15 s, 8 &#xD7; 30 s, 9 &#xD7; 60 s, 2 &#xD7; 180 s, 8 &#xD7; 300 s), corrected for attenuation scatter, and radioactive decay, and reconstructed using filtered back-projection. The reconstructed image resolution was &#x223C;6-mm full width at half maximum in the transverse and axial planes. PiB retention levels were determined by the Logan distribution volume ratio (DVR), with the cerebellum as reference region, and were adjusted for partial volume effects (see below) (Lopresti <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2005</xref>). Logan graphical analyses (Logan <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">1996</xref>) were performed for 35&#x2013;60 min (5 points) intervals using input functions derived from cerebellar tissue radioactivity to yield the DVR as the outcome measure (Lammertsma and Hume, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">1996</xref>). The DVR is a unitless value related directly to the free binding-site pool (<italic>B</italic><sub>max</sub>) and the ligand dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) (Mintun <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">1984</xref>), and is a measure of region-specific PiB retention (Lopresti <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic>&#x2013;<italic>in vitro</italic> correlation analyses: case study</title><p>From the left (formalin fixed) hemisphere, a 1-cm thick axial tissue slab was dissected by making a cut along the AC-PC plane (i.e. along a plane through the anterior and posterior commissures), and a second cut parallel and 1 cm dorsal to the AC-PC plane. This plane of section allowed for sampling from multiple cortical and subcortical regions known to be differentially affected with A&#x3B2; and NFT pathology, and also allowed for precise sampling of a matching clinical imaging plane. From this 1-cm thick axial tissue slab, 25 tissue cubes were chosen to sample the entire cortical ribbon and most of the subcortical nuclei present at this brain level (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). All tissue cubes were &#x223C;1 &#xD7; 1 cm except cube #25 (hippocampus: 0.5 &#xD7; 0.5 cm) and cube #19 (occipital pole: polygon) that were adjusted to fit their respective anatomical boundaries in this axial plane of section. The 25 tissue cubes were dissected, cryoprotected (as described subsequently) and sectioned serially at 40 &#xB5;m. Alternate sections were then divided into two sets. Selected tissue sections from one set were processed for histochemical staining with 6-CN-PiB, thioflavin-S (Thio-S) and X-34 compounds, and for immunohistochemistry (IHC) with anti-A&#x3B2; and anti-tau antibodies as described below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). All of the alternate tissue sections from each cube were combined and homogenized for the [<sup>3</sup>H]PiB-binding assay (see below).</p><p>Co-registered MRI and PiB-PET images of the left hemisphere were oriented along the axial AC-PC plane. Guided by anatomical landmarks on the ventral surface (i.e. the AC-PC plane) of the tissue slab, the 25 ROIs were drawn in the AC-PC plane of the MRI. Except for the slight adjustments necessary due to post-mortem collapse of the ventricles, all ROIs on the MRI scan matched the tissue cubes taken from the autopsy tissue slab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). These ROIs were then copied onto three additional MRI planes superior to the AC-PC plane for a total of four adjacent 0.24-cm planes, to produce 25 volumes-of-interest (VOIs). The VOIs were all 1 &#xD7; 1 &#xD7; 1 cm except VOI #25 (caudal portion of the hippocampus; 0.5 &#xD7; 0.5 &#xD7; 1 cm) and the polygonal VOI #19 (occipital pole). To minimize inclusion of CSF space in the hippocampal VOI, ROI #25 was moved slightly from plane to plane. The entire set of 25 VOIs was then transferred from the MRI scan onto the co-registered PiB-PET scan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>Histochemically assessed 6-CN-PiB plaque load was calculated as percent area, and biochemical [<sup>3</sup>H]PiB binding and ELISA A&#x3B2; levels were calculated as picomoles per gram of tissue wet weight. Both of these post-mortem measures inherently corrected for (i.e. exclude) any partial volume effects by focusing only on tissue and excluding any contribution from CSF spaces. Therefore, the <italic>in vivo</italic> PiB-PET DVR values also were adjusted for partial volume effects by the use of a 2-component MRI-based partial-volume correction to adjust for the dilutional effect of expanded cerebrospinal fluid spaces (Meltzer <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">1999</xref>; Lopresti <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2005</xref>). Because the placement of six of the VOI (i.e. 10&#x2013;13, 15 and 24) resulted in &lt; 70% tissue in the VOI, and this could result in artefactually high corrected DVR values, only those VOI with &gt; 70% tissue (<italic>n</italic> = 19) were included in our analyses.</p><p>From the right hemisphere, fresh (unfixed) tissue samples were dissected from 14 regions: superior (BA9) and middle (BA46) frontal cortex, frontal pole (BA10), occipital cortex (BA18), superior (BA41), middle (BA22) and inferior (BA21) temporal cortex, inferior parietal cortex (BA40), cingulate gyrus (BA31), caudate nucleus, subiculum/entorhinal cortex, Ammon's horn, subcortical white matter and cerebellum. It should be noted that these frozen tissue samples from right hemisphere did not correspond exactly to the 25 tissue cubes dissected from the formalin-fixed (left hemisphere) slab at the AC-PC level, but were contained within the standard VOI set routinely sampled in our <italic>in vivo</italic> PiB-PET studies (Price <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2005</xref>). Frozen tissue samples were homogenized (150 mg/ml) in a tissue homogenization buffer [250 mM sucrose, 20 mM Tris base and protease inhibitors (Sigma #8340 protease inhibitor cocktail; 10 &#x3BC;l per millilitre buffer)] using a glass vessel and piston-type Teflon pestle. An aliquot of the 150 mg/ml homogenate was used for the A&#x3B2; ELISA; another aliquot was diluted to 10 mg tissue/ml with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for the [<sup>3</sup>H]PiB-binding assay (see below). For correlation analyses of these post-mortem biochemical assays and <italic>in vivo</italic> PiB-PET retention levels, these 14 areas were mapped onto corresponding VOIs drawn on the MR image (performed on the same day as the PiB-PET study) of the same hemisphere. VOIs were then transferred to the corresponding PiB-PET image for calculation of the DVR values (as described earlier), and the values correlated with the results of A&#x3B2; ELISA and [<sup>3</sup>H]PiB-binding analyses (as below).</p></sec><sec><title>6-CN-PiB, X-34 and Thio-S histofluorescence</title><p>Tissue sections were slide mounted and processed for attenuation of lipofuscin autofluorescence (Guntern <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">1992</xref>). 6-CN-PiB was used at concentrations of 100 nM, 1 &#xB5;M, 10 &#xB5;M and 100 &#xB5;M.

The validity of this procedure was confirmed in an additional set of tissue sections that were either double immunolabelled with a monoclonal antibody to detect A&#x3B2; (10D5) and a polyclonal antiserum to detect tau (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), or single-labelled with tau, and then counterstained with 6-CN-PiB. Tau IHC was performed as above, except that alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the Vector Blue substrate were used, and sections were pre-treated with levamisole (Vector) to prevent endogenous phosphatase activity. This procedure distinguished neuritic (10D5-immunoreactive plaques with tau- immunoreactive dystrophic neurites) and non-neuritic (10D5- immunoreactive plaques lacking tau- immunoreactive neurites) plaques. 6-CN-PiB counterstaining of IHC-processed sections followed removal of the chromogen using the tissue autofluorescence quenching procedure (Guntern <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">1992</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> [<sup>3</sup>H]PiB-binding assay</title><p>Formalin-fixed tissue samples were homogenized with a Polytron tissue homogenizer (PT 10/35, Brinkman Instruments Inc., Westbury, NY) at room temperature for 30 s at setting 6 in PBS (137 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate; pH 7.0) at a concentration of 10 mg brain/ml. Fresh-frozen tissue homogenates were diluted from 150 mg/ml in tissue homogenization buffer (see above) to 10 mg/ml with PBS and then re-homogenized with the PT 10/35 as described earlier. The homogenates were aliquoted and frozen at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C until used (within 2 months) for binding assays. No significant changes in binding characteristics were observed in samples assayed repeatedly over this time period. Unlabelled PiB was dissolved in DMSO at 400 &#x3BC;M (to yield &lt;1% DMSO in the final assay). This stock solution was diluted with PBS to achieve the desired concentration in the final assay. For determination of [<sup>3</sup>H]PiB binding in homogenates of Alzheimer's disease brains, 1 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]PiB (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO; specific activity 72.4 Ci/mmol) was incubated with 100 &#xB5;g tissue in 1 ml PBS. Non-specific binding was defined as the number of counts remaining in the presence of 1 &#x3BC;M unlabelled PiB. The binding mixtures were filtered through a Whatman GF/B glass filter using a Brandel M-24R cell harvester (Gaithersburg, MD) and rapidly washed five times with 3 ml PBS. The filters were counted in Cytoscint-ES after thorough vortexing and resting overnight. Results were corrected for non-specific, non-displaceable binding in the presence of 1 &#xB5;M PiB and expressed as picomoles [<sup>3</sup>H]PiB bound per gram of wet tissue weight in the homogenate.

Our study of an Alzheimer's disease subject who underwent post-mortem neuropathological examination 10 months after <italic>in vivo</italic> PiB-PET imaging, demonstrated that <italic>in vivo</italic> PiB retention correlated directly with region-matched post-mortem quantification of 6-CN-PiB and A&#x3B2; plaque load, PiB binding and A&#x3B2; peptide levels, but not NFT or other neurofibrillary pathology. Although the PiB-PET study and autopsy were separated by 10 months, Engler <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2006</xref>) have shown that PiB-PET DVR values do not change appreciably over 2 years in patients with Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>The close co-localization of 6-CN-PiB labelling with A&#x3B2;40 and A&#x3B2;42 immunoreactive plaques, and the <italic>in vitro</italic> binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]PiB to synthetic fibrils made from either A&#x3B2;<sub>1&#x2013;40</sub> or A&#x3B2;<sub>1&#x2013;42</sub>, indicate that PiB binds similarly to these two forms of A&#x3B2;, once they have adopted a &#x3B2;-sheet fibrillar structure. A&#x3B2;42-containing plaques and A&#x3B2;42 peptide levels are much more abundant in Alzheimer's disease brain (Iwatsubo <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">1994</xref>; Naslund <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">2000</xref>), and therefore likely drive the correlation between PiB and total A&#x3B2; peptide (A&#x3B2;42 and A&#x3B2;40 combined) levels as determined in our ELISA assays. Thus, the majority of <italic>in vivo</italic> PiB retention on PET scans in Alzheimer's disease reflects aggregated A&#x3B2;42 deposits. We did not explore the effect of the A&#x3B2; N-terminal heterogeneity on PiB binding, but a recent paper examining PiB binding to brain tissue from transgenic mouse models of amyloid deposition suggested that the form of A&#x3B2; starting with cyclized glutamate in the 3-position [i.e. pyroglutamate or N3(pE) form] is a major contributor to PiB binding (Maeda <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2007</xref>). This is of interest given the previously reported findings that the N3(pE) form of A&#x3B2; comprises 25&#x2013;50% of total A&#x3B2; (Harigaya <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2000</xref>; Russo <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2002</xref>).</p><p>The requirement that A&#x3B2; be in fibrillar form for PiB binding was verified both by the demonstration that formic acid pre-treatment of tissue sections (which disrupts the &#x3B2;-sheet fibrillar structure) abolished 6-CN-PiB binding to plaques and vascular amyloid, and by the direct correlation of <italic>in vitro</italic> PiB binding with insoluble (formic acid extracted) A&#x3B2; which forms amyloid plaques, but not with soluble A&#x3B2;. The intensity of 6-CN-PiB plaque labelling reflected the density of A&#x3B2; immunoreactive fibrils in plaques, from lightly labelled diffuse plaques to intensely fluorescent compact/cored plaques.</p><p>The only region that lacked the close correlation between 6-CN-PiB fluorescence labelling and A&#x3B2; immunoreactivity in plaques was the cerebellum. The rare, small compact plaques in the Purkinje and granular layers, and infrequent CAA were labelled by 6-CN-PiB. However, fleecy appearing diffuse plaques in the molecular layer (the vast majority of A&#x3B2; immunoreactive and X-34 positive plaques in the cerebellum) were not detectable with 6-CN-PiB. This is consistent with the observation that <italic>in vivo</italic> PiB retention levels in Alzheimer's disease brain are consistently lowest in the cerebellum, and further justifies using the cerebellum as a reference region when quantifying regional <italic>in vivo</italic> PiB retention levels (Lopresti <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2005</xref>).</p><p>The binding of PiB to diffuse plaques in the striatum and other regions examined, but not in the cerebellum, is likely due to the unique secondary structure and amino acid composition of cerebellar diffuse A&#x3B2; aggregates (Lalowski <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">1996</xref>). Furthermore, unlike the occasional small compact plaques that were 6-CN-PiB positive, cerebellar diffuse plaques contain few amyloid fibrils characteristic of plaque cores (Verga <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">1989</xref>). The intense 6-CN-PiB labelling of all compact cored plaques, the weaker labelling of diffuse cortical, striatal and hippocampal plaques, and the complete absence of labelling in cerebellar fleecy amyloid may be due to higher amyloid fibril density in the compact cored plaques. 6-CN-PiB did not label dystrophic neurites, indicating that plaque-associated neuritic elements do not likely contribute to overall PiB signal, despite the robust labelling of these structures with other amyloid-binding compounds such as X-34. Because PiB can detect diffuse plaques in addition to cored and neuritic plaques, PiB-PET imaging may be useful for detection of early amyloid deposition. PiB-PET is able to track A&#x3B2; deposition across the spectrum of normal aging to advanced Alzheimer's disease (Forsberg <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2007</xref>; Kemppainen <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2007</xref>; Rowe <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">2007</xref>), and further histological studies will need to be performed to assess the relative contributions of different plaque types across this spectrum. Compact A&#x3B2; plaques are likely associated with increased presence of reactive glial cells. It will be important to examine correlations of PiB binding with microglial and astrocytic activation, as well as additional cellular and molecular alterations, in future studies.</p><p>In contrast to the strong correlation between 6-CN-PiB staining and A&#x3B2; plaques, 6-CN-PiB did not bind at detectable levels to significant numbers of NFT, even in the ERC layer II cell islands where tau-immunoreactive and X-34 fluorescent NFT were abundant. This is consistent with the previously reported observation in elderly healthy control brain of a lack of [<sup>3</sup>H]PiB binding to homogenates of transentorhinal cortex (Klunk <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2003<italic>b</italic></xref>), a brain area that is the first to show NFT pathology (Braak and Braak, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">1991<italic>a</italic></xref>). These observations differ somewhat from those of Lockhart <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2007</xref>), who reported overlap between NFT-labelling and PiB autoradiography in the ERC. The finding by Lockhart <italic>et al</italic>. could be the result of long autoradiography exposure time (7 weeks) wherein even the weakest signal can be amplified, or it could be due to misidentification of structures due to the low resolution of film autoradiography, as well as comparison of different tissue sections (as opposed to multiple labelling on single tissue section). In the present study, we did observe weak PiB labelling of a relatively small subset of NFT, mostly extracellular NFT detectable in the ERC layer II and subiculum/CA1, while the majority of intracellular NFT were not detectable. This pattern was confirmed by additional histological experiments using another fluorescent PiB derivative, BTA-1 (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/awn016/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 2</ext-link>). In the ERC lamina II, the bulk of NFT were BTA-1 negative, while small-diameter plaques were BTA-1 positive. This distinction would not have been detected by the autoradiographic approach used by Lockhart <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2007</xref>). Furthermore, in the Lockhart <italic>et al</italic>. study (Lockhart <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2007</xref>), some N-terminus A&#x3B2; truncated diffuse A&#x3B2; plaques in the ERC could have gone undetected by the N-terminus A&#x3B2; IHC and thioflavin-S histochemistry. Since select NFT, and particularly extracellular NFT, contain epitopes recognized by A&#x3B2; antibodies (Masters <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">1985</xref>; Grundke-Iqbal <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">1989</xref>; Hyman <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">1989</xref>; Spillantini <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">1990</xref>; Tabaton <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">1991</xref>; Perry <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">1993</xref>), we must also consider the possibility that the NFT labelled by 6-CN-PiB and BTA-1 represent NFT-associated A&#x3B2; peptides that fibrilized once the NFT became extracellular (Grundke-Iqbal <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">1989</xref>). Thus, even the occasional labelling of extracellular NFT observed in this study may be due to the presence of A&#x3B2; fibrils, rather than the presence of high-affinity binding sites on tau-formed amyloid (Lockhart <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2007</xref>). Alternatively, extracellular proteolysis of tau in extracellular NFT may expose the protease-resistant core of PHF, or change its structure (Mena <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">1996</xref>) making it accessible to PiB. Regardless, the binding of PiB to a subset of NFT produces weak signal relative to that generated by PiB-bound A&#x3B2; plaques, and does not likely contribute significantly to tracer uptake and PiB-PET signal <italic>in vivo</italic>. This is supported by the fact that <italic>in vivo</italic> PiB-PET imaging studies consistently demonstrated very little signal in mesial temporal lobe, despite the high NFT load detected both histologically and immunohistochemically in this region (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). It should also be noted that the presence of the cell membrane is not likely the determining factor for PiB labelling differences between intracellular and extracellular NFT because: (i) the cell membrane is not likely to be intact in the histological sections; and (ii) PiB has to cross several membranes which comprise the blood&#x2013;brain barrier in order to access either plaques or NFT <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In this study, the strong labelling of CAA (when present) by 6-CN-PiB was of similar intensity to compact plaques, but the frequency of CAA in the typical Alzheimer's disease brains we examined was much lower than that of plaques. Thus in most Alzheimer's disease subjects, PiB binding to CAA contributes relatively little to the total <italic>in vivo</italic> signal, which appears to be driven primarily by A&#x3B2;-containing amyloid plaques. In subjects with amyloid angiopathy (Johnson <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2007</xref>) CAA could be a major contribution to the <italic>in vivo</italic> PiB signal. However, CAA pathology has an occipital predilection, resulting in a greater occipital-to-global PiB ratio compared to Alzheimer's disease patients (Johnson <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2007</xref>). This underscores the need to interpret the PiB-PET imaging relative to the known occurrence of neuropathological lesions in the brain areas under investigation.</p><p>Until recently, it was not possible to establish a direct relationship between PiB retention <italic>in vivo</italic> and A&#x3B2; pathology in the same subject. In a case of pathologically confirmed dementia with Lewy bodies and severe CAA (Bacskai <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2007</xref>), ante-mortem PiB retention levels correlated with post-mortem biochemical measures of A&#x3B2; and PiB binding in three brain regions. PiB binding in this case was primarily associated with vascular A&#x3B2; deposits due to the CAA, while A&#x3B2; plaques were scarce. This made it difficult to directly correlate <italic>in vivo</italic> PiB retention with A&#x3B2; plaque deposits in that case, and no correlation was attempted with histological or immunohistochemical A&#x3B2; load. Nevertheless, the results of that study suggested a correlation between <italic>in vivo</italic> PiB measures with A&#x3B2; amyloid load, and thus are in accord with the present study, which clearly demonstrates that <italic>in vivo</italic> PiB retention in a pathologically typical Alzheimer's disease patient is related directly to the amount of insoluble A&#x3B2; peptides, including A&#x3B2; plaques.</p><p>Our results underscore the validity of using PiB-PET scanning not only to detect and follow the progression of A&#x3B2;-containing fibrillar amyloid deposits in clinically defined subject populations, but also to assess effectiveness of therapies aimed at clearing these potentially toxic deposits from the brain.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/awn016/DC1">Supplementary material</ext-link> is available at <italic>Brain</italic> online.</p></sec>
