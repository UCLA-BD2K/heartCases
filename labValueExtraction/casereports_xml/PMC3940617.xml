          <title>Background</title>
          <p>The gene for New Delhi metallo-&#x3B2;-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) has been reported to be transmitted via plasmids which are easily transferable and capable of wide distribution. We report the isolation of two NDM-1 producing strains and possible <italic>in vivo</italic> transfer of <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> in a patient.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Clinical samples were collected for bacterial culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing from a patient during a 34-day hospitalization. The presence of <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> was detected by PCR and sequencing. Plasmids of interest were sequenced. Medical records were reviewed for evidence of association between the administration of antibiotics and the acquisition of the NDM-1 resistance.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>A NDM-1 positive <italic>Raoultella planticola</italic> was isolated from blood on the ninth day of hospitalization without administration of any carbapenem antibiotics and a NDM-1 positive <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was isolated from feces on the 29<sup>th</sup> day of hospitalization and eight days after imipenem administration. The <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> was carried by a 280 kb plasmid pRpNDM1-1 in <italic>R. planticola</italic> and a 58 kb plasmid pEcNDM1-4 in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The two plasmids shared a 4812 bp NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element which was found to be excisable from the plasmid as a free form and transferrable in vitro to a NDM-1 negative plasmid from <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p><italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> was embedded in an IS<italic>CR1</italic> complex class 1 integron as a novel 4812 bp NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element. The element was found to be able to self excise to become a free form, which may provide a new vehicle for NDM-1 dissemination. This mechanism could greatly accelerate the spread of NDM-1 mediated broad spectrum &#x3B2;-lactam resistance.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Carbapenems often represent last-resource drugs for Gram negative bacterial infections. The most common mechanism of carbapenem resistance in Gram negative bacteria is the production of carbapenemases, including metallo-&#x3B2;-lactamases (MBLs). The New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1), a recently identified novel type of MBL can hydrolyze virtually all &#x3B2;-lactams, adding further burden to an already high level of antibiotic resistance. The emergence and global spread of NDM-1 mediated broad spectrum &#x3B2;-lactam resistance has become a major concern worldwide <xref rid="pone.0089893-Shahid1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089893-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>NDM-1 was first identified in a carbapenem-resistant <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> strain isolated from urine and an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain isolated from feces of the same patient that was resistant to almost all antibiotics tested except colistin and tigecycline in 2009 in Sweden <xref rid="pone.0089893-Yong1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. NDM-1 positive <italic>K. pneuomoniae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> were soon detected in many other countries, including Australia, Canada, Germany, China, France, Japan, the Nordic countries, United States and many others <xref rid="pone.0089893-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0089893-Sole1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In addition, reported NDM-1 positive bacterial species extended to <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> spp, <italic>Citrobacter freundii</italic>, <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic>, <italic>Morganella morganii</italic>, <italic>Providencia</italic> spp, and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0089893-Kumarasamy1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0089893-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The world has been alarmed by the wide dissemination of NDM-1 isolates, for which new and effective antibiotics are currently unavailable. The gene <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> encoding NDM-1 has been mostly reported to be on plasmids, which could rapidly disseminate and spread between different bacterial species by cell-to-cell transfer of the plasmids. However the plasmids carrying <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> are different in sizes, ranging from 40 kb to 400 kb <xref rid="pone.0089893-Kumarasamy1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, suggesting that direct transfer by plasmid is only one means of NDM-1 dissemination. Multiple mobile genetic elements are also associated with <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> dissemination <xref rid="pone.0089893-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089893-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089893-Sekizuka1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The insertion sequence common region 1 (IS<italic>CR1</italic>) is a well recognized system of gene capture. Its role in antibiotic resistance dissemination was first noted by the evidence that a wide variety of antimicrobial determinants are found in the immediate vicinity of IS<italic>CR1</italic>

        <p>The patient was a 51-year-old farmer from a small village of Gansu Province, who has never visited any cities in China or other countries that have reported NDM-1. On October 1, 2010, the patient was admitted to Lanzhou medical school hospital because of severe multiple left rib fractures as a result of traffic accident. Surgical operation was performed three hours after the accident. A second operation was performed five days later on the 6<sup>th</sup> of October. The patient was hospitalized for 34 days and discharged on November 6, 2010. The blood, urine, sputum and feces were sampled for isolation of bacteria and antibiotic susceptibility testing as standard patient care except that some samples also were collected for the investigation of NDM-1.</p>

Most of the Roche and Illumina reads were assembled into 252 contigs and 23 scaffolds. Gaps were closed and genome structure confirmed by targeted PCR and Sanger sequencing. The chromosome and the two plasmids of RpNDM1 were completely assembled. The <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> carrying plasmid pRpNDM1-1 was 277 682 bp in size and belongs to the IncH group by sequence homology analysis <xref rid="pone.0089893-Villa1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089893-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The plasmid encodes 261 coding sequences (CDSs), of which 136 encode proteins with homology to proteins of known functions and the remaining 125 (47.9%) encode hypothetical proteins.

        <p>pRpNDM1-1 was found to share 86% of its sequence by length with <italic>Klebsiella oxytoca</italic> strain E718 plasmid pKOX-R1 (GenBank accession number CP003684), showing three segments of co-linearity, although genetic arrangement of the segments was slightly different (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0089893.s001">Figure S2 in File S1</xref>). In comparison to pKOX-R1, pRpNDM1-1 carries an additional 32 395 bp antibiotic resistance region, starting from downstream of IS26 at position bp 177 631 to upstream of class 1 integron 5&#x2032;CS at position bp 21 0027, carrying 7 antibiotic resistance genes including <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub>. Interestingly, <italic>Klebsiella oxytoca</italic> strain E718, a NDM-1 carrying strain, isolated from Taiwan harbored another plasmid, pKOX_NDM1 in addition to pKOX-R1. The <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> was found to be located on pKOX_NDM1, which had little similarity with pRpNDM1-1 except for a 100% identical segment of 1294 bp carrying 5&#x2032;-IS<italic>Aba125</italic>-<italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub>-<italic>ble</italic><sub>MBL</sub>-3&#x2032;, which indicates that the NDM-1 acquisition by plasmid pRpNDM1-1 has a complex history (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0089893.s001">Figure S2 in File S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>The plasmid pEcNDM1-4 was sequenced using the EZ-Tn5 transposition system. The genetic structure and the sequence of the plasmid were further confirmed by PCR and sequencing of the PCR products using 19 pairs of overlapping primers. The plasmid was 58 228 bp and was found to share a backbone of approximately 51 kb with plasmid pKp96 <xref rid="pone.0089893-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> at 99% DNA sequence identity including the complete array of genes for replication, plasmid transfer, partition and stabilization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0089893.s001">Figure S1 in File S1</xref>). The backbone of pEcNDM1-4 was interspersed by four insertions. Insertion-1 (bp 4384 to bp 7924) was comprised of <italic>bla</italic><sub>OXA-30</sub> (resistance to lactam antibiotics), <italic>catB3</italic> (resistance to chlorophenical), a truncated <italic>arr3</italic> and a truncated <italic>dfrA27</italic>. The truncated <italic>dfrA27</italic> is unusual as it contained a 113 bp deletion in the middle of the gene and is identical to that found in plasmid pRpNDM1-1. Insertion-2 (bp 11 394 to bp 16 257) was comprised of a truncated <italic>ble</italic><sub>MBL</sub>(resistance to bleomycin), <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub>, a truncated IS<italic>Aba125</italic>, a truncated <italic>qacE1/sul1</italic> and an intact IS<italic>CR1</italic>. Insertion-3 (bp 17 091 to bp 17 909) was comprised of a mobile element IS26. Insertion-4 (bp 35 885 to bp 36 170) was comprised of a partial <italic>fipA</italic> encoding a fertility inhibition protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0089893.s001">Figure S1 in File S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>The plasmid pEcNDMneg-4 was sequenced by targeted PCR sequencing using the 19 pairs of primers that were used to confirm the genetic structure of pEcNDM1-4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0089893.s001">Table S1 in File S1</xref>). Except for 2 pairs of primers, 17 pairs of the primers successfully amplified products and the sequences obtained from sequencing the PCR products were identical to that of pEcNDM1-4. We found that pEcNDMneg-4 was completely co-linear and identical to pEcNDM1-4 except for the region where the 2 pairs of primers failed. The gap was closed using new primers and the plasmid pEcNDMneg-4 was 53 416 bp and was 100% identical to plasmid pEcNDM1-4 except for a 4812 bp deletion which contained a truncated <italic>ble</italic><sub>MBL</sub>, <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub>, a truncated IS<italic>Aba125</italic>, the class 1 integron 3&#x2032;CS (<italic>qacE1/sul1</italic>) and an IS<italic>CR1</italic> element.

        <title>The discovery and characterization of the 4812 bp NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element</title>
        <p>When the plasmid DNA extracted from JM109 (pEcNDM1-4) was probed with the <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> probe, a 5 kb band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089893-g002">Figure 2f</xref>, labelled b) hybridized with the <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> probe at low intensity although this band cannot be seen on the agarose gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089893-g002">Figure 2e</xref>), in addition to the heavy smear band that corresponds to the <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> carrying 58 kb plasmid. The 5 kb band was unexpected, suggesting that a free form of a 5 kb DNA molecule carrying <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> exists in the cell.</p>
        <p>Using primer pair C4-F and C5-R designed to amplify the sequence between <italic>arr3</italic> and <italic>qnrA3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089893-g002">Figure 2a</xref>), two fragments of approximately 5 kb and 10 kb were amplified from pEcNDM1-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089893-g002">Figure 2g</xref>, Lane 1) and one fragment of approximately 5 kb was amplified from pEcNDMneg-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089893-g002">Figure 2g</xref>, Lane 2). The latter was much more intense, although similar amounts of templates were used for the 2 PCR amplifications. Cloning and sequencing of the 5 kb and 10 kb agarose gel purified fragments from the pEcNDM1-4 PCR amplification revealed that the 10 kb fragment corresponds to the region between <italic>arr3</italic> to <italic>qnrA3</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089893-g002">Figure 2a</xref>) and the 5 kb fragment corresponds to the same region but is devoid of the 4812 bp NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element. We also sequenced the 5 kb PCR product from pEcNDMneg-4. The sequences of the two 5 kb fragments were 100% identical. These results suggest that the 4812 bp NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element can be excised from the plasmid. The 5 kb band observed in the Southern hybridization of undigested plasmid DNA extract described above must be the 4812 bp NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element, providing further evidence of the existence of a free form of the 4812 bp NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element.</p>
        <p>Four pairs of primers, L1F/R to L4F/R, facing diverging directions were designed to confirm the structure of the 4812 bp NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element. An approximately 5 kb fragment was amplified from EcNDM1 using each of the four pairs of primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089893-g002">Figure 2g</xref>). Sequencing of these PCR products showed that they all corresponded to the 4812 bp NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element, albeit the sequences started from different positions as the primers anneal at different sites. These PCR experiments confirmed the presence of the 4812 bp NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element. However the PCR results cannot determine whether the NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element is in a circular form or in tandem multiple copies since the diverging primer pairs can amplify a product in both scenarios.</p>
        <p>We then used restriction mapping to determine whether there is more than one copy of the NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element on the plasmid. There is a <italic>Not</italic>I site at bp 12 238 located in the 4812 bp NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element and a <italic>Not</italic>I site upstream at bp 2218 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089893-g002">Figure 2a</xref>). When the plasmid pEcNDM1-4 was digested by <italic>Not</italic>I and probed with the <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> probe, a 10 kb hybridization band was observed as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089893-g002">Figure 2e and 2f</xref>). A 5 kb hybridization band was also observed and was approximately double of the intensity of the 10 kb hybridization band, suggesting that there were double copies of the 5 kb band relative to the 10 kb band. We then used 2 more restriction enzymes, <italic>Cla</italic>I and <italic>Bsa</italic>XI, to further determine whether there is a single copy or multiple copies of the NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element. The <italic>Cla</italic>I (restriction sites flanking the <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> gene at bp 4619 and bp 18 518) and <italic>Bsa</italic>XI (restriction sites flanking the <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> gene at bp 6738 and bp 16 939) digestions were expected to generate 13 kb and 10 kb fragments respectively. However when plasmid pEcNDM1-4 was digested by <italic>Cla</italic>I and <italic>Bsa</italic>XI and probed with the <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> probe, a 23 kb band and a 20 kb band were hybridized with the <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> probe respectively, which is 10 kb larger than expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089893-g002">Figure 2f</xref>). The extra 10 kb indicates that there are 2 more copies of the NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element present in tandem. However this result is inconsistent with the C4-F/C5-R PCR results which only detected a 5 kb and a 10 kb band corresponding to 0 or 1 copy of the NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element. The discrepancy can be explained by that the C4-F/C5-R PCR failed to amplify the 20 kb amplicon that contains 3 copies of the NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element because of the length limit of the PCR amplification. This also explains the large difference in band intensity observed between pEcNDM1-4 and pEcNDMneg-4 in the C4-F/C5-R PCR described above. There must be a very small proportion of the pEcNDM1-4 carrying 0 or 1 copy of the NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element with the majority carrying 3 copies. Therefore the pEcNDM1-4 size is expected to vary from 53 416 kb (0 copy of the NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element) to 67 852 kb (3 copies of the NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element), which may also partly explain the smear observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089893-g002">Figure 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089893-g002">Figure 2f</xref> of the total plasmid extract. Note that the assembled pEcNDM1-4 sequence has only one copy of the NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element with a size of 58 228 bp, due to the limitation of sequence assembly that cannot resolve the repeats.</p>
        <p>Considering all of the results above, the 4812 bp NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element exists in two forms in EcNDM1 as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089893-g002">Figure 2a</xref>. One was located on the plasmid predominantly in three tandem copies, while the other was an extra-plasmid and extra-chromosomal free form. The latter must have been released from the plasmid in small quantities during replication, which may have resulted in some plasmids containing aberrant copies of the 4812 bp NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element.</p>

      <p>This case of isolating two NDM-1 positive strains of different species, <italic>R. planticola</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> isolated from the same patient provided an interesting scenario of emergence of NDM-1 within the same patient <italic>in vivo</italic>. The NDM-1 positive <italic>R. planticola</italic> strain was isolated when only mezlocillin/sulbactum, ceftizoxime and linezolid were used, suggesting that the emerging of NDM-1 was not due to administration of carbapenem antibiotics in this case. However, the NDM-1 positive <italic>E. coli</italic> was isolated after administration of imipenem which may have allowed the selection of an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain that possessed NDM-1. The 9332 bp fragment carrying an unusually truncated <italic>dfrA27</italic> gene was shared by the two plasmids, suggesting an additional link between the two <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> carrying plasmids pRpNDM-1 and pEcNDM1-4. The latter further harboured an additional gene cassette array, <italic>aacA4-cr</italic>-<italic>bla</italic><sub>OXA-30</sub>-<italic>catB3</italic>, which is highly prevalent in <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, with a 218 bp deletion in the 5&#x2032;-CS. This deletion would most likely have been generated when the gene cassette array was inserted in pEcNDM1-4. Therefore the likely process is that <italic>E. coli</italic> acquired <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub>from <italic>R. planticola</italic> and additionally acquired the gene cassette array <italic>aacA4</italic>-<italic>bla</italic><sub>OXA-30</sub>-<italic>catB3</italic> from another <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> plasmid, such as pCF1-1. The alternative is acquisition of <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> by <italic>R. planticola</italic> from <italic>E. coli</italic>, which is also possible but less likely since acquisition of a 218 bp region to undo the deletion in pRpNDM1-1 is less probable. There is also a possibility that <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub>was gained from another source by one or both species independently.</p>
      <p>IS<italic>CR1</italic> element was first observed in class 1 integrons In6 and In7 in 1993 <xref rid="pone.0089893-Stokes1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Since then, IS<italic>CR1</italic> elements were shown to have a close association with trimethoprim, quinolone, aminoglycoside resistance genes and several &#x3B2;-lactamase genes. Two copies of IS<italic>CR1</italic> with a 3&#x2032;CS upstream flanking different subtypes of <italic>qnr</italic> genes were also reported in China <xref rid="pone.0089893-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, France <xref rid="pone.0089893-Mammeri1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and other countries <xref rid="pone.0089893-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> has always been found to be carried on a structure consisting of a partial IS<italic>Aba125</italic> and a <italic>ble</italic><sub>MBL</sub> gene with <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> sandwiched between them <xref rid="pone.0089893-Yong1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. IS<italic>CR1</italic> elements adjacent to the conserved IS<italic>Aba125</italic>-<italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub>- <italic>ble</italic><sub>MBL</sub> structure have been reported <xref rid="pone.0089893-Yong1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089893-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089893-Janvier1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, this is the first time to report that <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> was flanked by an IS<italic>CR1</italic> element on both sides. The conserved 1596 bp IS<italic>Aba125</italic>-<italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub>- <italic>ble</italic><sub>MBL</sub> region was flanked by a copy of the integron 3&#x2032;CS <italic>qacE1/sul</italic> and IS<italic>CR1</italic> on both sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089893-g003">Figure 3a</xref>) in the two NDM-1 carrying plasmids of different species <italic>R. planticola</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p>
      <p>IS<italic>CR1</italic> is a known means of mobilizing its adjacent sequence via rolling circle transposition. Partridge and Hall <xref rid="pone.0089893-Partridge1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and Toleman <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0089893-Toleman2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> demonstrated that rolling circle replication of the IS<italic>CR1</italic> element can produce circular modules that include the IS<italic>CR1</italic> and its upstream adjacent antibiotic resistance genes. These circular modules can then be rescued by recombination between homologous fragments. The 4812 bp NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element may be mobilized by rolling circle transposition. Our isolation of two nearly identical <italic>E. coli</italic> strains from the same fecal sample with only one being NDM-1 positive presented an interesting scenario for the acquisition of <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> and provided a vehicle for experimental transfer of NDM-1 antibiotic resistance. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> transformation experiment using a synthesized circular 4812 bp NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic>element showed that the element successfully transformed EcNDMneg containing plasmid pEcNDMneg-4 to a NDM-1 positive strain with the precise insertion of the element into the IS<italic>CR1</italic> downstream in pEcNDMneg-4 to create an identical gene arrangement to pEcNDM1-4, demonstrating its mobility via IS<italic>CR1</italic>. However, <italic>in vitro</italic> transformation is artificial. There are likely other mechanisms of transfer.</p>
      <p>The advantage for the <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> gene embedding in a class 1 integron IS<italic>CR1</italic> complex is that one of the most widely used mechanisms for the spread of antibiotics resistance across species is harnessed for NDM-1 dissemination. Therefore in addition to clonal expansion of a NDM-1 positive strain, NDM-1 can spread by multiple means including inter-strain spread within and between species through plasmids, transposons and the NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element. Given that strains carrying class 1 integrons or IS<italic>CR1</italic> complex class1 integrons are common among bacteria <xref rid="pone.0089893-Toleman1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089893-Toleman2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089893-RodriguezMartinez1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, this is potentially a highly effective means for the spread of <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> was found to be embedded in an IS<italic>CR1</italic> complex class 1 integron, which is most likely responsible for the <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> transfer between <italic>R. planticola</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> in a patient <italic>in vivo</italic>. The novel 4812 bp NDM-1-IS<italic>CR1</italic> element which can self excise to become a free form could provide a new vehicle for NDM-1 dissemination.</p>
