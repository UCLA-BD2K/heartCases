        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Systemic sclerosis (SSc)-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) has become the leading SSc-related cause of death. Although various types of immunosuppressive therapy have been attempted for patients with SSc-ILD, no curative or effective treatment strategies for SSc-ILD have been developed. Therefore, management of patients with SSc-ILD remains a challenge. Here, we report a Chinese, female, SSc-ILD patient who was negative for Scl-70 and showed an excellent response to pirfenidone without obvious adverse effects. She had been suffered from dry cough and exertional dyspnea for 2 months. The chest computed tomography manifestation was consistent with a pattern of fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. The pulmonary function test showed isolated impaired diffusion. After 11 weeks of administration of pirfenidone, the dry cough and dyspnea had disappeared. Both of the lung shadows and the pulmonary diffusion function were improved. Pirfenidone might be an effective option for early SSc-ILD treatment. A well-controlled clinical trial is expected in the future.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Thoracic involvement occurs in approximately 80% of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), and interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the most common manifestation of SSc-associated respiratory diseases.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, SSc-associated ILD (SSc-ILD) has become the leading SSc-related cause of death. Although various types of immunosuppressive therapy have been attempted for patients with SSc-ILD, no curative or effective treatment strategies for SSc-ILD have been developed.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Therefore, management of patients with SSc-ILD remains a challenge.</p>
      <p>Pirfenidone is a novel agent that exerts antifibrotic and antioxidant effects, and it has been recommended for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) according to an IPF treatment guideline published several months ago.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Since April 2014, pirfenidone has been used in China for IPF patients with mild to moderate lung function impairment.</p>
      <p>Following several cases reports regarding the use of pirfenidone for SSc-ILD,<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> pirfenidone was attempted in a 62-year-old, female, Chinese SSc-ILD patient, who showed an excellent response to pirfenidone without obvious adverse effects. Written informed consent for the case report was obtained from this patient, and the consent procedure was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital.</p>

      <title>Case report</title>
      <p>A 62-year-old Han woman with no medical history presented with a 2-month history of dry cough and exertional dyspnea (since February 2015). She had exhibited skin thickening on the fingers of both hands (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and Raynaud phenomenon for several years. She was a nonsmoker. Bibasilar inspiratory crackles could be heard. Her body weight was approximately 63&#x200A;kg. An antinuclear antibody (ANA) test was positive with a speckled pattern at a 1:320 dilution. An anticentromere antibody (ACA) test was strongly positive at a 1:1000 dilution. However, an anti-Scl-70 antibody test was negative. The chest high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan was consistent with a pattern of fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (fNSIP) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). Pulmonary function testing revealed isolated impaired diffusion: forced vital capacity (FVC), the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) to FVC (FEV1/FVC), 74%, 2.95 L (124% predicted); total lung capacity (TLC), 4.84 L (102% predicted); and diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco), 4.02&#x200A;mmol/min per kPa (57.9% predicted). Pulmonary hypertension was not detected by transthoracic echocardiography. A bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis showed a lymphocytic cellular pattern with 26% lymphocytes and a total cell count of 6.7&#x200A;&#xD7;&#x200A;10<sup>7</sup>/L. A transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) showed fibrotic interstitial pneumonia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A and B), and an fNSIP pattern was suspected. The patient was diagnosed with SSc-ILD after a multidisciplinary discussion with a pulmonologist, a rheumatologist, a pathologist, and a radiologist.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Because the patient refused corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, pirfenidone was prescribed for her. She tolerated pirfenidone well (400&#x200A;mg 3 times a day), and she remained at this dosage for economic reasons. On July 15, 2015, after 11 weeks of administration of pirfenidone, the dry cough and dyspnea had disappeared. The bibasilar crackles and skin thickening of the fingers were also improved. Repeated chest HRCT on July 16 showed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B) improved lung shadows, and her lung function also exhibited improved diffusion with a DLco of 81.9% of the predicted value and a stable FVC of 2.98 L (126% predicted). Pirfenidone was continuously prescribed. The pirfenidone currently remains effective, that is, after 6 months of treatment with pirfenidone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>SSc is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, especially the respiratory system. SSc-associated lung disease, including ILD and pulmonary hypertension, has become the leading cause of SSc cases,<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> and SSc-ILD is more common than pulmonary hypertension. It has been reported that up to 100% of patients with SSc have pulmonary parenchymal involvement on autopsy.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Although multiple clinical trials have been performed for the treatment of SSc-ILD, including evaluations of the efficacy of cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and rituximab, no effective treatments for SSc-ILD have been developed.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Because interstitial fibrosis, including fNSIP patterns and UIP patterns, is common in SSc-ILD,<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> and transforming growth factor-&#x3B2; (TGF-&#x3B2;) might also play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Sc-ILD,<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> antifibrotic therapy is now being attempted for SSc-ILD cases, for example, some clinical trials of new antifibrotic agents for SSc-ILD are expected.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup></p>
      <p>Pirfenidone (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-[1H]-pyridone) has shown antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties in in vitro and animal models.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> It can attenuate the production of proinflammatory cytokines, collagen, and profibrotic cytokines such as TGF-&#x3B2;, and it can also increase the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> After many clinical trials, pirfenidone was approved due to its efficacy in the treatment of patients with IPF in Japan,<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> the European Union,<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> and the United States.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Currently, it has been conditionally recommended for patients with IPF according to this year's IPF treatment guidelines,<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> and since April 2014, it has been used in China for patients with IPF.</p>
      <p>Recently, a clinical trial regarding the efficacy and safety of 8% pirfenidone gel for localized scleroderma showed that pirfenidone could improve the scleroderma skin severity score, durometer induration of scleroderma plaques, and even histopathological skin manifestations. Moreover, no obvious clinical or laboratorial adverse effects have been reported.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Although no outcomes of the clinical trials of pirfenidone for SSc-ILD have been reported until now, some case reports have been published regarding the efficacy of pirfenidone for patients with SSc-ILD positive for Scl-70.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> In Miura's report, which included 5 cases with SSc-ILD positive for Scl-70, some of the patients showed improvement of dyspnea, some patients showed increased vital capacity, and some showed attenuation of ground-glass opacities (GGOs).<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> However, no data regarding the changes in TLC and DLco after the administration of pirfenidone have been recorded. Udwadia also reported the treatment of a case of Scl-70-positive SSc-ILD with pirfenidone. This patient showed improvement in effort tolerance, FVC, DLco, and 6-min walk test-associated parameters.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> No progression of CT imaging was observed in this patient.</p>
      <p>The present case might be the first of SSc-ILD case in China with reversal of lung function impairment and reduction of lung reticular shadows after pirfenidone administration. Our patient was negative for Scl-70 but positive for ACA, which is different from the reported cases.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Although the recommended dosage of pirfenidone was 1800&#x200A;mg/d for Chinese patients with IPF, she received only 1200&#x200A;mg/d due to economic reasons. However, she had improved respiratory and skin manifestations, obviously increased diffusion of lung function, and attenuation of reticules and GGOs on chest CT imaging after 3 months of treatment of pirfenidone. In Miura's report, GGOs, but not honeycombing, decreased after pirfenidone administration. These results suggested that pirfenidone might have better effects for improving early fibrosis than end-stage lung fibrosis.</p>
      <p>There were some limitations of our report. First, TBLB, but not a surgical lung biopsy, was performed for our patient; therefore, the fNSIP pathological pattern was only probable. Second, the patient did not receive the recommended dosage of pirfenidone for economic reasons. Third, she had been treated with only pirfenidone for 6 months. The long-term efficacy and safety of pirfenidone were observed.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>We reported a case of SSc-ILD in a Chinese woman who was negative for Scl-70 and positive for ACA and showed an excellent response to pirfenidone with no obvious adverse effects. Pirfenidone might be an effective option for early SSc-ILD treatment. A well-controlled clinical trial is expected in the future.</p>
