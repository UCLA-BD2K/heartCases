      <abstract>
        <p>Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs) are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders affecting neuromuscular transmission. The agrin/muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) pathway is critical for proper development and maintenance of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). We report here an Iranian patient in whom CMS was diagnosed since he presented with congenital and fluctuating bilateral symmetric ptosis, upward gaze palsy and slowly progressive muscle weakness leading to loss of ambulation. Genetic analysis of the patient revealed a homozygous missense mutation c.2503A&gt;G in the coding sequence of <italic>MUSK</italic> leading to the p.Met835Val substitution. The mutation was inherited from the two parents who were heterozygous according to the notion of consanguinity. Immunocytochemical and electron microscopy studies of biopsied deltoid muscle showed dramatic changes in pre- and post-synaptic elements of the NMJs. These changes induced a process of denervation/reinnervation in native NMJs and the formation, by an adaptive mechanism, of newly formed and ectopic NMJs. Aberrant axonal outgrowth, decreased nerve terminal ramification and nodal axonal sprouting were also noted. <italic>In vivo</italic> electroporation of the mutated MuSK in a mouse model showed disorganized NMJs and aberrant axonal growth reproducing a phenotype similar to that observed in the patient&#x2019;s biopsy specimen. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments showed that the mutation alters agrin-dependent acetylcholine receptor aggregation, causes a constitutive activation of MuSK and a decrease in its agrin- and Dok-7-dependent phosphorylation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The NMJ is a highly specialized structure formed by a motoneuron, a terminal Schwann cell and a muscle fiber. The contact between the nerve terminal and the muscle membrane constitutes a privileged zone in which neurotransmission occurs. At this synapse, the nerve terminal organizes postsynaptic differentiation by releasing a proteoglycan called agrin which binds to its receptor, a low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-related protein (Lrp4) located on the postsynaptic membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Kim1">[1]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Zhang2">[3]</xref>. Lrp4 forms a complex with the muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) which plays a central role in the organization of the postsynaptic scaffold. MuSK activation is required to recruit downstream signaling components that trigger the local aggregation and synthesis of postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and several other proteins, such as the cytoskeletal protein rapsyn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Sobel1">[4]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Zong1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>MuSK is a tyrosine kinase receptor with an ectodomain containing three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains and a Frizzled-like cysteine-rich domain (initially described as a C box plus a fourth Ig-like domain), a transmembrane-spanning region, and the intracellular region including a juxtamembrane domain, a kinase domain, and a short C-terminal tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Jennings1">[7]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Stiegler1">[9]</xref>. In general, ligand binding to the extracellular portion of tyrosine kinase receptors results in autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues, which in turn increases the catalytic activity of the receptor and creates binding sites for other signaling proteins. The kinase activation loop (so-called &#x201C;A loop&#x201D;), whose conformation is changed for substrate interaction, and the juxtamembrane region located between the transmembrane helix and the tyrosine kinase domain are important regulatory regions for MuSK kinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Herbst1">[10]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Wiesner1">[12]</xref>. The juxtamembrane region of MuSK also contains a NPXY binding motif for the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of the cytoplasmic adapter-like protein Dok-7, which plays an essential role in the regulation of MuSK phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Strochlic1">[13]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Inoue1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The critical role of MuSK signaling is supported by the fact that mice deficient in agrin, Lrp4, MuSK, or Dok-7 lack NMJs and die at birth from respiratory failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Okada1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Gautam1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Weatherbee1">[17]</xref>. Consistently, RNA interference directed against MuSK or conditional postnatal inactivation of the <italic>musk</italic> gene causes disassembly of the postsynaptic components of NMJs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Kong1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Hesser1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs) are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders that give rise to neuromuscular transmission defects. CMSs are conveniently classified according to their target as presynaptic, synaptic (basal lamina-associated) or postsynaptic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Engel1">[20]</xref>. Postsynaptic CMSs are currently the most common category of CMSs and are usually the consequence of mutations in genes encoding the four adult muscle nAChR subunits or rapsyn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Engel2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Beeson1">[22]</xref>. It has recently been shown that mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the critical signal transduction pathway of MuSK requiring neural agrin, the muscle cytoplasmic protein Dok-7 and MuSK itself can also result in severe forms of CMSs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Chevessier1">[23]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Huz1">[25]</xref>. Since our first demonstration that mutations in MuSK underlie a CMS, two other reports implicating MuSK mutations have been published: a homozygous missense mutation in the ectodomain of MuSK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Mihaylova1">[26]</xref> and heterozygous missense mutations in its kinase domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Maselli1">[27]</xref>.

        <title>Histopathologic Studies of Patient&#x2019;s Biopsied Muscle</title>
        <p>Open biopsy was performed on the deltoid muscle. The NMJ-containing zone was determined by small twitches provoked by the scalpel tip and confirmed by the presence of cholinesterase activity using the classic technique of Koelle and Friedenwald <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Koelle1">[28]</xref>. Whole fibers fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde were stained for AChRs with TRITC-labeled alpha-bungarotoxin (&#x3B1;-BGT) (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands), and for neurofilaments with an anti-168 kD neurofilament antibody (2H3 clone, Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA) or an anti-200 kD neurofilament antibody (RT 97 clone, Boehringer Ingelheim, Reims, France). In addition, cryostat sections were labeled with &#x3B1;-BGT and an anti-MuSK antibody (kindly donated by Markus R&#xFC;egg, Basel, Switzerland). Both whole fibers and cryostat sections were observed with a confocal microscope (Zeiss, LSM 510) and images were acquired with the equivalent settings (laser power, gain, magnification, thickness of the stacks). The area of synaptic gutters per NMJ and the mean &#x3B1;-bungarotoxin fluorescence intensity within that area were measured using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging, Westchester, PA, USA). Fluorescence intensity quantification of MuSK was not feasible on whole mount preparation because of the lack of sample and was therefore performed on cryostat section using the same software. Electron microscopy of the NMJ was performed by conventional methods.</p>

        <title>Clinical Data</title>
        <p>A 12-year-old boy presented with congenital bilateral ptosis and slowly progressive muscle weakness, particularly in the lower limbs, which had been observed since the age of 4. He had no sucking problems during infancy and started to walk at 14 months. A history of nocturnal sleep apnea during childhood was mentioned by the parents. There was aggravation of symptoms following infections or exposure to cold without fluctuation of weakness during the day. There were neither swallowing problems nor any crisis requiring hospitalization. His parents were cousins from north-western province of Qazvin in Iran. He had a healthy younger sister. There was no history of similar diseases in the family.</p>
        <p>Neurologic examination revealed severe bilateral symmetric ptosis and upward gaze palsy, without involvement of the orbicularis oculi. Atrophy of distal lower limb muscles and the tongue was noted. There were no fasciculations, scoliosis, or joint contractures. Bulbar and masticatory muscles were intact, while exertional dyspnea and mild axial muscle weakness were noted. Muscle weakness in all four limbs was more marked proximally and there was a waddling gait as well as positive Gowers&#x2019; sign. Based on the quantitative myasthenia gravis score <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Bedlack1">[33]</xref>, proximal upper limbs showed moderate clinical fatigability and lower limb proximal muscles revealed mild clinical fatigability. Deep tendon reflexes and sensory data were normal.</p>
        <p>The anticholinesterase test with ambenonium chloride (Mytelase) or edrophonium chloride (Tensilon) showed no dramatic positive response. Serum creatine kinase concentration was 53 U/L and anti-nAChR antibodies were not present. Electrocardiography and echocardiography showed no significant abnormality, while vital capacity on spirometry was 68% of the normal value.</p>
        <p>Sensory and motor nerve conduction velocities were normal. On electromyographic examination, motor units showed a myopathic pattern with low amplitude short duration polyphasic potentials detected in several muscles. No significant decremental response was noted on 3 Hz repetitive stimulation of forearm and spinal muscles.</p>
        <p>Computerized tomography of limb muscles showed diffuse, global amyotrophy, predominantly in the lower limbs without any density abnormalities in the observed muscle masses.</p>
        <p>Treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors (pyridostigmine) was not successful. The patient underwent muscle biopsy and blood samples were taken for genetic studies. Six years after his first visit (at 18 years of age), he lost ambulation and could walk only with help. The patient had one episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizure at the age of 18 and two successive (within four hours) seizures at 19 years old, which were then controlled by carbamazepine. Three months later, he developed a severe pulmonary infection and died at a local intensive care unit within one week.</p>

          <title>Evaluation of agrin-dependent MuSK phosphorylation</title>
          <p>To investigate if MuSK activation was impaired by the mutation, MuSK phosphorylation was measured in 293T cells transfected with WT- or MV-MuSK constructs in combination or not with Lrp4. The cells were further treated or not with agrin (10 nM). MuSK was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate with an anti-HA antibody, and visualized on western blots with the same antibody as well as with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053826-g008">Figure 8</xref>). As expected, Lrp4 was required for WT-MuSK phosphorylation in response to agrin. However, it had no effect on MV-MuSK phosphorylation. Indeed, the MV-MuSK mutant, either alone or in combination with Lrp4, was already strongly phosphorylated in the absence of agrin, and agrin treatment did not further stimulate its phosphorylation. In other words the MV-MuSK mutant was always more phosphorylated (3 times more) than WT MuSK, except in the presence of both Lrp4 and agrin where WT-MuSK reached the same level of activation as MV-MuSK mutant. This suggests that the mutation impairs the activation of MuSK phosphorylation by agrin by conferring to MuSK elevated basal levels of phosphorylation. To test whether this unexpected phosphorylation of MV MuSK was due to the phosphorylation of normally unexposed tyrosine residues, unmasked by a change in the conformation of MV MuSK, by another cellular kinase, we expressed a kinase-dead MV-MuSK. We concluded that this was not the case since phosphorylation of MV MuSK was completely abolished in the context of an inactive MuSK kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053826-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We report a novel mutation in <italic>MUSK</italic> leading to a CMS. We formerly described two CMS siblings with a frameshift and a missense mutation in MuSK (c.220insC and V790M) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Chevessier1">[23]</xref>. Since then, only two other families have been described with CMS due to MuSK mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Mihaylova1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Maselli1">[27]</xref>. The one reported in this paper is a homozygous missense mutation M835V located in the kinase domain, like the previously reported mutations V790M <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Mihaylova1">[26]</xref>, M605I and A727V <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Maselli1">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The patient had a progressively deteriorating course starting from infancy with some worsening in cold weather and during infections, and finally died of a pulmonary infection, while the previous MuSK patient (bearing c.220insC with V790M mutations) showed, apart from her infancy, a more favorable course during the first two decades of life and at the present time is only suffering from ptosis and upper limb weakness. However, it should be noted that our Iranian patient was never treated by the combination of pyridostigmine and diaminopyridine (DAP), which was very efficacious for our first case <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Chevessier1">[23]</xref> and mildly beneficial for the Sudanese siblings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Mihaylova1">[26]</xref>. In contrast to many myasthenic patients, our patient did not show daytime fluctuation of symptoms with worsening in the evening, bulbar symptoms or frank decremental response on electromyography. Tongue atrophy, which is a characteristic sign in the anti-MuSK antibody positive type of autoimmune myasthenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Vincent1">[36]</xref>, was a remarkable finding in our patient and has also been reported in two CMS patients with Dok-7 mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Mller1">[37]</xref>.</p>
      <p>MuSK is known to be a key component in orchestrating both formation and maintenance of NMJs. The patient&#x2019;s biopsy exhibited high plasticity of the NMJs with about 70% of denervated or remodeled NMJs. It also showed a 50% decrease of the average number of nAChR (-50%) and a compensatory increase of axonal sprouts, as was observed in mouse, where MuSK perturbation in adult muscle by RNA interference also induced sprouting of presynaptic nerve terminals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Kong1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Two types of sprouting can be distinguished in the biopsies: terminal and nodal, with a major predominance of the latter. It is assumed that <bold>terminal sprouts</bold> may be due to NMJ local factors related to insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Apel1">[38]</xref>. Muscle IGFs could play a role in intramuscular nerve sprouting and are probably signaling factors from inactivated muscle to promote local restorative reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Caroni1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Tam1">[40]</xref>. <bold>Nodal sprouts</bold> appear far from the synaptic cleft and are therefore unlikely to be under direct influence of NMJ local factors. We assume that their formation is partly controlled by factors released by muscle or Schwann cells. Such factors could be modified then transported by the retrograde axonal flow. Muscle-derived retrograde signals might also be passed to motor neuron terminals via terminal Schwann cells, which are essential components for growth, maturation, and maintenance of the NMJ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Tam1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Feng1">[41]</xref>. The hypothesis of disturbed axonal flows is particularly supported by the presence of a smooth endoplasmic reticulum network in the patient&#x2019;s axons. This smooth endoplasmic reticulum network has already been described in frontal biopsy specimens from patients with Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Richard1">[42]</xref> and in motor axon from Trembler mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-DoThi1">[35]</xref> and can be attributed to disturbances of axoplasmic flow.</p>
      <p>Evidence that the M835V mutation is responsible for high NMJ remodeling capacity, decreased number of nAChR and both nodal and terminal compensatory innervation is provided by reproducing these same results in electroporated mouse muscle. The fact that the mutated MuSK was expressed in the presence of endogenous MuSK could suggest that the mutated MuSK had a dominant negative effect on wild-type MuSK. This would be in contradistinction with the recessive expression of the mutation in human. The most probable explanation is that, owing to the electroporation efficiency, the number of mutated MuSK molecules sufficiently exceeded that of endogenous MuSK to displace it from all its cellular partners and thus, that only the mutated MuSK was functional at the NMJ. In other words, the fact that elevated levels of mutated MuSK generated the same effect as in the patient likely shows that the phenotype is not attributable to reduced levels of MuSK, but rather to an altered ability of the mutated MuSK to perform its physiological function.</p>
      <p>An interesting observation was that agrin had almost no effect on the ability of the MV MuSK mutant to induce nAChR aggregation, while a twofold reduction of the clusters was observed in agrin-treated muscle cells expressing either MuSK V789M or MuSK M605I as compared with cells expressing MuSK WT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Chevessier1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Maselli1">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To address this point, MuSK phosphorylation was measured in heterologous cells in the absence of agrin and we found that MV MuSK was already phosphorylated and that agrin treatment did not significantly increase its phosphorylation. This &#x201C;spontaneous&#x201D; phosphorylation was not due to phosphorylation of other residues than those phosphorylated in WT-MuSK since introducing the kinase-dead mutation K608A completely abolished phosphorylation both in WT and MV-MuSK. It is generally accepted that the activation of MuSK is linked to its dimerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Hopf1">[43]</xref>. Consistently, the expression of the MuSKneuTMuSK homodimer in the extrasynaptic zone of a muscle induces the formation of AChR aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Jones1">[44]</xref>. Whether or not conformational changes of MuSK, which are induced by the mutation - and discussed below - could lead to such spontaneous homodimerization of MuSK remains speculative, especially <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
      <p>As opposed to other RTKs which are only activated by their ligand, MuSK phosphorylation is known to be also increased by Dok-7, at least when overexpressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Inoue1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Bergamin1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Yamanashi1">[45]</xref>. We therefore asked if the induction of MuSK phosphorylation by Dok-7 was impaired by the mutation. Interestingly, MV MuSK phosphorylation in the presence of Dok7 was 60% lower than with WT MuSK. MuSK-Dok-7 co-immunoprecipitation experiments further showed that this could be due to reduced binding of Dok-7 to the mutated MuSK. It therefore appears that mutations in <italic>DOK7</italic> or <italic>MUSK</italic> leading to a CMS can impair at various levels MuSK phosphorylation and MuSK binding to Dok-7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Beeson2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Maselli1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Hamuro1">[46]</xref>. This impairment was striking for the present homozygous M835V <italic>MUSK</italic> mutation, more than for our previously described mutation (<italic>MUSK</italic> V790M) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Chevessier1">[23]</xref>. Being faced with the end-result in the patient, which is a twofold decrease of AChR number at the NMJ, knowing which combination of the above mechanisms (agrin/LRP4 and Dok-7 interaction with mutated MuSK) is actually taking place in the patient remains a question.</p>
      <p>According to the 3D model of MuSK structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Till1">[11]</xref>, the M835 residue is neither exposed to the solvent nor proximal to the catalytic residues. The effect of the mutation of this residue on MuSK phosphorylation is therefore likely to be allosteric rather than steric. An allosteric effect may be related to a loss of stability of the protein or a modification of its structure; however the M to V mutation might not be strong enough to induce such a drastic change at the molecular level because Methionine and Valine are both small hydrophobic residues. The mutation could also alter the conformational equilibrium associated with MuSK function. A similar explanation has been suggested in the case of the nAChR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Taly1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053826-Taly2">[48]</xref> following the observation that myasthenic mutations are not randomly distributed in the structure but rather clustered in zones that can control the activation of the receptor. Interestingly, the M835 residue is in the vicinity of V790 and A727, which are also associated with myasthenic syndromes; this proximity might be interpreted as an argument in favor of an allosteric effect modifying the conformational equilibrium. We can therefore speculate that the M835V mutation induces a change in function that counteracts agrin- and Dok-7-dependent typical activation of MuSK and that, <italic>in fine</italic>, is responsible for the patient&#x2019;s myasthenic syndrome.</p>
