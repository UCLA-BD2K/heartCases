      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The spontaneous regression of malignant tumors is defined as the partial or complete disappearance of a malignant tumor without therapy. This definition suggests that spontaneous regression applies to cases in which cancer is not always cured permanently (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Iwanaga estimated that spontaneous regression occurred in approximately 1 in 120,000 cancer cases per year in Japan in 2011 (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In addition, his report showed that the spontaneous regression of gastric cancer, which accounts for 8% of cases of spontaneous regression, is very rare and that regression of aggressive gastric cancers such as neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is especially unlikely. We herein report a case in which a lymph node metastasis of NEC disappeared after endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA).</p>

      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>A 75-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital to undergo an examination of an enlarged peripancreatic lymph node, which had been incidentally detected on abdominal ultrasonography that was performed to investigate pollakiuria. He had been relatively healthy with a past medical history of colon polyps. His family history was unremarkable. The patient was asymptomatic when he visited our hospital. His physical examination and laboratory data including tumor marker levels (carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9) showed no abnormalities. Computed tomography (CT) showed a lymph node of 47 mm in size that was located above the pancreas head and beneath the liver (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="g001">1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="g002">2a</xref>). This lymph node was located beneath the gastric antrum and not in contact with the stomach. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a submucosal tumor with ulceration at the gastric antrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="g003">Fig. 3</xref>). An immunohistological examination of the gastric biopsy specimens revealed a diagnosis of NEC that was positive for chromogranin-A and synaptophysin, with a Ki-67 index of more than 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="g004">Fig. 4</xref>). EUS-FNA of the enlarged lymph node was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="g005">Fig. 5</xref>). The examination of the sample obtained from the lymph node confirmed the immunohistological diagnosis of NEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Treatment with chemotherapy was discussed with the patient, but he rejected this opinion and instead chose observation.</p>

      <p>A week after the EUS-FNA procedure, the patient experienced a high fever (temperature of 40&#x2103;) and was readmitted. A laboratory analysis revealed that his white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level were abnormally elevated. Two positive blood cultures revealed infection with <italic>Streptococcus constellatus</italic>. CT demonstrated a peripherally enhanced low density mass at the location of the enlarged peripancreatic lymph node (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="g001">1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="g002">2b</xref>). We suspected that he had bacteremia and an abscess due to EUS-FNA, and treatment with tazobactam/piperacillin (4.5 g q6h) was started and continued for 16 days. He recovered after 3 weeks. At his request, no further treatment was initiated and a repeat CT was performed 6 months later. Surprisingly, the lymph node that had been subjected to EUS-FNA had disappeared. The lymph node remained undetectable at a follow-up CT examination that was performed at 12 months after EUS-FNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="g001">1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="g002">2c</xref>).</p>
      <p>However, 18 months after EUS-FNA, the patient presented with general malaise. The lymph node remained undetectable, but CT showed multiple liver tumors and that gastric tumor had increased (from 50 mm on the first CT to 60 mm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="g002">Fig. 2a and c</xref>). The patient refused to undergo follow-up upper gastrointestinal endoscopy; consequently, we did not evaluate the gastric tumor. We diagnosed the hepatic lesions as metastatic tumors from the gastric NEC. The patient was managed according to the best supportive care policy and gradually worsened. He died of multiple organ failure 19 months after undergoing the EUS-FNA procedure.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Bacteremia is a rare complication after diagnostic endoscopy. Several early studies showed an incidence rate of approximately 0-8% (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). EUS-FNA is a relatively safe method for diagnosing and evaluating gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal malignancies. Prophylactic antibiotics are therefore not recommended for the FNA of solid masses and lymph nodes (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). <italic>Streptococcus constellatus</italic>, which was detected in our case, is a member of the <italic>Streptococcus milleri</italic> group. These organisms reside as part of the normal flora in the human oral cavity and the gastrointestinal tract and have the ability to cause systemic infection. &#x3B2;-lactam agents remain the treatment of choice for <italic>Streptococcus milleri</italic> infections (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>); thus, treatment with tazobactam/piperacillin was effective in our case.</p>
      <p>We could not confirm the disappearance of metastatic lymph node after EUS-FNA. The patient died because of the progression of the primary gastric cancer; however, we considered that the metastatic lymph node might have become undetectable after EUS-FNA due to &#x201C;spontaneous regression.&#x201D; To date, according to a key word survey of the PubMed database, several studies have reported disappearance of metastatic lymph nodes in cancer patients after FNA or biopsy procedures (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In addition, the infiltration of inflammatory cells was found at the site of tumor regression. Some reports have described the accumulation of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells in the histological specimens of regressed tumors (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Taking into account the above points, we considered that the immunological responses might have promoted the disappearance of the metastatic lymph node in our case. We hypothesize that the EUS guided-fine needle injection of drugs promoting T cells and NK cells activities may be effective in the treatment of malignant tumors. Chang et al. have already reported the first attempt of fine needle injection under EUS guidance in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Various anti-tumor agents may be considered for immunological therapy. Certain types of cancer advance by down-regulating T cell activation and evade the immune system by expressing immunosuppressive programed death 1 (PD-1) ligands (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Several studies have shown that the anti-PD-1 antibody is a key immune checkpoint drug. The anti-PD-1 antibody plays a key role in tumor therapy (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>); hence, it may play a critical role in EUS guided-fine needle injection for tumor immunotherapy.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, although definite evidence is lacking, immune modulation caused by the EUS-FNA procedure might have contributed to local tumor regression. We considered that EUS-FNA and the ensuring bacterial infection stimulated an immunological phenomenon and caused the death of the cancer cells in the lymph node. Although further experiments are needed to confirm this hypothesis, the fine needle injection of immune-promoting drugs may be a useful as a tumor reduction therapy in the future.</p>
