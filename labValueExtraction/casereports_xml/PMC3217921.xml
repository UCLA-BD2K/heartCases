      <abstract>
        <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is an incurable age-related neurodegenerative disorder affecting both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Although common, the etiology of PD remains poorly understood. Genetic studies infer that the disease results from a complex interaction between genetics and environment and there is growing evidence that PD may represent a constellation of diseases with overlapping yet distinct underlying mechanisms. Novel clinical approaches will require a better understanding of the mechanisms at work within an individual as well as methods to identify the specific array of mechanisms that have contributed to the disease. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) strategies provide an opportunity to directly study the affected neuronal subtypes in a given patient. Here we report the generation of iPSC-derived midbrain dopaminergic neurons from a patient with a triplication in the &#x3B1;-synuclein gene (<italic>SNCA</italic>). We observed that the iPSCs readily differentiated into functional neurons. Importantly, the PD-affected line exhibited disease-related phenotypes in culture: accumulation of &#x3B1;-synuclein, inherent overexpression of markers of oxidative stress, and sensitivity to peroxide induced oxidative stress. These findings show that the dominantly-acting PD mutation is intrinsically capable of perturbing normal cell function in culture and confirm that these features reflect, at least in part, a cell autonomous disease process that is independent of exposure to the entire complexity of the diseased brain.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of neurons in both the peripheral and central nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Hughes1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Wakabayashi1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Langston1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Lewy1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Lewy2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Cookson1">[6]</xref>. The majority of cases result from unknown etiology causing widespread neuron loss in the midbrain, cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, and peripheral nervous system. Neuron degeneration is pronounced in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta leading to the diagnostic clinical features of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Hughes1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Wakabayashi1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Langston1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Lewy1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Lewy2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Cookson1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Dawson1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Genetic studies have implicated several potential mechanisms but the etiology of Parkinson's disease remains obscure. In a large cohort of patients, Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites form in CNS and autonomic peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons. These large intracellular proteinaceous inclusions are rich in &#x3B1;-synuclein and ubiquitin, an observation that suggests a role for &#x3B1;-synuclein and the proteasome in the molecular development of sporadic and genetic PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Wakabayashi2">[8]</xref>. However, not all patients with PD develop Lewy bodies. Although alterations in LRRK2 are commonly associated with PD, many of these patients do not exhibit a Lewy phenotype and it is thought that protein aggregration may be a disease modifier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Zimprich1">[9]</xref>. Methods to identify patients with an intrinsic aggregration phenotype may be useful in categorizing disease as well as in correctly targeting disease-modifying interventions to an appropriate class of patients. To explore the potential use of iPSC-derived neurons in detecting protein accumulation and aggregation phenotypes, we report the generation of iPSCs from a patient with a dominant autosomal form of PD caused by triplication of the <italic>SNCA</italic> locus. Dosage is known to influence disease progression with triplications causing earlier onset and more rapid progression than duplications of <italic>SNCA</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Ibanez1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Singleton1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Maries1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Waters1">[13]</xref>. Given their pronounced <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype, <italic>SNCA</italic> triplications were selected to provide the highest probability of detecting disease-related phenotype that may be useful in categorizing disease characteristics in patient-derived neurons.</p>
      <p>Familial autosomal dominant forms of PD have been documented in families with <italic>SNCA</italic> mutations or gene duplication/triplications as well as in families with mutations in proteins regulating the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Singleton1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-ChartierHarlin1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Polymeropoulos1">[15]</xref>. &#x3B1;-Synuclein protein aggregation and markers of cellular stress are also seen in other neurodegenerative disorders including dementia with Lewy bodies, pure autonomic failure, and multiple system atrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Marti1">[16]</xref>. Although overexpression of &#x3B1;-synuclein transgenes leads to protein aggregation in normal cells, the study of native processes leading to aggregation in affected individuals has been hindered by the inaccessibility of human neurons <italic>in vivo</italic>, the limitations inherent in studying postmortem samples from PD patients, and the inability to accurately recapitulate human disease in transgene models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Maries1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Kirik1">[17]</xref>. Here we report that neurons derived from a SNCA triplication patient exhibit intrinsic protein accumulation and aggregation phenotypes.</p>

        <title>Patient Clinical Presentation</title>
        <p>The subject of this study was a 48-year-old male with an <italic>SNCA</italic> triplication (Trpl-HDF). The patient presented with early onset, autosomal dominant, PD at age 38. The patient was left-handed and had been in excellent health most of his life. His initial symptoms in 2007 were fatigue, tremor and decreased dexterity. At that time, he was not experiencing any changes in speech, gait or cognition. He had undergone an MRI scan, which was unremarkable. He exhibited a resting and mild intention tremor, but his gait was normal. Thus, in 2007, the patient appeared to have mild Parkinson's disease and no medication was required.</p>
        <p>At the time of the clinical examination in summer 2008, the patient noted mild problems with recent memory. He did not experience any psychiatric symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations but reported some anxiety and slight depression. He also reported urinary urgency and occasional constipation. He indicated that he had normal sleep patterns but in speaking with his wife he did exhibit nocturnal features suggesting REM behavioral disorder. He had undergone a sleep study and apparently obstructive sleep apnea was suspected, but did not tolerate continuous positive airway pressure. The patient stated that his sense of smell was poor for at least one year and the B-SIT smell test showed abnormal sense of smell with 6/12 points. From time to time he noted periodic blurring of vision and diplopia and had obtained new corrective lenses. He was also experiencing motor fluctuations on his current medication schedule. He stated that in the &#x201C;on&#x201D; state he is nearly normal, but continued to experience difficulty with his handwriting. When he is in the &#x201C;off&#x201D; state or when the medication wears out, his speech slowed, he drooled, his handwriting worsened, and he had more difficulty with dexterity such as dressing or hygienic activities. He had not noticed any difficulty with his balance, but reported that when his medication wore off he experienced hesitation on turning. Tremor also worsened when the medication wore off. In addition, the patient noted some upper back pain. He estimated about 80% of the day was in the &#x201C;on&#x201D; state and had not experienced any dyskinesia. There was a mild to moderate rest tremor of his left hand and a slight tremor of his right hand in addition to an action tremor of mild degree left greater than right. He was able to rise from the chair and walk with no difficulty. His stride was normal but there was axial rigidity and loss of arm swing bilaterally. A slight hesitation on turning when asked to multitask while he walked. There was no sign of ataxia on finger nose or heel shin testing and he did not exhibit dystonia or dyskinesia. Symptoms suggested typical progression of Parkinson's disease.</p>

        <title>Generation of iPSCs</title>
        <p>A skin biopsy was taken and iPSCs were generated from primary human dermal fibroblasts (Trpl-HDF) and from HDFs isolated from his unaffected sister (Ctrl-HDF) with a normal <italic>SNCA</italic> copy number. Trpl-HDF and Ctrl-HDF were reprogrammed by induced expression of the exogenous transcription factors <italic>OCT4</italic>, <italic>SOX2</italic>, <italic>KLF4</italic>, and <italic>c-MYC</italic>, through retroviral gene insertion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Kim1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Park1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Takahashi1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Takahashi2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Yu1">[22]</xref>, and resulting iPSC clones were expanded and characterized for human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-like properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026159-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Multiple iPSC clones from each donor line were similar to hESCs with respect to morphology, expansion, gene expression, epigenetic regulation, and teratoma formation. Representative hESC-like clones from each donor were selected for further analysis. All clones that were analyzed maintained hESC-like properties in culture for more than 30 passages on MEF feeders and in feeder free media and expressed pluripotency-associated antigens: alkaline phosphatase (AP), TRA1-60, TRA1-81, NANOG, SSEA-1, SSEA-3, and SSEA-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026159-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026159.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). To ensure line stability, selected reprogrammed clones were further examined for karyotype and silencing of exogenous reprogramming factors. We observed that the karyotype was normal and that there was robust silencing of the exogenous retroviral-based reprogramming factors, as detected by RT-PCR, while expression of endogenous pluripotency transcription factors was comparable to levels in native H9 hESCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026159.s001">Fig. S1B and C</xref>).</p>

        <p>Immunofluorescent (IF) staining was used to evaluate differentiated cultures for the presence of nestin, a type VI intermediate filament protein indicative of neural progenitor cells; doublecortin (DCX), a microtubule-associated protein found in immature neurons; and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis, indicative of dopaminergic neurons. After 50 days of differentiation, the cultures contained nestin-positive neural progenitors, DCX-positive immature neurons and TH-positive mature DA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026159-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>)</p>
        <p>Neurons were often localized in islands of differentiating nestin-positive progenitor cells.

        <p>To further characterize the progression of events that accompanies differentiation, gene expression profiles were evaluated at different stages during the differentiation process using microfluidic, high-density quantitative PCR (qPCR). Samples of 500&#x2013;1000 cells were manually collected from replicate cultures of undifferentiated pluripotent cells, cultures highly enriched for neural rosettes, and cultures enriched for mature neurons (days 0, 28 and 50, respectively). Cells were lysed and processed for expression analysis of a 96-gene panel diagnostic of pluripotent stem cells, endoderm, mesoderm, neural crest and CNS cells, including neurons and glia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026159.s011">Material S1</xref>).

        <p>We used cluster analysis to examine gene expression and time points across the sample groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026159-g002">Fig. 2J</xref>). We observed that samples self-clustered primarily by stage of differentiation and secondarily by iPSC line confirming that <italic>SNCA</italic> triplication and control lines were highly similar in both gene expression and differentiation patterns. Moreover, genes clustered into functional groups that correlated with developmental and cell-type specific groups, providing evidence of native differentiation cascades expected for normal neural development. The clustered group of undifferentiated samples from Trpl8, Trpl17, Trpl43 and Ctrl1, Ctrl2 and Ctrl3 iPSCs, as well as, H9 hESCs showed higher expression of the self-clustered group of pluripotency related genes, <italic>FOXD3</italic>, <italic>NANOG</italic>, <italic>LIN28</italic>, <italic>OCT4</italic>, <italic>TERT</italic> and <italic>DNMT3B</italic> relative to differentiated cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026159.s008">Fig. S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026159.s009">S9</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Parkinson's disease results from a complex interplay of genetics and environment. Not all patients exhibit identical features and future clinical approaches may benefit from diagnostic methods that predict disease mechanism and classify patients by virtue of neuron-intrinsic disease features. Here, we present data that indicates that differentiation of pluripotent stem cells may provide a cell-based model to detect cell autonomous disease processes based on protein deregulation/accumulation. The cell lines that we generated were derived from a PD patient with a naturally-occurring genomic triplication of the <italic>SNCA</italic> gene and his unaffected sibling. Importantly, the PD-affected line exhibited several disease-related phenotypes in culture: accumulation of &#x3B1;-synuclein, inherent overexpression of markers of oxidative stress, and sensitivity to peroxide induced oxidative stress. These findings show that the dominantly-acting PD mutation is intrinsically capable of perturbing normal cell function in culture and confirm that these features reflect, at least in part, a cell autonomous disease process that is independent of exposure to the entire complexity of the diseased brain. Importantly, this cell line contains wild type, non-mutant, &#x3B1;-synuclein, and thus is likely to reflect key characteristics relevant to the pathogenesis of the greater idiopathic PD patient population that display a similar protein aggregations. In idiopathic disease &#x3B1;-synuclein levels may be deregulated through epigenetics, environmental or a multifactorial process that result in similarly elevated &#x3B1;-synuclein and thereby initiate and propagates PD in a similar manner to the SNCA triplication neurons presented here.</p>
      <p>Although the data presented here indicates that elevated wild-type &#x3B1;-synuclein is sufficient for cell-intrinsic vulnerability, the mechanism of pathogenic action is still unknown. The elevation of oxidative stress and aggregation of interacting proteins in the diseased line are consistent with free radical accumulation, perhaps as a result of protein aggregation-induced alterations in ubiquitin-proteasome function. Such perturbations in protein dynamics may influence the efficient removal or neutralization of oxidative molecules from the mitochondria's electron transport chain or tyrosine hydrolysis in dopaminergic neurons leading to increased neuron vulnerability. Although loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons produces the prominent clinical features of PD, the degenerative process extends well beyond the midbrain dopaminergic neurons to affect autonomic function, cognition and mood. We confirm here that both TH-positive and TH-negative neurons display ubiquitinated intracellular inclusions. This is consistent with the dominant disease inheritance of the wild-type SNCA triplication with expression of SNCA in all neurons, and indicates that patient-derived iPSC can be used to study disease mechanisms and selective vulnerably across the many neuron subtypes involved in PD.</p>
      <p>SNCA is not the only gene linked to hereditary PD. Mutations in LRRK2, UCHL1, PARKIN and others can lead to autosomal dominant inherited forms of PD, suggesting that the proteins encoded by these genes play an important role in neural cell homeostasis. In parallel work, we have shown that vulnerability and PD related phenotypes can be detected in iPSC-derived DA neurons, however, the apoptotic vulnerability was lower in the SNCA triplication lines than observed in DA neurons derived from a LRRK2-G2019S homozygous iPSC line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026159-Nguyen1">[34]</xref>. Although both LRRK2 and SNCA mutations induce autosomal dominant forms of PD, the SNCA triplication line expresses higher levels of a normal protein while the LRRK2-G2019S missense mutation encodes a mutant protein, which in the homozygous state produces a more pronounced apoptotic vulnerability. In contrast, intracellular inclusions appeared to be more pronounced in differentiated neurons carrying the SNCA triplication.</p>
      <p>Protein accumulation, oxidative stress marker increases and caspase activity in SNCA triplication iPSC-derived DA neurons demonstrates that PD linked mutations can produce detectable features of disease in young neurons, and we anticipate that the derivation of iPSC from both genetic and idiopathic patients will ultimately define whether a given mutation or more complex polygenic background confers a cell-autonomous vulnerability or whether the disease process in a given class of patients requires additional environmental or epigenetic contribution to confer selective vulnerability in dopaminergic neurons. The ability to observe disease-related phenotypes in PD iPSC-derived neurons across patient groups provides a useful platform for studying patient-specific molecular mechanisms of disease, environmental impacts and potential therapeutic applications.</p>

        <p>Potential patients with specific genetic disease and healthy volunteers were informed of the project through poster advertising and referrals through patient advocacy and disease focus organizations (Parkinson's Institute). Written informed consent was obtained form all patients involved in the study. A Stanford institutional review board approved the primary cell line derivation (approval IRB-15028) and Stanford's stem cell research oversight committee (approval SCRO-212) approved all subsequent tissue use and experimentation. Potential donors were screened for men and women between the ages of 18 and 75 that had the genetically linked Parkinson's disease. After informed consent was obtained, primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) from the medial arm dermis of a 42-year-old male with SNCA triplication and his 46-year-old unaffected sister were obtained by first cleaning the region was cleaned with an alcohol swab and injecting 2&#x2013;3 ml of 1% lidocaine with 1&#x2236;100,000 diluted epinephrine. Then, a 4 mm dermal specimen was removed with a core punch biopsy instrument and placed in sterile PBS, while the skin defect was closed with a 4-0 nylon suture and covered with a double antibiotic ointment bandage. Sutures were removed after 2 weeks. The skin tissue biopsy was washed in Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> free Dulbecco PBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and minced into small pieces before being seeded onto gelatin coated 6-well cell culture flasks (Corning, Acton, MA) containing DMEM/F12 supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 &#xB5;g/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 10% FBS (DMEM/FBS culture media) and cultured at 37&#xB0;C37C in 5% CO2. A minimal amount of culture media was used to promote tissue attachment to the gelatin-coated surface (1 ml of culture media per well). The media was brought up to 4 ml per well once the skin fragments attached and the media was changed every 2 days. Once fibroblasts began to migrate out, the attached biopsy fragments and any connected epithelial cells were removed and the fibroblasts were cultured to 80&#x2013;90% confluence. This primary culture was passaged by brief exposure to 0.15% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and seeded into four gelatin-coated 175 cm cell culture flasks with fresh DMEM-F12/FBS culture media. These somatic cells were cultured until they reached 90% confluence and subsequently frozen in DMEM/FBS culture media supplemented with 10% dimethyyl sulphoxide (DMSO, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in aliquots of one million cells per cryovial. These somatic cells were thawed as required for reprogramming studies.</p>

Notably, DNMT3B (a denovo DNA methyltransferase) shows moderate silencing at the NSC stage, while expression returns upon further differentiation to DA neurons. Neural associated markers NCAM, TH, MAOA, MAOB and SNCA show higher expression as the differentiation proceeds towards DA neurons. The relative ratio of Robo2, Robo1 and DDC (axon guidance associated proteins) is shown as a fraction of their total expression between the three stages of differentiation - Trpl17 derived neurons appear to express a higher fraction of Robo1 against Robo2 and DDC than the control lines.</p>
