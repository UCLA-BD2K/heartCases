        <p>Atypical fibroxanthoma is an uncommon mesenchymal tumor that manifests clinically as
a reddish papule or nodule in sun-exposed areas of the body. The clinical
presentation is not specific and histology and immunohistochemistry are both
necessary for a correct diagnosis. Surgery is the gold standard of therapy.
Recurrence and metastasis should be excluded with a follow-up at 6 months, since this
tumor should nowadays be considered a medium-grade neoplasm, rather than low-grade as
previously believed. We report the case of two friends who came to our hospital
during the same period, complaining of very similar lesions. After biopsy and
immunohistochemical examination, a diagnosis of atypical fibroxanthoma in both cases
was formulated.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>AFX, also termed pseudosarcoma, paradoxical fibrosarcoma or pseudosarcomatous
reticulohistiocytoma, is an uncommon superficial fibrohistiocytic tumor. It occurs
mainly on sun-exposed skin of elderly individuals and shows a male predominance. The
lesion usually presents as an asymptomatic, solitary, often dome-shaped nodule, which
may be ulcerated. Histologically, AFX consists of an admixture of highly pleomorphic
spindle, epithelioid and multinucleated giant cells in the dermis.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The growth pattern of AFX has a
propensity of local invasion beyond the involved skin, thereby presenting the risk of
local recurrence after surgical excision, which is the gold standard of
treatment.<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 78-year-old healthy man was referred to our clinic due to the presence of a juicy-red,
dome-shaped nodule. The nodule, 1cm in diameter, appeared on the left antihelix appeared
approximately one year before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). Physical
examination revealed sun-damaged skin and a surgical scar due to previous excision of a
basal cell carcinoma.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>One week later, a friend of his (a 75-year-old man) came to our department with a
similar skin lesion. The nodule was oval-shaped, exophytic and bleeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>). It was located on the right helix and had
a diameter of 1.5cm. According to the patient, the lesion appeared about 2 months
beforehand and had been increasing in size.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="abd-90-04-0577-g02"/>
      </fig>
      <p>In both patients, we performed surgical removal of the lesions, suspecting basal cell
carcinomas. Histological examination showed similar findings in both samples such as
central erosion associated with pleomorphic spindle and epithelioid cell infiltration in
the context of a thickened vascularized stroma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure
3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">4</xref>). The proliferating cells were
CD68+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Figure 5</xref>), CD163+, FXIII+ and smooth muscle
actin+, while melanocytic markers (S100, melan-A, HMB45) were negative and melanoma was
therefore excluded. A final diagnosis of atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX) was made in both
cases, which was subsequently treated via surgical excision. The 6-month follow-up did
not reveal any new lesions in our patients.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>AFX is a rare, rapidly growing neoplasm of intermediate malignant potential.</p>
      <p>First described by Helwig<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> in 1961 as
a low-grade dermal tumor with atypical spindle cells, AFX is now generally considered an
intermediate malignant potential tumor with a low metastasize-grade<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The tumor usually presents as a pink or
red papule/nodule, associated or not with erythema and desquamation. Ulceration and
bleeding may be present. The tumor is usually skin-colored or brown-red, painless, firm
and frequently ulcerated<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Lesions are
smaller than 2cm in diameter, although the range may vary between 0.3-10 cm. No
characteristic dermatoscopic features have been described. Since clinical presentation
is not specific, histopathologic examination is essential for diagnosis.</p>
      <p>AFX is typically asymptomatic, unilesional and localized in sun-exposed areas (nose,
ears and lips) of elderly patients with a higher incidence in the seventh and eighth
decade of life<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The pathogenesis is commonly related to ultraviolet exposure. Several studies have
assessed a link to p53 protein and demonstrated signature mutations in the p53 gene,
occurring from UV radiation<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Moreover
x-ray exposure also seems to induce AFX development. A study conducted on 140 AFX cases
revealed that 4.2% of lesions had been developing on previous radiation sites<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>In comparison with typical fibroxanthoma, AFX usually occurs in older individuals (mean
age 69) with sun-damaged or radiation-damaged skin on the head, neck or scalp. Men are
distinctly more affected, representing between 2/3 and 3/4 of cases<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Differential diagnoses include
dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, spindle cell squamous carcinoma and spindle cell
malignant melanoma<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Histopathologic examination characteristically reveals a well-circumscribed, exophytic,
uncapsulated tumor located in the dermis. No extension to subcutaneous fat is usually
observed. The tumor consists of many atypical spindle and epithelioid cells with
pleomorphic vesicular or hyperchromatic nuclei. Atypical multinucleated giant cells and
mitoses are often seen. Histological characteristics associated with aggressive behavior
include involvement of larger portions of subcutis or deep soft tissues, vascular or
perineural invasion and the presence of necrosis. The main histological differential
diagnoses include spindle cell squamous carcinoma, melanoma and undifferentiated
pleomorphic sarcoma. The histological diagnosis of AFX is an exclusion diagnosis.
Immunohistochemistry is fundamental to properly diagnose AFX. CD68 and smooth muscle
actin are highly positive, while HMB45 and S100 protein are negative<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>AFX tumors usually have a benign clinical course. Surgical excision is the therapy of
choice. Wide excision with safety margins (1-2cm) is recommended as a first choice
treatment<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. In the rare
metastatic cases, treatment is patient individualized.</p>
      <p>Recurrence and metastasis occur rarely in incompletely excised tumors or when the
subcutis or deeper structures are involved and/or tumor necrosis or perineural-vascular
invasion is present. Since recurrences usually appear within months to 3 years after
primary excision, a clinical follow-up should be performed every 3-6 months over a
2-3-year period. Inspection and palpation of skin, lymph nodes and loco-regional skin,
in addition to lymph node sonography, are crucial studies<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.</p>
