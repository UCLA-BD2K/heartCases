      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Imaging technology in optical coherence tomography (OCT) has advanced rapidly and contributed greatly to progress in ophthalmology during this decade[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Improvement of OCT image quality has been achieved not only by increased retinal scan speed, as represented by the advancement of OCT generations from time-domain OCT to spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], but also by image processing techniques to reduce speckle noise using multiple-aligned OCT scans[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Although multiple B-scan averaging can visualize microstructure in OCT more clearly than single B-scans, this technique is based on high-speed SD-OCT scanning, by which B-scans are generated with minimal scanning distortion variation from one scan to another.</p>
      <p> More recently, confocal adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AO-SLO) has enabled imaging of retinal cells such as photoreceptors and blood cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Adaptive optics (AO) can compensate for aberrations in ocular optics, allowing clear visualization of individual cone photoreceptors in the living eye. As in OCT, multiple scan averaging has been reported as useful in AO-SLO imaging, with averaged AO-SLO images demonstrating photoreceptor microstructure more clearly than single scans[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, unlike SD-OCT, averaging of AO-SLO images is challenged by the relatively narrow and magnified scanning area. An interframe position gap produced by eye motion exists between scan frames, and intraframe eye motion produces distortions in frames[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, averaging often results in blurry images. To overcome these issues, hardware and software for eye tracking have been developed that can stabilize the frames, such as cross-correlation methods[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and the KLT (Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi)-SIFT (Scale-invariant feature transform) algorithm[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and excellent photoreceptor imaging results have been reported using these systems[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>In addition to photoreceptor observation, AO-SLO video allows noninvasive monitoring of the movement of blood components without contrast dyes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Noninvasive visualization of retinal capillaries using stabilized AO-SLO videos was very effective in analyzing the parafoveal capillary network of diabetic patients[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Because the technique requires no contrast dyes, angiogram can be safely obtained even in patients with minimal changes of that retina, which would be helpful in the early detection of retinal diseases and may also be a powerful tool for researching the pathogenic mechanisms of retinal diseases. Although the effect of video stabilization on vessel visualization was not analyzed in these studies, it was thought to be profound because the capillary image was constructed as a trajectory of small blood cells using multiple frames.</p>
      <p>In this study, we applied B-spline-based elastic image registration on AO-SLO videos to interpolate the images for AO-SLO video stabilization using public domain software ImageJ. B-splines have proven very useful in modeling deformations in many biomedical imaging problems and ensure high-quality interpolation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The effect of elastic image registration on AO-SLO-assisted capillary visualization in normal eyes and various retinal diseases was then evaluated objectively and subjectively.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and the Ethics Committee at Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine and performed in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant after a detailed explanation of the nature and possible consequences of the study procedures. </p>
      <sec id="s2.1">
        <title>Subjects</title>
        <p>Twenty-four healthy subjects with no history of ocular or systemic diseases (mean &#xB1; standard deviation [SD] age, 35.2 &#xB1; 8.1 y) and 25 patients (mean age &#xB1; SD, 56.7 &#xB1; 13.1 y) diagnosed with various eye diseases at Kyoto University Hospital (5 patients each with diabetic retinopathy [DR], idiopathic macular telangiectasia [MacTel], epiretinal membrane [ERM], central serous chorioretinopathy [CSC], and glaucoma) were recruited in this prospective cross-sectional study.</p>

        <title>Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy Imaging</title>
        <p>The AO-SLO system developed by Canon Inc. was employed for this study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], with 840-nm imaging light wavelength and 32-Hz frame rate. The imaging light exposure level was set to less than the maximum permissible exposure indicated by the American National Standards Institute[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The scan area at the retina was 2.8 &#xD7; 2.8&#xB0; and sampled at 400 &#xD7; 400 pixels. AO-SLO videos were acquired randomly from 1 eye of each subject after pupil dilation with one combined application of tropicamide (0.5%) and phenylephrine hydrochloride (0.5%) and recorded for 2 s per scan area; 6&#x2013;12 scan areas were collected per subject to cover the parafoveal area. AO-SLO imaging was focused on the photoreceptor layer to enable detection of moving bright objects in the capillaries, which may correspond to leukocytes or plasma gaps as described previously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2.3">
        <title>Video Processing</title>
        <p>Prior to linear and nonlinear registrations, all images were desinusoided in preprocessing to cancel the difference in reflective values between the center and near edge of each image caused by sinusoidal movement of the resonant scanner. </p>
        <sec id="s2.3.1">
          <title>Video Stabilization</title>
          <p>For each subject, a 2-s video was randomly chosen for analysis. All videos were first stabilized by linear image registration to align frames, followed by nonlinear image registration to correct image distortion produced by intraframe eye motion. The image quality of constructed capillary images was compared before and after nonlinear image registration. All digital images were processed by a single operator (A.U.) using ImageJ (developed by Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html</ext-link>). Grayscale ranged from 0 (black) to 255 (white).</p>

        <sec id="s2.3.2">
          <title>Linear Image Registration</title>
          <p>To align position gaps induced by eye motion across sequential frames, the Stackreg plug-in for ImageJ was used[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Stackreg is based on an automatic sub-pixel registration algorithm that minimizes the mean square difference of intensities between a reference image and source images. Rigid-body transformation, by which source images are transformed with translation and rotation to match a reference image while maintaining the distance between any pair of landmark points in the images, was applied to all videos. After registration, videos were cropped to eliminate the margin lacking a retinal image, which was a by-product of registration. </p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2.3.3">
          <title>Elastic (Nonlinear) Image Registration</title>
          <p>After linear image registration, videos were corrected for scanning distortions that were uncorrectable by linear registration and stabilized using the ImageJ plug-in bUnwarpJ, an algorithm for elastic and consistent image registration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080106-g001">Figure 1</xref> and the text of Digital Content S1, which describes the development of the bUnwarpJ algorithm as an ImageJ Plug-in in detail)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Deformation of bUnwarpJ was based on B-spline models, and the source image was elastically deformed in order to look as similar as possible to the target (reference) image. Because the bUnwarpJ plug-in was designed for registration between just 2 images and does not perform consecutive processing for registration between the reference image and other remaining frames, bUnwarpJ was run 63 times to analyze each 64-frame (2-s) video. We then created a macro that automates a series of ImageJ commands, and videos were registered automatically (Digital Content S2). Our macro was programmed to use the first frame as a fixed reference frame for image warping by bUnwarpJ.</p>

For each video processed by linear image registration, capillary visualization was performed both before and after elastic image registration, classified as the E(-) and E(+) groups, respectively, for comparison.

ROIs examined in this study consisted of a line selected on the vessel and areas selected in space surrounding the vessel.

Briefly, the line was established along a vessel shadow. Six 20 &#xD7; 20-pixel areas were selected adjacent to the selected capillary shadow on the cone mosaic pattern and then copied to the brightly visualized capillary image using ROI Manager, a built-in function of ImageJ that records the exact location of the ROIs, and the mean gray values of the selected capillary and vessel free space were calculated. CNR was calculated as follows:</p>

Comparison of the ratio of CNR values in the E(+) and E(-) groups and the mean score assigned by experts between patients and normal subjects was performed using one-way analysis of variance, with post-hoc comparisons tested by the Scheffe procedure. <italic>P</italic> values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

        <title>Effect of Elastic Registration on Capillary Visualization</title>
        <p>All AO-SLO videos tested in this study were successfully stabilized by elastic image registration with ImageJ, and distortion that was wavy and uncorrectable by linear image registration was considerably diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080106-g003">Figure 3</xref> and Digital Content S4). Bright moving objects in the shadows of capillaries on the cone mosaic pattern, considered to be leukocytes or plasma gaps, were easier to observe in stabilized videos than in videos only subjected to linear image registration.</p>

            <p>(A) Color fundus photograph of the right eye of a 34-year-old woman with no history of ocular or systemic diseases. (B, C) Two consecutive frames obtained by adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AO-SLO), which correspond to the area outlined in white in (A) showing scanning distortions that were uncorrectable by linear registration. High-intensity dots representing the cone mosaic pattern and dark shadow of the vessels are observed. Although the squares outlined by a dashed line in (B) and (C) indicate an identical area of the retina, the area in (B) appears to be wider than the area in (C). Scale bar, 100 &#x3BC;m. (D) Registered image of (C), which was elastically deformed to appear as similar as possible to (B). (E, F) Deformation grids on (B) and (C), respectively. (G) Capillary image constructed from unregistered AO-SLO video recorded for 2 s. (H) Capillary image constructed from AO-SLO video after B-spline-based elastic registration. The capillary is more brilliant than that of (G) constructed without registration.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we applied B-spline-based elastic registration to AO-SLO videos and demonstrated that the registration enhanced the quality of capillary images constructed from AO-SLO video both subjectively and objectively in normal eyes and eyes with various retinal diseases. CNRs for ROIs set on capillary visualized images were approximately twice as high in the E(+) group as in the E(-) group, and the mean score assigned by experts was 3.97 &#xB1; 0.70, suggesting that the registration played an important role in capillary visualization. Visualization of retinal capillaries using AO-SLO was very effective in analyzing microstructures such as microaneurysm and neovascularization, and it may be useful for early detection in patients with diabetes and other retinal vascular disorders[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The technique requires no contrast dyes, and angiograms can be obtained from the patient without adverse effects. Therefore, it enables frequent acquisition of capillary images from the same patient and may be useful in the evaluation of ophthalmologic or medical treatments in the future.</p>
      <p>Capillaries were visualized using motion contrast enhancement as previously reported[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Because the technique is based on calculating sequential division images, which are obtained by dividing the gray values of pixels between successive frames, precise registration is required to cancel the image of the mosaic pattern outside of the vessel shadow and extract only the motion of blood cells. In our protocol for capillary visualization, comparatively short (2-s) recording time and wide recording field (2.8 &#xD7; 2.8&#xB0;) were adopted to minimize the inter-frame position gap between scan frames produced by eye motion. Although the protocol was also convenient for simultaneous acquisition of the wide-field capillary network, inadequate registration would fail to cancel the background mosaic pattern by pixel and result in spotty areas on the image as in the example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080106-g008">Figure 8</xref>. </p>
      <p> B-spline-based deformation models are control grids composed of B-spline curves, which are smooth curves defined by the given control points[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Using the deformation models, pixels in an image from AO-SLO video can be matched to pixels on the reference image to obtain interpolated images warped by a spline function. B-spline-based elastic image registrations have been utilized widely in many biomedical imaging problems and have proven suitable for the type of deformations encountered with magnetic resonance imaging[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Other than the registration method applied here, several approaches have been reported to date. Arathorn et al. reported cross-correlation methods, whereby the frames were cut in rectangles and displaced in the x and y directions to correlate them to a reference frame[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Since the distortions created by intraframe eye motion are mainly due to the raster pattern of scanning, which is relatively slower than scanning line, breaking up the frames into strips parallel to the fast scanning mirror direction is reasonable. In fact, our results on the processing time required for elastic image registration support the adequacy of cross-correlation methods. The mean processing time was correlated with the width but not vertical length of cropped videos, suggesting that many more distortions are present in the horizontal direction, which is perpendicular to the fast scanning mirror direction in our system, than in the vertical. In the KLT-SIFT algorithm[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], stable point features were extracted from AO-SLO images using the SIFT algorithm[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and features were tracked from frame to frame using the KLT algorithm, which has low computational complexity and is considered faster than traditional techniques[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], followed by second-order polynomial transformation to remove distortions. Using KLT-SIFT, features on 30-Hz AO-SLO video can be tracked in real-time. </p>
      <p>Mean processing time required for elastic image registration was approximately 20 s per frame in this study. Compared to the 2 above-mentioned registration methods, which can compute registration on a millisecond time scale per frame, the registration method tested here required substantial computing time. Although our goal is not to track single cones or stabilized stimulus delivery to the living retina in real-time, 10-min processing time to register a 2-s video is considered to be too long for applying the method widely to future investigations of AO-SLO-assisted blood flow analysis. The use of general-purpose software and the consistent image registration that is included in the energy function of the registration software appeared to factor in the long processing time. However, putting aside the issue of processing time, B-spline-based elastic image registration provides high-quality interpolation because of its precise pixel-wise registration and enables capillary visualization constructed from short-term recording. Development of special tools to integrate software, applications, and systems from different vendors may improve availability and speed.</p>
      <p>Public domain software ImageJ and associated plug-ins were used for image processing including image registration and capillary visualization in the current study based on their ready availability[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Anyone wishing to try the registration and capillary visualization described here need only download the software and macro texts. Currently, AO-SLO machines are being developed by researchers in many countries, and more groups will participate in this new area of research in the future. We believe that the information described in this paper will support the quick initiation of research on AO-SLO-assisted blood flow analysis, which will in turn facilitate investigations of retinal microcirculation. Using B-spline-based elastic image registration, capillaries were visualized well without contrast dyes, similar to FA, in all diseased eyes except cases of ERM and CSC. In ERM, vessel images overlapping with &#x201C;microfolds&#x201D; were obscured by white cloud-like artifacts[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In CSC, vessel shadows near the fovea assimilated into the dark area and were not visible[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Ultimately, capillaries in these areas could not be visualized. Because AO-SLO was focused on the photoreceptor layer and blood cells were observed as shadings on the shadows of the bright cone mosaic patterns of photoreceptors, this focusing may be the cause of these artifacts and loss of capillary images[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. As previously described, the characteristics of the reflected AO-SLO laser from photoreceptors are affected by blood cells because of their different scattering coefficients[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. When the scanning is focused on the photoreceptor layer, leukocytes and blood plasma are candidates for the bright particles moving in the dark vessel shadows due to the low absorptivity of the AO-SLO laser, and erythrocytes are candidates for the region that is darker than the vessel shadow because they block the AO-SLO lasers. Accordingly, the presence of structures that can block the laser or absences of photoreceptors that can reflect the laser as in the case of microfolds and loss of cone mosaic pattern will lead to the failure of blood flow detection. Although a possible solution to the problem may be focusing the scanning layer on the capillary layer, further investigation is needed to assess the optimal focus for capillary visualization using AO-SLO.</p>
      <p>Our study has several limitations: (1) Because the registration was computed after video recording without real time eye-tracking, video recording was limited to a short duration to minimize the inter-frame position gap between scan frames. Longer-duration video recording may fail to construct adequately wide-area capillary images (2). The first frame of the video was used as a fixed reference frame for image warping. Because the reference frame itself can contain substantial distortions produced by intraframe eye movement, subsequent source frames and constructed capillary images will contain the same distortions. To overcome this issue, registration methods may be altered in the future to adopt a method based on analysis of eye movement, which has the potential to select a reference frame with minimum distortion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p>
      <p>In conclusion, use of B-spline-based elastic image registration in AO-SLO-assisted capillary visualization was found to be both objectively and subjectively effective for enhancing image quality. Its high-quality interpolation and ready availability may further facilitate the application of AO-SLO for the study of retinal microcirculation.</p>
