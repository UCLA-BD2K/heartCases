        <p id="P3">Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is fundamentally important for tissue homeostasis through EGFR/ligand interactions that stimulate numerous signal transduction pathways. Aberrant EGFR signaling has been reported in inflammatory and malignant diseases but thus far no primary inherited defects in EGFR have been recorded. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous loss-of-function missense mutation in <italic>EGFR</italic> (c.1283G&gt;A; p.Gly428Asp) in a male infant with life-long inflammation affecting the skin, bowel and lungs. During the first year of life, his skin showed erosions, dry scale, and alopecia. Subsequently, there were numerous papules and pustules &#x2013; similar to the rash seen in patients receiving EGFR inhibitor drugs. Skin biopsy demonstrated an altered cellular distribution of EGFR in the epidermis with reduced cell membrane labeling, and <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis of the mutant receptor revealed abrogated EGFR phosphorylation and EGF-stimulated downstream signaling. Microarray analysis on the patient&#x2019;s skin highlighted disturbed differentiation/premature terminal differentiation of keratinocytes and upregulation of several inflammatory/innate immune response networks. The boy died aged 2.5 years from extensive skin and chest infections as well as electrolyte imbalance. This case highlights the major mechanism of epithelial dysfunction following EGFR signaling ablation and illustrates the broader impact of EGFR inhibition on other tissues.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p id="P4">EGFR signaling represents a key activity in several biologic processes underpinning tissue development and homeostasis (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Jutten and Rouschop, 2014</xref>). Thus far, 7 EGFR ligands have been identified: EGF, transforming growth factor-&#x3B1;, amphiregulin, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, betacellulin, epiregulin, and epigen (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Schneider and Wolf, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Nanba <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Interaction between EGFR and these ligands leads to stimulation of numerous transduction pathways that includes the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PLC-gamma/PKC, PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, and NF-&#x3BA;B cascades (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Jost <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; Silbilia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007). Acquired abnormalities of EGFR signaling have been observed in various inflammatory and malignant diseases (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Jost <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Gschwind <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Dreux <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Of note, aberrant EGFR activation is found in many tumor cells, and humanized neutralizing antibodies and synthetic small compounds against EGFR are in clinical use today. These drugs may cause skin and hair toxicities, indicating a key role for EGFR in cutaneous homeostasis (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Lacouture, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). These side-effects have been recapitulated in a mouse model, with evident abnormalities in cutaneous chemokines associated with early infiltration of macrophages and mast cells and later infiltration of eosinophils, T cells and neutrophils (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Mascia <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations in tumors are typically gain-of-function and located within the tyrosine kinase domain of the protein, but thus far there are no reports of naturally occurring loss-of-function mutations in humans. Knockout and transgenic murine models and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated the essential role of EGFR in multiple organs (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Miettinen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; Silbia and Wagner, 1995; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Threadgill <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Jost <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Schneider <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), but clinical correlates in patients are currently lacking. In this study, we used whole-exome sequencing to identify an inherited loss-of-function mutation in <italic>EGFR</italic> in an individual with inflammatory skin, lung and bowel disease.</p>

        <title>Clinical presentation with cutaneous erosions and inflammation</title>
        <p id="P5">We investigated a male infant born to parents of Polish Roma origin who presented to us at 12 months of age with extensive skin inflammation. Initially, there were widespread erosions affecting his trunk and limbs that had been present since birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>), but subsequently we observed papules and pustules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). He also had life-long watery diarrhea and respiratory difficulties. He was born at 34 weeks&#x2019; gestation, weighing 1560 grams; the pregnancy had been complicated by polyhydramnios and maternal hypertension. Clinically, at 12 months his weight was only 5.52kg with evident failure to thrive. His inflamed skin was frequently infected with <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. He had loss of scalp hair but long eyelashes (trichomegaly). No nail abnormalities were observed. He had previously undergone surgery for probable coarctation of the aorta and was noted to be hypertensive. Other abnormalities included recurrent bronchiolitis and pulmonary infection with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (requiring tracheostomy and oxygen). Renal ultrasound showed bilateral renal enlargement but no obstruction. The child had no specific food allergies but was unable to tolerate solids due to diarrhea and vomiting and severe dehydration. We observed low albumin, zinc, vitamin A, iron, magnesium, profound hypokalaemia (persistent), and hypernatraemia - though barium meal showed no evidence of malabsorption. He preferred to drink water rather than milk and subsequently required total parenteral nutrition. Blood eosinophil counts were slightly elevated during the first year (observed levels 0.4-1.0 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup>/l). Total IgE was found to be raised as a neonate (100 IU/l; range for &lt;1 year 0-15 IU/l) and at 15 months (107 IU/l; range for this age 0-60 IU/l). IgM was borderline normal/low; IgG and IgA were normal. Venous access lines frequently became clotted and he developed deep vein thromboses. He died aged 2.5 years as a result of cutaneous and pulmonary infections and electrolyte imbalance. Further details of the clinical history can be found in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material</xref>.</p>

        <title>Skin biopsy reveals acanthosis and intra-epidermal edema</title>
        <p id="P6">We obtained written informed consent from the subject&#x2019;s legal guardian with approval from the St. Thomas&#x2019; Hospital Ethics Committee. Elliptical skin biopsies were obtained under local anesthetic from a non-lesional area on the right thigh of the child (aged 12 months) as well as the abdomens of healthy control patients undergoing cosmetic (&#x201C;tummy tuck&#x201D;) surgery. The initial clinical diagnosis was a subtype of inherited skin fragility, a heterogeneous group of disorders known collectively as epidermolysis bullosa (EB) (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Fine <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Light microscopy of non-lesional skin revealed mild acanthosis compared to age- and site-matched control skin, as well as a slight widening between adjacent keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). A few neutrophils were noted within the superficial dermis with some infiltration of follicular epithelium and folliculitis, although Gram stain for bacteria was negative. The changes within the epidermis resembled those of a primary inherited abnormality of desmosomes (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Petrof <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), although transmission electron microscopy showed intercellular edema from the basal layer to the mid-spinous layer and a slight decrease in the number of gap junctions but no structural or numerical abnormalities in hemidesmosome or desmosome cell junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). Skin immunolabeling using a panel of antibodies that target basement membrane and epidermal proteins implicated in inherited skin fragility disorders (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material</xref> for antibody details) demonstrated a marked reduction in staining intensity for the desmosomal proteins desmoglein 1 and plakophilin 1, as well as altered labeling patterns for profilaggrin, involucrin and keratin 10, markers of terminal differential in the epidermis (illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material</xref>). Some of the clinicopathologic features also resembled Netherton syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder associated with loss-of-function mutations in a serine protease inhibitor (<italic>SPINK5</italic>) that encodes lympho-epithelial Kazal-type related inhibitor (LEKT1) (Chavavas <italic>et al</italic>., 2000; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Stoll <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>).

        <p id="P7">Next, after obtaining approval from the ethics committee and informed consent, we extracted genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples from the child, other family members and controls in compliance with the Helsinki Guidelines. Using the patient&#x2019;s DNA, whole-exome sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 (San Diego, CA, USA). After excluding pathogenic mutations in genes implicated in different forms of EB (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Fine <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), the exome variant profile was filtered to look for novel homozygous mutations (based on probable consanguinity). This disclosed 6 possible gene mutations (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material</xref>). Within these genes, <italic>EGFR</italic> was deemed to be of potential relevance given that some clinical features (e.g. papulo-pustular skin eruptions, alopecia and trichomegaly) resembled known side-effects of EGFR inhibitor drugs (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Lacouture, 2006</xref>). Immunofluorescence microscopy to assess EGFR expression in the affected infant&#x2019;s skin showed a markedly altered staining pattern with loss of the cell peripheral membrane labeling and a more cytoplasmic or peri-nuclear region distribution, compared to strong cell membrane localization of EGFR throughout the epidermis, with minimal intracellular labeling, in control skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). The non-synonymous substitution identified in exon 11 of <italic>EGFR</italic>, c.1283G&gt;A, replaces a neutral glycine with a negatively charged aspartic acid molecule at a highly conserved residue, p.Gly428Asp. The pathogenicity of this missense mutation was supported by both the &#x2018;Sorts Intolerant From Tolerant&#x2019; (SIFT; score 0, probably damaging) and Polymorphism Phenotyping v2 (polyphen-2; score 1, probably damaging) programs (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Ng and Henikoff, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Adzhubei <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).

        <p id="P8">Microarray data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus repository; accession number GSE54162. Comparison of the affected infant&#x2019;s skin with healthy control skin identified 2-fold or greater differential expression for 2,157 gene transcripts: 1004 up-regulated and 1153 down-regulated. These genes did not include <italic>EGFR</italic>, which was insignificantly up-regulated in the patient&#x2019;s skin (fold change=1.36; p=0.012). Evaluation of the changes in gene expression by functional enrichment analysis identified a multitude of enriched gene ontology (GO) pathways, processes, networks and disease-associated transcripts germane to EGFR signaling (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials</xref> for tabulated results). The top 3 up-regulated GO processes were linked to known EGFR functionality: keratinocyte differentiation, keratinization and epidermis development (involving genes such as transglutaminases, small proline rich genes, S100 genes, involucrin and late cornified envelope genes). Reports have also indicated a role for EGFR in regulating skin inflammation and cutaneous defence (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Lichtenberger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Mascia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Thus, innate inflammatory response gene components (specifically PLA2, NF-&#x3BA;B, and JNK1) were among the most significantly up-regulated GO networks.

        <title>Mutant EGFR at the plasma membrane is highly unstable and more susceptible to constitutive endocytosis</title>
        <p id="P9">To determine whether the mutation p.Gly428Asp in <italic>EGFR</italic> was responsible for mislocalization of EGFR in the affected infant, we generated DNA constructs containing mutant or wild-type <italic>EGFR</italic> sequence linked to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and expressed these constructs in MCF7 cells that express low endogenous EGFR and analyzed EGF-dependent localization of EGFR using confocal microscopy. Under normal growth conditions, the mutant <italic>EGFR</italic> construct localized diffusely throughout the cytoplasm of the cell in contrast to the wild-type construct, which was present mostly on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). EGF stimulation resulted in robust translocation of wild-type EGFR to the plasma membrane within 10 minutes of EGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). Conversely, the mutant EGFR remained in the cytoplasm following EGF stimulation with no clear recruitment to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>), suggesting this mutation prevents or diminishes EGFR membrane localization, supporting the immunostaining findings in patient skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P10">EGFR membrane localization is regulated through a balance of endocytosis under the control of a number of intracellular signaling pathways that converge on the large GTPase dynamin (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). To examine whether the lack of mutant EGFR localization to the cell membrane was due to defective endocytic traffic, MCF-7 cells expressing either wild-type or mutant EGFR were treated with an inhibitor of dynamin-mediated endocytosis, Dynasore (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Macia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Receptor localization was then examined by confocal microscopy. In the absence of ligand, membrane localization of both wild-type and mutant EGFR increased after treatment with Dynasore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). Similar results were observed in a normal human keratinocyte cell line expressing wild-type or mutant EGFR (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material</xref>). Immunostaining of MCF-7 cells expressing wild-type or mutant EGFR was performed using an antibody against the extracellular domain of EGFR to quantify membrane localization. Pearson&#x2019;s correlation coefficient analysis to quantify the co-localization between wild-type or mutant EGFR with the antibody staining demonstrated that for both constructs the EGFR membrane localization increased significantly following Dynasore treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>) but not following treatment with the chemical chaperone 4-PBA (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the mutant EGFR is able to undergo recycling to the plasma membrane but that it can only be retained at the membrane upon blockade of endocytic signaling. This suggests that the mutation p.Gly428Asp renders EGFR at the plasma membrane highly unstable and thus more susceptible to constitutive endocytosis.</p>

        <title>Loss of downstream Akt and ERK signaling associated with mutant EGFR</title>
        <p id="P11">Following EGF binding, EGFR undergoes rapid autophosphorylation and activation at a number of residues within the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. These changes result in recruitment of a host of initiators and scaffolds of signaling leading to activation of MAP kinase family members including ERK (p44/42) and Akt (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Avraham and Yarden, 2011</xref>). We therefore assessed the effect of the mutation p.Gly428Asp on EGF dependent phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream signaling. EGF-dependent ERK and Akt activation were assessed in untransfected MCF-7 cells or those expressing wild-type or mutant EGFR. EGF-stimulated activation of EGFR (monitored by a phospho-specific antibody) was robust in the cells expressing wild-type EGFR, but was undetectable in the mutant EGFR-expressing cells above levels seen in untransfected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). Similarly, neither Akt nor ERK activation was detected following ligand binding in mutant EGFR-expressing cells, in contrast to cells expressing wild-type EGFR which showed robust EGF-stimulated EGFR, ERK and Akt phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). We observed similar results in parallel experiments in another cell line (CHO-K1 cells) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material</xref> for data).</p>
        <p id="P12">The suppression of EGFR-dependent activation and downstream signaling observed suggests that the EGFR mutation p.Gly428Asp results in loss-of-function as well as loss of plasma membrane localization. One of the primary functions of EGFR signaling following EGF binding is to promote cell proliferation (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Jost <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). To determine whether the loss of EGF-dependent signaling in p.Gly428Asp mutant EGFR-expressing cells results in functional defects, proliferation was analyzed in CHO-K1 cells expressing the wild-type or mutant EGFR constructs. EGF and serum-stimulated proliferation was induced in CHO-K1 cells expressing wild-type EGFR, but no induction of cell growth was detected in cells expressing the mutant EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). Indeed, there was a negative growth rate of the mutant EGFR-expressing cells, consistent with other work showing inhibition of EGFR signaling induces apoptosis in keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>) (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Rodeck <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>).</p>

        <title>Clinicopathologic overlap with patients harboring mutations in <italic>ADAM17</italic></title>
        <p id="P13">The exact mechanism by which the missense mutation p.Gly428Asp leads to loss of EGFR function is unclear. Mutagenesis of the adjacent amino acid (p.Arg429Glu) was previously found to prevent EGFR homo-dimerization through disruption of an interface between domains II and III of the protein (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Dawson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). However, altered homo-dimerization would not provide a sufficient explanation for the pathology as both monomeric EGFR and the p.Arg429Glu mutant were present at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Ogiso <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In our experiments, we found that inhibition of endocytosis promoted levels of mutant EGFR at the cell surface. We hypothesize that the mutant receptor is unstable and rapidly undergoes internalization from the plasma membrane, perhaps implicating altered intracellular protein binding and subsequent aberrant tethering within membrane microdomains.</p>
        <p id="P14">Functionally, failure of EGFR to correctly localize to cell membrane is expected to reduce ligand binding. In healthy people, several ligands require proteolytic cleavage to become capable of binding to EGFR &#x2013; this ectodomain shedding is induced by at least 5 different metalloprotease enzymes, including ADAM17 (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Blobel, 2005</xref>) &#x2013; mutations in which may underlie an inflammatory skin and bowel disease that has overlap with the clinical features present in our patient (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Blaydon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). We hypothesize that the lack of EGFR localization at the cell membrane in our patient has some similarity at a signaling level to that which occurs in the ADAM17-deficient patients, i.e. a common failure of EGFR-ligand interaction and altered downstream signal transduction.</p>

Although the phenotype of <italic>Egfr</italic>-deficient mice depends on the strain of the mice (several are embryonic lethal), the abnormalities in the skin, lung and bowel in surviving mice are similar to many of the clinical manifestations in our patient. In the epidermis, some knockout mice show an initially thin skin that then becomes thicker but with defective barrier function (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Miettinen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). Lack of <italic>Egfr</italic> in mice also affects hair growth, with wavy or reduced hair growth; EGFR is essential for normal hair follicle progression through the anagen, catagen, and telogen phases of the hair growth cycle (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Hansen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Schneider <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). EGFR initiates hair growth and hair follicle organization, and EGFR inhibition leads to inflammation, follicular necrosis and alopecia, as well as slow hair growth with brittle hairs, as observed in our patient (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Hansen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Schneider <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). <italic>Egfr</italic>-deficient mouse lungs show condensed collapsed alveoli with a lack of surfactant leading to respiratory difficulty that has been likened to human neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Miettinen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). In murine bowel lacking Egfr, there are fewer, shorter intestinal villi and reduced proliferation of jejunal enterocytes, leading to fluid loss (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Miettinen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). Other abnormalities noted in the mice that show phenotypic similarities to our patient have included cystic dilatation of the collecting ducts in the kidneys (indicating that EGFR is vital for the differentiation of structures derived from the ureteric bud), aortic narrowing and a thrombotic tendency (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Miettinen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>).

        <p id="P16">The clinical manifestations in the child homozygous for p.Gly428Asp in <italic>EGFR</italic> also show some resemblance to the side-effect profile in individuals taking EGFR inhibitors. The side-effects of these drugs include a distinctive acne-like rash with pustules, dry skin, alopecia, trichomegaly, as well as mucositis, diarrhea, and, in rare instances, interstitial lung disease (Inoue <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Lacouture, 2006</xref>). All these clinical features were evident to some degree in our patient. Nevertheless, although skin papules and pustules developed during disease progression in our case, the early skin changes mostly consisted of erosions (which led to the erroneous initial clinical diagnosis of EB). EGFR signaling is known to be involved in the re-epithelialization phase of wound healing (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Repertinger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Pastore <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), as well as the proliferation of keratinocyte stem cells (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Jensen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), and we hypothesize that the missense mutation in our patient impeded these processes and was the primary cause of the erosive skin changes, with bacterial super-infection being a secondary contributing factor. The transcriptomic data from our patient illustrate the consequences of impaired EGFR signaling. The results (albeit based on RNA extracted from non-inflamed skin) reveal enhanced pro-inflammatory activation and disturbed differentiation/premature terminal differentiation of keratinocytes as key pathogenic mechanisms, thereby demonstrating a similar profile to that associated with the papulopustular rash associated with EGFR inhibitory drugs (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Lacouture, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Lichtenberger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Mascia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Notably, several inflammatory/innate response networks were significantly up-regulated, including NF-&#x3BA;B.</p>
        <p id="P17">In conclusion, the EGFR network is one of the most influential and intricate signaling systems in biology. We believe the protean features in our patient offer clinical insight into the critical and diverse roles of EGFR, supporting many of the putative functions that have been ascribed to the receptor via murine models and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. This case highlights the major mechanism of epithelial dysfunction following EGFR signaling ablation and illustrates the broader impact of EGFR inhibition on other tissues that might be under-appreciated in the context of concurrent malignancy in patients receiving EGFR inhibitor medications.</p>

        <title>The mutation in <italic>EGFR</italic> reduces signal transduction and cell proliferation</title>
        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Western blotting was performed for p-EGFR, EGFR, p-ERK, ERK, p-Akt and Akt on lysates from untransfected (U), wild-type EGFR (WT) or mutant EGFR (MUT) transfected MCF-7 cells after EGF stimulation for the indicated times. MCF-7 cells express very low endogenous EGFR and therefore EGFR is undetectable in UT cells. Arrows indicate phospho and total EGFR species in top and second row blots respectively. Note the higher molecular weight species of EGFR in the WT samples in the second row blot are phosphorylated receptor and directly correlate with phosphorylated EGFR as detected in the top row blot. (<bold>b</bold>) Cell proliferation was quantified in CHO-K1 cells transfected with GFP, wild-type EGFR-GFP or mutant EGFR-GFP in starved (&#x2212;), normal growth (10% fetal calf serum) or EGF-stimulated (EGF) conditions. (<bold>c</bold>) GFP-positive cells were counted and normalized against total cell number, and the cell growth rate was then calculated from these data.</p>
