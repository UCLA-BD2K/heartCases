          <title>Background:</title>
          <p>The intrauterine device (IUD) was a very common form of birth control in the United States. The most serious potential complication of IUD use is uterine perforation. Uterine perforation is common among women with &#x201C;lost&#x201D; IUDs and can cause severe morbidity and mortality and should be carefully managed. The recommended treatment is removal of the perforating IUD. This can usually be managed laparoscopically unless bowel perforation or other severe sepsis is present.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Methods:</title>
          <p>An intra-abdominal IUD was removed laparoscopically from the perirectal fat of a 49-year-old women who had been diagnosed over 20 years earlier with an &#x201C;expelled&#x201D; IUD.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions:</title>
          <p>It is important that the possibility of uterine perforation be considered in anyone who has had a diagnosis of an expelled IUD without actual confirmation that the IUD is no longer present in the body. In any woman who presents with pelvic pain and a history of a &#x201C;lost&#x201D; IUD, the surgeon should have a high index of suspicion and obtain radiological studies. It may be advisable to question women about possible IUD use when they present with pelvic pain of unknown origin.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The intrauterine device (IUD) has fallen out of favor in the United States, with less than one percent of American women now using an IUD for contraception.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref></sup> However, in the 70s and early 80s, IUDs were in frequent use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup> Since patients depend on medical personnel for removal of this contraceptive device, there are probably a number of women who still may have IUDs in place.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup> In the absence of the sexually transmitted agents of salpingitis, IUDs are very safe and effective contraceptives, with rare complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Probably the most severe complication of IUD use is uterine perforation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup> It is common among women who have &#x201C;lost&#x201D; an IUD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup> Most of the time, such perforations are painless and benign.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref></sup> However, they can cause severe morbidity and mortality and, therefore, should be actively managed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></sup> Unfortunately, expulsion is often the diagnosis when the IUD string is not visible without careful determination of what has actually happened to the IUD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref></sup> A perforated IUD can remain in the abdomen for years until the onset of more serious symptoms occurs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The recommended treatment for perforation of the uterus by an IUD is removal of the IUD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup> This can usually be managed laparoscopically unless bowel perforation or other severe sepsis is present.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup></p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 49-year-old gravida 5 para 3 abortus 2 woman presented with severe chronic pelvic pain and deep dyspareunia. She gave no history of IUD use. Endometriosis or pelvic adhesive disease were suspected. Exploratory laparoscopy was performed. No evidence of endometriosis was found, and the uterus, ovaries and tubes were within normal limits. Adhesions were found in the right upper quadrant, presumably from a previous cholecystectomy. The rectosigmoid colon was found to be adherent to the cul-de-sac. When those adhesions were separated, an intrauterine device of the Lippes Loop type was found imbedded in the perirectal fat <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>)</bold>. It was dissected free and removed <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>)</bold>. There was no evidence of damage to the rectum. The patient recovered well and was free of pain.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Postoperatively, further history was obtained from the patient. She recalled having an IUD placed approximately 25 years previously. She also remembered that she had experienced severe pain on insertion of the IUD. She had gone to a different doctor a week later and had been told that she must have expelled the device. Unfortunately, these records could not be obtained. However, the first incidence of right lower quadrant and pelvic pain of unknown origin listed in the patient's available records occurred 21 years before the surgery, several years after she estimated that her IUD was placed.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The IUD was a prevalent form of birth control in the United States and is still frequently used in other countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup> Its use has declined in the United States in part because of litigation surrounding a specific IUD, the Dalkon Shield; this IUD had a strong association with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), thought to be due to its multifilament tail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup> However, the newer IUDs are not associated with PID in the absence of sexually transmitted agents and are an effective form of birth control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup> They are relatively inexpensive per unit time and require minimal compliance by the patient to remain effective.</p>
      <p>They are also long term and reversible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup> Most importantly, they are one of the most effective methods of preventing unwanted pregnancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup> However, they do not protect the user from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup> They are generally safe, with few serious complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup> However, uterine perforation remains a complication with the potential to be very serious.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Uterine perforation is an uncommonly reported complication of IUD use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref></sup> When IUD types have been compared, no significant difference was found between rates of perforation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref></sup> The general incidence of perforation for all types has been estimated at 1.2/1000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref></sup> Uterine perforation most often is symptomless and is first suspected when the woman presents with unintended pregnancy or for removal of the IUD, and the strings cannot be located.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref></sup> It is speculated that most perforations occur at the time of insertion, although some have proposed that perforations can arise secondarily as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref></sup> Most investigators believe, however, that the perforation must at least start at insertion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Most perforations, fortunately, are uncomplicated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref></sup> However, adjacent organs may become involved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup> If bowel strangulation and perforation occurs, the situation can quickly become life-threatening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup> Displaced IUDs have been known to penetrate the different organs of the pelvis, with the most commonly reported site of perforation being the colon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref></sup> The bladder and the small bowel are other sites of perforation that can be life threatening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Very often in the past, a missing IUD string was simply diagnosed as an unnoticed expulsion, and no further follow-up was done.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref></sup> Every case of missing IUD strings should be carefully followed up to exclude perforation as the cause, and the diagnosis of expulsion should never be made unless the physician has physical evidence (ie, the actual IUD, or a film showing no evidence of an IUD within the body) that the IUD is no longer present in the body.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref></sup> If this had been standard practice, some severe complications may have been prevented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In our case, greater than 20 years elapsed from the time the patient was diagnosed with expulsion and her treatment. A long duration of time between evidence of perforation and development of significant symptoms is not uncommon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref></sup> Because IUDs can be loose in the pelvis for long periods without causing complications, and often cause no complications at all, in the past, it has been recommended that open IUDs not be removed unless complications ensue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup> However, more recently, the recommendation has been made that all perforated IUDs should be removed because of the severe morbidity and mortality that late complications may cause.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In this particular case, since there was no history of a lost IUD prior to the laparoscopy for pelvic pain, no specific evaluation for a &#x201C;lost&#x201D; IUD was undertaken. The usual evaluation for a patient presenting with nonvisible or nonpalpable IUD strings is to first probe the endocervical canal to see if the strings can be brought down with a cotton-tipped applicator. If there has been missed or irregular menses, a pregnancy test should be done. If the strings cannot be brought down, in most cases pelvic ultrasound will identify the IUD in the endometrial cavity. If there is a question as to whether the IUD is partially embedded in the uterine wall, sonohysterography or hysteroscopy may be performed next. If, however, ultrasound is unsuccessful in locating the IUD, a flat plate and upright of the abdomen should be performed to look for an extrauterine location of the IUD. In the case of an extrauterine IUD, surgical removal is indicated. In removing an embedded IUD from the endometrial cavity with a grasping instrument or by hysteroscopy, prophylactic antibiotics should be considered. Also, when doing a laparoscopy for an intra-abdominal IUD, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended.</p>

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <p>In this case, it is possible that the patient may have been saved many years of pain if the perforation had been diagnosed at the time it occurred. It is important that the possibility of uterine perforation be considered in anyone who has had a diagnosis of an expelled IUD without actual confirmation that the IUD is no longer present in the body. In any woman who presents with pelvic pain and a history of a &#x201C;lost&#x201D; IUD, the surgeon should have a high index of suspicion and obtain radiological studies. It may be advisable to question women about possible IUD use when presenting with pelvic pain of unknown origin.</p>
