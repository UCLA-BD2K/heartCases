  <body>
    <p>Endogenous infection of the globe is rare in an immunocompetent
patient. Identification of the organism is quite important in the
management of such patients. Histopathological examination
with special stain can identify the etiological agent. However,
identification of the species is not possible from histopathological
examination.</p>
    <p>We report a case of endogenous endophthalmitis in an
eight-month-old child. The histopathological examination of
the enucleated globe revealed granulomatous inflammation and
subsequent staining by Gomori&#x2032;s methanamine silver staining
revealed the presence of multiple fungal filaments in the globe.
As the species identification was not possible by histology,
nucleic acid based amplification method of Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR) targeting Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS)
region was applied on the tissue sections. PCR detected the
presence of fungal genome in the tissue specimen. However, to
characterize the fungus, the technique of PCR-based restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) using <italic>Hae</italic> -III enzyme
was applied on the ITS amplified products. PCR based RFLP
revealed a cleavage pattern similar to that of <italic>Aspergillus
fumigatus</italic>.</p>

      <title>Case History</title>
      <p>An eight-month-old male child was brought by his parents in
March 2006. The child had history of severe cough four months
ago. Subsequently, he developed severe redness, watering
and discharge in the right eye. His birth history revealed the
child was a full-term normal delivery. There was no history of
prenatal infection.</p>
      <p>The child could not fixate or follow light with right eye
whereas the left eye could fixate and follow the light. Right eye
had conjunctival congestion, hazy cornea, an exudative mass
in the anterior chamber. There was iris atrophy. Intraocular
pressure was low in the right eye and normal in the left
eye digitally. Fundus examination revealed no view in the
right eye. Ultrasonography of the right eye showed vitreous
cavity filled with moderately reflective dot echoes. There
was no evidence of intraocular calcification. Choroid was
grossly thickened (3.0 mm). No mass lesion or intraocular
foreign body was seen. Axial length of the eyeball was 13.3
mm. Computerized tomography (CT) scan showed the right
globe smaller in size with hyperdense vitreous without any
calcification. Ultrasound and CT scan finding was suggestive
of endophthalmitis in the right eye. Left eye was normal in
all aspects.</p>
      <p>As there was no visual potential, the right eye was
enucleated. The globe measured 12 mm anteroposteriorly, 13
mm horizontally and 12 mm vertically. Cross-section showed
shrunken globe with disorganized internal structure. Choroid
and sclera were thickened. Optic nerve head could not be seen.
Central callote was submitted for histopathological examination
which showed a shrunken eyeball with thickening of the sclera
[<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>]. Sclera was infiltrated by inflammatory cells at the limbus,
which was composed of lymphocytes and multiple histiocytes.
Iris showed dense infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells
and histiocytes. Lens was found to be shrunken with ruptured
and folded lens capsule. Vitreous cavity showed extensive
granulomatous inflammation with multiple Langerhan&#x2032;s giant
cells. Retina could not be identified. Histopathological diagnosis
was consistent with endophthalmitis. Special stains for the
fungus by Gomori methenamine silver stain showed multiple
septate fungi with 90&#xB0; branching suggestive of <italic>Aspergillus
species</italic> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>]. The PCR-based RFLP for species identification
revealed a cleavage pattern similar to <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>
[<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3</xref>]. Child was examined by an internist. There was no
evidence of systemic involvement due to <italic>Aspergillus</italic> infection.
No risk factor, intake of oral steroid or immunosuppressive
agent and malignancy was found. The child was doing well
after six months.</p>

        <p>DNA extraction from paraffin section was carried out by
Qiamp kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to manufacturer&#x2032;s

        <p>PCR targeting ITS region: The PCR was carried out according

annealing at 55&#xB0;C for 1 min and final extension at 72&#xB0;C for 1

yielded 520 to 611 bp product according to different fungal
species for ITS region.</p>
        <p>The PCR-based RFLP was carried out on ITS amplified

was added and incubated at 37&#xB0;C for 3 h. The restriction

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The application of nucleic acid-based amplification techniques
facilitated the detection of fungal etiology in tissue specimens
in our case. This technique has several advantages, it is
rapid (within 24 h), sensitive to pick up a lower threshold
of etiological agent and is specific, Moreover, this technique
can be applied to cases in which histopathological study is
given the first preference to determine the etiological agent.
To apply this technique the organism need not be viable, the
mere presence of fungal DNA would suffice to determine
the specific etiology. Alexandrakis <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> have used PCR
technology to detect the presence of <italic>Fusarium</italic> species from
a panophthalmitis case. There are several nucleic acid-
based amplification methods to determine the etiology from
paraffin sections. These include PCR, PCR-based RFLP, DNA
hybridization and DNA sequencing. Of these techniques, if
PCR and DNA hybridization have to be applied, then specific
primers or probes for each medically important fungus has
to be used. It might include several runs of PCR to detect
the etiological agent. On the other hand, amplification using
a broad range of primers targeting the ITS region followed
by subsequent RFLP analysis proves to be a cost-effective
method to detect the specific etiological agent. The results
are specific as the cleavage pattern is unique for each type of
fungus. Hence in this study PCR-based RFLP has proved to
be a rapid and reliable tool in detection and identification of
the etiological agents from paraffin sections.</p>
