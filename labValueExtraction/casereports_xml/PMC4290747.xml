  <body>
    <p>Patient MSV, a 61-year-old woman born in Penteado, Alagoas, Brazil and residing in S&#xE3;o
Paulo was hospitalized for decompensated heart failure (HF). </p>
    <p>Approximately 1 year before, she experienced dyspnea with moderate effort, and there was
marked worsening over the last 3 months associated with orthopnea and lower limb edema. </p>
    <p>Laboratory tests from when the patient was first seen at the InCor emergency unit (in March
2013) revealed: 3.3 million red blood cells/mm&#xB3;; hemoglobin 10.9 g/dL; hemocyte 33%; MCV
(mean corpuscular volume), 100 fL; leukocytes, 4,260/ mm&#xB3; (3,067 neutrophils, 213
eosinophils, 43 basophils, 809 lymphocytes and 128 monocytes); platelets, 146,000/mm&#xB3;;
CK-MB, 1.37 ng/mL; troponin I, 0.081 ng/mL; urea, 26 mg/ dL; creatinine, 0.92 mg/dL; sodium
140 mEq/L; potassium 4.9 mEq/L; magnesium, 1.5&#xA0;mEq/L; C-reactive protein, 6.31 mg/L; B-type
natriuretic peptide, 282 pg/mL; PT (INR), 1.2; APTT, 0.97 ratio. </p>
    <p>Radiography (in March 2013) showed an increase in the pulmonary vasculature and slightly
increased cardiac area with middle arc rectification. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). </p>

    </fig>
    <p>After administration of medicines, HF improved; however, after 1 week, the symptoms
worsened and the patient sought emergency medical attention and was hospitalized (on August
6, 2013). She also complained of burning precordial discomfort accompanying dyspnea on
exertion. She stated that there were no palpitations, syncope, arterial hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemias. The patient reported use of anti-inflammatory drugs
for treating carpal tunnel syndrome. </p>
    <p>The physical examination (on August 6, 2013) revealed increased jugular venous pressure,
heart rate of 100 bpm, and blood pressure of 117 &#xD7; 59 mmHg. Pulmonary auscultation revealed
decreased vesicular breath sounds at the lung bases and sizzling rales until the middle
third; cardiac auscultation revealed no changes. The abdomen had no visceromegaly or
ascites, and there was discrete edema in the lower limbs.</p>
    <p>Chest radiography (on August 6, 2013) revealed bilateral opacification of the costophrenic
sinuses, increased pulmonary vasculature, and increased heart size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>). </p>

    <p>The electrocardiogram (ECG, on August 7, 2013) showed sinus rhythm, a heart rate of 78 bpm,
low voltage QRS complexes, and diffuse ventricular repolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3</xref>). </p>

    <p>The following was revealed by the echocardiogram (on August 8, 2013): aortic sinus, 29 mm;
left atrium, 42 mm; septal thickness, 16 mm and posterior wall thickness, 12&#xA0;mm; left
ventricle (diastole/systole), 42/29 mm; ejection fraction, 57% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Figure 4</xref>). The left ventricle showed marked hypertrophy without
segmental changes. The filling pattern was restrictive and not reversible with the Valsalva
maneuver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Figure 5</xref>). The right ventricle had
preserved systolic function without valvular dysfunction. There were signs of pulmonary
hypertension, and pulmonary artery pressure was estimated to be at 50 mmHg. The E (mitral
protodiastolic speed)/E&#x2019; (protodiastolic velocity of the mitral annulus) ratio was 15
(normal value &lt; 8), indicative of the left atrial pressure above 20 mmHg. </p>

urea and creatinine levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f06">Figure 6</xref>). Dialysis was indicated, during which the
patient showed signs of bacteremia, and the procedure was stopped. This was followed by
worsening dyspnea and cardiac arrest by hypoxia. Resuscitation and orotracheal intubation
for respiratory support were started, but there was no response, and the patient died (at

      <title>Clinical aspects</title>
      <p>The patient was a 61-year-old woman who developed HF in March 2013, with initial
improvement after introduction of a specific treatment. However, 5 months later, she was
admitted to the emergency room with decompensated underlying disease, requiring
hospitalization. </p>
      <p>HF is a complex syndrome resulting from any structural or functional damage to
ventricular filling or ejection volume.<sup><xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The cardinal manifestations of HF are dyspnea and fatigue, which in
turn may cause exercise intolerance, fluid retention, and pulmonary and systemic
congestion<sup><xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. There is no
specific diagnostic test for HF because it is primarily a syndrome of clinical diagnosis
based on the history and physical exam<sup><xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The importance of an active search for risk factors or previous
cardiovascular disease should be emphasized in determining the etiology for this
syndrome. </p>
      <p>The patient returned to the emergency room with worsening dyspnea on exertion and
burning chest discomfort. The patient presented no risk factors relevant to HF, except
for the recent use of anti-inflammatory drugs, which could be a cause for decompensation
of the disease. Physical examination called attention to signs of pulmonary congestion,
as well as elevated right atrial pressure, increased jugular venous pressure, and signs
of systemic congestion, observed in the edema of the lower limbs. The reduction in lower
lung lobe auscultation corresponds to bilateral pleural effusion, which can be
associated with HF or possibly with the patient&#x2019;s underlying disease. </p>
      <p>Considering the history and the physical examination, we concluded that the patient had
a cardiac insufficiency syndrome with the involvement of left and right cardiac
chambers. </p>
      <p>After analyzing the complementary tests, a significant worsening of renal function was
noted in relation to the tests performed in March, as well as a significant drop in
hemoglobin values, indicating anemia and acute renal failure. The U/Cr ratio remained
&lt;&#xA0;40, and type I urine results revealed the presence of significant proteinuria,
suggesting a parenchymatous process for renal dysfunction. Another relevant fact is the
elevation of the myocardial necrosis markers, which may be associated with coronary
disease or, more likely, with the kidney disease and decompensated HF, because the
patient did not present significant risk factors for ischemic cardiovascular disease. </p>
      <p>The intake chest X-ray confirms the findings of the physical examination, demonstrating
bilateral pleural effusion and some degree of pulmonary congestion, with cardiac area at
the upper limit of normal. </p>
      <p>The ECG showed low QRS voltage, most evident in the frontal plane, late R wave
progression in the horizontal plane, and diffuse changes in ventricular repolarization.
This pattern can be found in some diseases such as decompensated hypothyroidism,
pericardial effusion, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in addition to
infiltrative cardiomyopathies. Although the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was
elevated (17.1), the value was not high enough to justify a myxedema coma, which would
lead to the ECG changes. </p>
      <p>At this time, echocardiography would be instrumental in identifying the etiological
cause of the decompensation. This examination ruled out the presence of pericardial
effusion, showing significant left ventricular hypertrophy with some degree of
asymmetry, in addition to indirect signs of restrictive cardiomyopathy<sup><xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Myocardial hypertrophy is often
associated with hypertension or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but both involve normal or
increased voltage on the ECG; and therefore, the findings of ventricular hypertrophy
associated with reduced voltage on the ECG in the absence of pericardial effusion are
unique to infiltrative cardiomyopathies, a group of cardiac diseases within the
restrictive cardiomyopathies<sup><xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. </p>
      <p>Among the functional categories of cardiomyopathy (dilated, hypertrophic, and
restrictive), restrictive is the least common<sup><xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. It is defined as a disease of the heart muscle that negatively
impacts ventricular filling, with normal or reduced diastolic volumes or diminished in
one or both ventricles. Ventricular function remains unchanged, at least early during
the condition, and ventricular wall thickness tends to be normal or increased according
to the underlying disease<sup><xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. </p>
      <p>The principal pathophysiological finding in restrictive cardiomyopathies (CMP) is
diastolic dysfunction. Restricted ventricular filling occurs due to increased filling
pressures and loss of ventricular compliance caused by excessive stiffening of the
ventricular walls. This change is the result of myocardial fibrosis, inflammation or
scarring<sup><xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. </p>
      <p>Clinical manifestations can be either right or left HF, because both ventricles may be
affected. In the right ventricular involvement, signs of right-side HF predominated with
elevated jugular venous pressure, peripheral edema, and ascites<sup><xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. When the left ventricle was affected,
effort dyspnea was present and chest X ray showed lung congestion. It should be noted
that the heart area was preserved in radiography, as there was no ventricular
dilatation<sup><xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Atrial dilatation is very common; the ventricular thickness may be normal or increased,
diastolic volume may be normal or reduced, and myocardial relaxation is
affected<sup><xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. A diagnosis of
restrictive CMP should be expected when there is clinical HF syndrome associated with
normal cardiac area and preserved systolic function<sup><xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Ventricular filling basically depends on the pressure gradient
between the atria and ventricle<sup><xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. At
the beginning of diastole, ventricular filling depends on the atrial pressure, which is
increased. In the late phase of diastole, atrial contraction and ventricular compliance
are the main determinants<sup><xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Differential diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathies is conducted with constrictive
pericarditis, which is considered a classic clinical challenge and one with significant
implications for therapeutic conduct.<sup><xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>
Both conditions lead to rapid and deep decline in ventricular pressure at the beginning
of diastole, with rapid increase in early diastole until it reaches a plateau, leading
to a hemodynamic pattern known as the square root sign observed in the atrial pressure
curves<sup><xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. In constrictive
pericarditis, there is equalization of the diastolic pressures, whereas in restrictive
cardiomyopathy, pressures may vary more than 5 mmHg. </p>
      <p>Restrictive cardiomyopathy can result from a wide variety of systemic diseases, some
rare in clinical practice and may initially present as HF. </p>
      <p>The most common specific cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy is amyloidosis; in almost
half of cases, restrictive cardiomyopathy may be idiopathic. Amyloidosis is a generally
progressive infiltrative systemic disease.<sup><xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In its cardiac form, amyloid protein is deposited in the myocardium
and can result in restrictive cardiomyopathy, systolic HF, orthostatic hypotension, or
conduction system disturbances<sup><xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. The
ECG is greatly valuable in confirming the diagnosis, diffusely showing low QRS voltage
complexes that, along with the thickened appearance of the ventricular walls in the
echocardiogram, strongly suggest an infiltrative disease<sup><xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. </p>
      <p>In cardiac amyloidosis, in addition to the echocardiographic findings of the restrictive
component, some cases may display a peculiar granular and shiny appearance, probably as
a result of the amyloid deposit. The diagnosis of amyloidosis must be confirmed by
endomyocardial biopsy. In cases of systemic amyloidosis, biopsy can be performed on
other tissues such as the rectum, gums, or kidney. </p>
      <p>With respect to the treatment, measures to control symptoms related to diastolic HF
should be implemented, such as volemic control. Diuretics and vasodilators should be
used with caution because these patients' cardiac output is largely dependent on the
increased venous pressures<sup><xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Digoxin
and calcium channel blockers should be avoided because they may bind to the amyloid
substance and cause toxicity<sup><xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. A
specific treatment must be determined on the basis of the etiology of amyloidosis. In
its primary form (AL), alkylating chemotherapy can be used with or without concomitant
use of autologous bone marrow transplant. The average survival of patients with cardiac
amyloidosis is estimated to be 5 months<sup><xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Heart transplant should be considered, but with a possibility of
relapse in a short time and with survival rates of 30% for 5 years<sup><xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. </p>
      <p>During the patent&#x2019;s hospitalization, the patient&#x2019;s hemodynamic parameters and dyspnea
worsened. Dobutamine and diuretics were started without clinical improvement, and due to
progressive worsening of renal function, it was necessary to start dialysis. The patient
presented progressive hypoxemia and exhibited cardiopulmonary arrest with pulseless
electrical activity. Despite CPR, the patient died. <bold>(Dr. Fabio Grunspun Pitta, Dr.

      <p>In the autopsy, the weight of the heart was slightly more than the normal weight (390 g;
normal = 350 g), with approximately normal-sized cavities, presenting an endocardial
surface with irregular, yellowish areas. The atria had increased volume with the
endocardial surface being irregularly yellow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f06">Figure
6</xref>). The lungs had increased weight and reddened areas. </p>
      <p>The microscopic study revealed the presence of amyloid material in the intramyocardial
coronary branches; the endocardium and myocardium; particularly, the subendocardial
region, the pulmonary artery; and in part of its intraparenchymal branches, the vessels
of the renal hilum, and the glomerular capillaries, on the wall of splenic vessels and
hepatic portal spaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f07">Figure 7</xref>). Amyloid
substance was also found in the skin, tongue, bladder, and most markedly, in the
myometrium and the muscular layer of the digestive tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f08">Figure 8</xref>). </p>

      <title>Commentary</title>
      <p>When the patient was alive, she was diagnosed with diastolic type HF. Among other
possibilities, amyloidosis was suspected, which the autopsy revealed to be the patient's
main disease. </p>
      <p>Amyloidosis is a rare disease characterized by deposits that correspond to less than 30
proteins, assuming anomalous conformation. Type AA amyloidosis usually does not
significantly compromise the heart, accompanying chronic inflammatory diseases that the
patient did not have. The coloring of the tissue deposit is sensitive to treatment with
potassium permanganate, unlike what occurred in this case. Therefore, deposits
associated with transthyretin or light chains of immunoglobulins (kappa or lambda),
which make up the most common &#x2013; or the least rare &#x2013; proteins deposited in amyloidosis,
should be considered. In this case, the protein involved and the type of amyloidosis was
not fully clarified. Immunohistochemical reactions for the immunoglobulins yielded
negative results. These facts oppose the possibility of this type of protein deposit,
but do not rule it out altogether. The bone marrow was hypercellular; it was neither
possible to eliminate nor characterize the plasmacytic dyscrasia with certainty, which
in any case had no direct connection with amyloidosis. As for transthyretin, we do not
have its specific antibody. There are two major subtypes of amyloidosis with this
deposit: senile cardiovascular and hereditary. The senile cardiovascular type is far
more common in men, rarely appears in patients under age 65, and generally does not
cause deposits outside the heart or vessels, as observed in some organs of our patient
such as the skin, bladder, uterus, and digestive tract. Still, this cannot be totally
ruled out as the patient's underlying disease. Finally, hereditary amyloidosis is rarer
than those other types, and has a certain familial nature. Although the patient's family
had no history of heart disease, it is not possible to completely rule out this
possibility; additionally, there are several other proteins that can cause amyloid
deposit. Currently, the most accurate methodology of characterizing the type of deposit
is the mass spectra analysis of material obtained in histological slides by laser
microdissection<sup><xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. </p>
