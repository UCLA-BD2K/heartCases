  <body><p>The relative contribution of reversible &#x3B2;-cell dysfunction and a true decrease in &#x3B2;-cell mass during the onset of and progression of type 2 diabetes have been hotly debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Modest decreases in numbers of &#x3B2;-cells per islet and increases in &#x3B2;-cell apoptosis have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), but whether these are sufficient to account for the reduction in insulin secretory capacity remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Underpinned by recent rodent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), a new hypothesis has been proposed whereby &#x3B2;-cell failure and increased &#x3B1;-cell function occur through dedifferentiation and reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). We report, for the first time, expression of mesenchymal and &#x3B1;-cell phenotypic markers in human &#x3B2;-cells within intact islets of three individuals with diabetes.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Ethical approval was acquired and informed consent was obtained from the patient or the family of the patient. In addition to patient samples, control pancreatic blocks and isolated islet sections were prepared from five deceased donors without diabetes (three women; age 24&#x2013;61 years; BMI 25&#x2013;34 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>Tissue blocks and isolated islets were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin in addition to Sirius Red collagen staining using standard procedures.</p><p>Indirect immunofluorescence staining was performed on 4-&#x3BC;m sections after deparaffinization, rehydration, and heat-mediated antigen retrieval using citrate buffer. After blocking with 10% FCS, sections were incubated with guinea pig anti-insulin (1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, U.K.), rabbit antivimentin (1:250; Abcam), or mouse antiglucagon (1:1,000; Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, U.K.) overnight. Sections were incubated with anti-guinea pig fluorescein isothiocyanate, anti-mouse AF543, or anti-rabbit AF488/AF543 secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, Paisley, U.K.). For negative control subjects, primary antibody was replaced with appropriate serum. All sections were counterstained with 4&#x2032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s3"><title>Case reports</title><p>Patient 1 was a 65-year-old woman whose pancreas was procured during deceased organ donation after brain death after intracranial hemorrhage.

Diabetes was diagnosed 17 months before surgery and treated with metformin. There were no other comorbidities and BMI was 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

As in patient 1, &#x223C;5% of insulin-positive cells in affected islets coexpressed insulin and vimentin.

Absence of any of these phenotypes in control islets isolated from nondiabetic donors was confirmed.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s7"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Consistent with a role for dedifferentiation in the pathogenesis of &#x3B2;-cell dysfunction in diabetes, we describe previously unreported coexpression of mesenchymal and &#x3B1;-cell phenotypic markers in insulin-positive cells in two patients with recently diagnosed noninsulin-requiring diabetes and in one patient with previously undiagnosed diabetes. Furthermore, coexpression of vimentin in islet glucagon-positive cells has been demonstrated.</p><p>It recently has been postulated from a series of &#x3B2;-cell fate-marking studies of transgenic mice that dedifferentiation is the primary mechanism underlying &#x3B2;-cell failure in nonautoimmune diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Specifically, the investigators proposed that metabolic stress leads to activation of mesenchymal markers in endocrine cells, a phenomenon well described in human &#x3B2;-cells after establishment in adherent proliferative culture but not previously described in vivo in preclinical studies or in situ in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>The lineage-tracing studies performed by Talchai et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) demonstrated that a number of dedifferentiated &#x3B2;-cells undergo conversion to other endocrine phenotypes, leading them to suggest that &#x3B2;-cell reprogramming to &#x3B1;-cells may explain the apparent reciprocal association of insulinopenia with hyperglucagonemia in early type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The presence of cells coexpressing glucagon and insulin in the patients reported here is in keeping with this hypothesis. We also detected cells expressing both glucagon and vimentin, a phenotype reported in the preclinical studies. Dedifferentiation of nonendocrine pancreas with coexpression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers has been recognized in human sections, with occasional cells coexpressing vimentin and glucagon within the ducts of patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Our data provide circumstantial evidence for the recently reported phenomenon of &#x3B2;-cell dedifferentiation and possible reprogramming to &#x3B1;-cells in humans. Whether this process is reversible in vivo, contributing to the rapid recovery of &#x3B2;-cell function after calorie restriction or bariatric surgery, requires further study. If so, then this may provide a new target for the development of disease-modifying drugs that restore &#x3B2;-cell mass and function in type 2 and secondary diabetes through redifferentiation.</p></sec>
