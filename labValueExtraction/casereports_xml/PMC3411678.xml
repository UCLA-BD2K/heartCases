      <abstract>
        <p>We describe a three-generation family with tall stature, scoliosis and macrodactyly of the great toes and a heterozygous p.Val883Met mutation in <italic>Npr2</italic>, the gene that encodes the CNP receptor NPR2 (natriuretic peptide receptor 2). When expressed in HEK293A cells, the mutant <italic>Npr2</italic> cDNA generated intracellular cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) in the absence of CNP ligand. In the presence of CNP, cGMP production was greater in cells that had been transfected with the mutant <italic>Npr2</italic> cDNA compared to wild-type cDNA. Transgenic mice in which the mutant <italic>Npr2</italic> was expressed in chondrocytes driven by the promoter and intronic enhancer of the <italic>Col11a2</italic> gene exhibited an enhanced production of cGMP in cartilage, leading to a similar phenotype to that observed in the patients. In addition, blood cGMP concentrations were elevated in the patients. These results indicate that p.Val883Met is a constitutive active gain-of-function mutation and elevated levels of cGMP in growth plates lead to the elongation of long bones. Our findings reveal a critical role for NPR2 in skeletal growth in both humans and mice, and may provide a potential target for prevention and treatment of diseases caused by impaired production of cGMP.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Several lines of evidence indicate that signaling triggered by CNP plays an important role in chondrocyte development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042180-Yasoda1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042180-Teixeira1">[2]</xref>. Upon CNP binding, its cognate receptor natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NPR2) functions as a guanylyl cyclase to increase cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels in chondrocytes, female reproductive organs, and endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042180-Schulz1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042180-Potter1">[4]</xref>. Transgenic mice that overproduce CNP exhibit excessive growth, while defects of the <italic>CNP</italic> or <italic>Npr2</italic> gene, leading to impairment of skeletal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042180-Chusho1">[5]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042180-Tamura1">[7]</xref>. The increase in cGMP level activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase II and seems to promote the accumulation of extracellular matrix in the growth plate of CNP-transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042180-Pejchalova1">[8]</xref>. In human, overproduction of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) due to a chromosomal translocation was reported to cause skeletal dysplasia associated with tall stature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042180-Bocciardi1">[9]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042180-Moncla1">[10]</xref>. In addition, acromesomelic dysplasia, type Maroteaux, characterized by dwarfism and short limbs, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>Npr2</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042180-Bartels1">[11]</xref>. On the other hand, NPR3, which is thought to act as a clearance receptor, knock-out mice resemble CNP transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042180-Matsukawa1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we describe the first family with tall stature and macrodactyly of both great toes caused by a gain-of-function type mutation in the <italic>Npr2</italic> gene. The mutant receptor, p.Val883Met, constitutively generates cGMP <italic>in vitro</italic>. Animal studies using the transgenic mice expressing the mutant NPR2 in chondrocytes demonstrated that skeletal overgrowth was associated with the overproduction of cGMP in cartilage. Our findings provide evidence that cGMP production downstream CNP/NPR2 system regulates the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes and determines skeletal growth.</p>

        <title>Case Description</title>
        <p>The proband was a 15-year-old boy born to non-consanguineous parents. He was born at 40 weeks gestation by spontaneous labor after an uneventful pregnancy. Birth parameters were as follows: weight, +0.78 SD; length, +3.1 SD; and head circumference; &#x2212;0.2 SD. Long and wide great toes were already present at birth. His height remained above +2 SD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042180-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). His psychomotor development was normal for his age. Fractures at the age of 11 and 12 years led to his referral to our unit. At that time, his height was 177.0 cm (+2.7 SD). His weight and arm span were in the normal range, +0.8 SD and 99.7% of height, respectively, and his stature was proportional. Blood pressure was normal. Physical examination showed tall stature, scoliosis, and long hands and feet with arachnodactyly of all the fingers and toes, the great toes being markedly long and wide. In addition, the fifth distal phalanx of the hands exhibited minor clinodactyly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042180-g001">Fig. 1B, C</xref>). He had no history of cardiac diseases, hypotension, ophthalmic disease, deafness, or digestive system disease.

She was given no medication, including antihypertensive drugs. Her menstrual cycles are regular. Radiological examination of II-5 showed severe scoliosis and lumbar vertebra fractures as well as markedly long and wide great toes, and minor clinodactyly in the fifth digit of the hands, like the proband (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042180-g001">Fig. 1I&#x2013;K</xref>). The BMD of the lumbar spine for L<sub>2&#x2013;4</sub> could not be evaluated due to compressed fractures of the lumbar vertebrae. Clinical manifestations of I-3 were as follows: age, 63 years; height, 166 cm (+3.0 SD for her age); blood pressure, 134/70 mmHg. She underwent right hip replacement arthroplasty at 50 years of age because of degenerative hip disease. She developed hypertension up to 210/110 mmHg at 59 years of age, when antihypertensive therapy was initiated. Her great toes were large in early life and shortened due to arthrogryposis with aging.</p>

        <p>Then, we further investigated the effects of p.Val883Met on skeletogenesis by generating transgenic mice expressing the mutant <italic>Npr2</italic> in chondrocytes. Transgenic founder No. 4 exhibited severe bone deformities including elongation of the spine with severe kyphosis, metatarsal bones, and distal phalanges, and died at seven weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042180-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Founder No. 28 also exhibited an elongated tail and toes with mild kyphosis, and could produce offspring mice. The amount of transgene mRNA in cartilage was quantified by real-time PCR and standardized based on the mRNA level of <italic>Sox9</italic>, a marker for chondrocytes. The higher expression of the transgene mRNA was detected in No. 4 than in No. 28 (data not shown).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we have described a three-generation family with tall stature and macrodactyly due to a newly identified gain-of-function mutation of the <italic>Npr2</italic> gene, p.Val883Met. Increased levels of cGMP both in blood samples of the patients and whole cell lysates expressing the mutant receptor clearly indicate its hypermorphism. Transgenic mice in which p.Val883Met mutant NPR2 was expressed in chondrocytes exhibited the elevated cGMP concentration and the excessive growth and deformities of vertebrae and long bones, which reproduced the symptoms observed in the patients. Taken together, our data are compatible with the interpretation that p.Val883Met mutant is constitutively active and causes skeletal overgrowth by increasing the level of cGMP in chondrocytes. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the high expression level of NPR2 also contributed to overgrowth in transgenic mice to some extent.</p>
      <p>Histological examination confirmed that the skeletal overgrowth was caused by the widening of the growth plates in the transgenic mice expressing the mutant <italic>Npr2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042180-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). As expected, the histological finding was similar to, but severer than, that reported in the mice with overexpression of CNP in chondrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042180-Yasoda2">[14]</xref>. The disorganized arrangement of chondrocytes in the transgenic mice indicates the critical role of the CNP/NPR2 pathway in chondrogenesis. Interestingly, the number of hypertrophic chondrocytes appeared to be increased in the transgenic mice, suggesting the involvement of CNP/NPR2 pathway in chondrocyte differentition.</p>
      <p>Although NPR2 is expressed in various tissues, the phenotype seems to be confined to cartilage and bone in humans, as suggested by the clinical manifestations of our patients. It is worth noting that the transmission of the mutant <italic>Npr2</italic> gene seems to have had no apparent effect on fertility in the family, although infertility was observed in <italic>Nppc</italic> or <italic>Npr2</italic> null or hypomorphic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042180-Tamura1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042180-Zhang1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The second messenger cGMP is generated by two distinct types of guanylyl cyclases; cytoplasmic (soluble) and membrane-bound <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042180-Tesmer1">[16]</xref>. The two types share a similar catalytic domain which is conserved from bacteria to humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042180-Lucas1">[17]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042180-Wedel1">[18]</xref>. Seven mammalian membrane-bound guanylyl cyclases have been identified, consisting of ligand-binding, kinase homology, dimerization, and guanylyl cylase domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042180-Potter1">[4]</xref>. ANP, BNP, CNP, and intestinal peptides such as guanylin and uroguanylin have been identified as ligands for the membrane-bound guanylyl cylases. Although a few constitutively activate guanylyl cyclases were synthesized by chemical methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042180-Potter2">[19]</xref>, p.Val883Met is the first gain-of-function mutation of NPR2 in living beings. Since cGMP is an important second messenger of several bioactive factors, cGMP-related drugs such as inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase have been developed. Erectile dysfunction, pulmonary dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, headache, dementia, and cancer are the targets of treatment with drugs that increase cGMP levels. However, drugs that directly activate guanylyl cylases have not been developed, with the exception of BAY 63-2521 (riociguat) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042180-Mittendorf1">[20]</xref>. The amino acid Val883 is located in the catalytic domain and preserved across species. The mechanism of activation in the mutant is beyond the scope of this paper, but the substitution may facilitate a conformational change in the catalytic domain, and in future, an analysis of the higher-order structure of the mutant protein may lead to the development of new drugs stimulating production of cGMP <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we have identified a gain-of-function mutation of <italic>Npr2</italic> in a family with tall stature and macrodactyly. Our findings reconfirm a critical role for NPR2 in skeletal growth in both humans and mice, and may provide a potential target for prevention and treatment of diseases caused by impaired production of cGMP.</p>
