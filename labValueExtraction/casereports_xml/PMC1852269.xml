                            <p><italic>Background</italic>: Pyogenic sacroiliitis occurs infrequently during the peripartum period.</p>
                            <p><italic>Case:</italic> A case at our institution and a review of the literature were analyzed. A total of 15 cases were discovered.
The onset of illness was during pregnancy (40% of cases), within 3 weeks postpartum (40%) or post-abortion
(20%), and the presentation was usually acute (&lt; 7 days in 67% of cases). Frequent manifestations included
localized pain in the hips or buttock, sacroiliac joint tenderness and fever. Computed tomography or magnetic
resonance imaging revealed joint involvement in all cases tested. Microbiology was confirmed by blood (40%) or
joint aspirate (75%), and most patients were treated with antibiotics. Surgical intervention took place in five cases.
Pretermlabor was reported in only one case. All patients respondedwell to therapy without locomotive disability,
and persistent pain was uncommon.</p>
<p><italic>Conclusion:</italic> Septic sacroiliitis should be considered in peripartum patients who present with fever and severe
localized pain. Medical management is usually curative, and without an adverse effect on pregnancy.</p>
