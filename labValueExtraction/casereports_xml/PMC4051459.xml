  <body>
    <p>A 51-year old female patient presented with precordial pain and dyspnea at moderate
exertion, being diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis, with indication for surgical
treatment.</p>
    <p>The patient had arterial hypertension, mixed dyslipidemia, was a smoker and had systemic
lupus erythematosus, which initiated at the age of 16, as well as nephritis. She
reported anemia and seizures, which were attributed to lupus. In the past months, she
had presented with pleuritic precordial pain, which became worse in the decubitus
position and improved at the sitting position, which was attributed to pericarditis.</p>
    <p>The physical examination (25/10/2011) revealed the patient had good general status, was
hydrated, eupneic, with 60 bpm heart rate, and 110 x 70 mmHg blood pressure. Pulmonary
auscultation was normal, and cardiac auscultation revealed rhythmic sounds, hypophonesis
of the aortic component of the second sound and systolic murmur ++++/6+. The abdominal
examination was normal, with no edema, and wrists were symmetric.</p>
    <p>ECG (31/10/2011) revealed sinus rhythm, 48 bpm heart rate, 200 ms PR interval, 113 ms QRS
duration, 464 ms QT, disorder in the intraventricular conduction of the stimulus, and
changes in ventricular repolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure

    <p>Laboratory examinations (24/10/2011) revealed; hemoglobin, 7 g/dL; hematocrit level, 21%;
MCV, 95 fL; leukocytes, 6,940/mm<sup>3</sup> (72% neutrophils, 1% eosinophils, 1%
basophils, 22% lymphocytes, and 4% monocytes); platelets, 303,000/mm<sup>3</sup>; urea,
62 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.21 mg/dL (glomerular filtration, 50 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>);
AST, 36 UI/L; ALT, 42 UI/L; calcium, 4.3 mEq/L; magnesium, 2.30 mEq/L; total protein,
7.4 g/dL; lactate dehydrogenase, 447 U/L; sodium, 138 mEq/L; and potassium, 4.7 mEq/L;

169 mg/dL; and triglycerides, 378 mg/dL.</p>
    <p>The echocardiogram (26/10/2011) showed left atrium of 40 mm, aorta of 32 mm, septum of 16
mm, posterior wall of 15 mm, left ventricle of 50/32 mm (diastole/systole), ejection
fraction of 65%, left ventricle with normal dimensions and severe hypertrophy; mitral
valve with discrete thickening, with a 3.7 cm<sup>2</sup> valve area; aortic valve with
severe calcification, 0.5 cm<sup>2</sup> valve area; maximal systolic gradient of 138
mmHg, mean gradient of 83 mmHg; the relationship between the velocity of the exit path
of the left ventricle and the aortic valve was of 0.14 (severe stenosis when &lt;0,25);
there was discrete pericardial stroke.</p>
    <p>The patient received transfusion of red cell concentrate.</p>
    <p>High digestive endoscopy (3/11/2011) revealed mild antral gastritis and erosive
duodenitis.</p>
    <p>Cardiac catheterization and cinecoronariography (7/11/2011) showed severe calcification
of the aortic and coronary valves; there was a 70% lesion in the medium third of the
right coronary and irregularities in the other coronaries.</p>
    <p>The consulted rheumatologist indicated pulse therapy with 1 mg/kg of methylprednisolone
for nine days due to probable lupus activity, and, afterwards, 40 mg of daily prednisone
were maintained.</p>
    <p>The patient was submitted to surgery for aortic valve replacement by bovine pericardial
bioprosthesis and myocardial revascularization with right aortocoronary saphenous graft
(23/11/2011). At the end of the surgery, she presented with bradycardia and severe
hypotension, and needed to use an epicardial pacemaker to revert the picture.</p>
    <p>Decreasing doses of vasoactive drugs were necessary to control hypotension, and
examinations on the third post-operative day (26/11/2011) showed hemoglobin levels at
7.2 g/dL; hematocrit, 23%; leukocytes, 13,900/mm<sup>2</sup>, with 92% of neutrophils,
122,000/mm<sup>3</sup> of platelets, urea of 71 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL,
sodium of 143 mEq/L, and potassium of 3 mEq/L.</p>
    <p>The patient was delusional and with pulmonary congestion. Antibiotic therapy was
initiated with tazobactam and piperacillin, and, two days later, vancomycin was added.
The symptoms of delirium and pulmonary congestion improved, and she was discharged from
cardiac recovery on the seventh post-operative day.</p>
    <p>Hemocultures and urocultures were negative (29/11/2011).</p>
    <p>ECG (30/11/2011) revealed sinus rhythm and inactive septal area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

ventricle of 25 mm, septum of 13 mm, left atrium of 41 mm, left ventricle of 53/41,
ejection fraction of 35%. There was severe hypertrophy in the left ventricle, apical
akinesis of the other walls and atypical movements of the interventricular septum. The
prosthesis was normofunctional, with maximal gradient of 19 mmHg and mean gradient of 12
mmHg, and the relationship of velocities of exit path LV/aortic prosthesis was of
0.43.</p>
    <p>Uroculture (7/12/2012) was negative.</p>
    <p>Laboratory examinations (9/12/2011) revealed: hemoglobin levels at 7.8 g/dL; hematrocrit,
25%; MCV, 100 fL; leukocytes, 9,040/mm<sup>3</sup> (bands, 1%; segmented, 76%;
lymphocytes, 21%; and monocytes, 2%); platelets, 330,000/mm<sup>3</sup>; urea, 60 mg/dL;
creatinine, 2.48 mg/dL (FG = 22 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>); sodium, 138 mEq/L;
potassium, 3.8 mEq/L; PCR, 91.5 mg/L; PT (INR), 1.0; and TTPA rel, 1.11.</p>
    <p>The patient was discharged with a prescription for hydralazine, carvedilol, furosemide,
prednisone, chloroquine, atorvastatin, ferrous sulfate, folic acid, ASA.</p>
    <p>The physical examination at hospital discharge showed serous secretion in the scar from
the saphenous vein stripping in the left lower limb.</p>
    <p>The patient was readmitted on 20/1/2012 (about one month after hospital discharge) due to
an infection in the surgery wound from the saphenous vein stripping. Hemocultures were
positive for multi sensitive <italic>Enterococcus sp</italic>, and the patient received
intravenous ampicillin for 14 days.</p>
    <p>The transesophageal echocardiogram (24/1/2012) revealed aorta of 35 mm, left atrium of
41mm, right ventricle of 28 mm, septum of 13 mm, posterior wall of 12 mm, left ventricle
of 53 mm, and ejection fraction of 35%. The left ventricle was hypertrophic, and
presented apical akinesis and diffuse hypokinesis; the aortic prosthesis was
normofunctional, with no changes, with maximal gradient of 22 mmHg and mean gradient of
12 mmHg. The other valves were normal.</p>
    <p>Thoracic tomography (20/1/2012) did not show signs of mediastinitis, osteomyelitis or
pneumonia.</p>
    <p>The left lower extremity Doppler was negative for deep vein thrombosis (27/1/2012).</p>
    <p>The patient was discharged from the hospital on 3/2/2012, and the lower limb infection
was considered as healed, and the wound would be healed by second intention.</p>
    <p>The prescribed medications were: 100 mg ASA, 50 mg carvedilol, 100 mg losartan, 25 mg
spironolactone, 20 mg atorvastatin, 20 mg omeprazole, 20 mg prednisone, 400 mg
hydroxychloroquine, 5 mg folic acid, 120 mg ferrous sulfate per day.</p>
    <p>In a doctor's appointment (28/3/2012), the patient complained of asthenia, and prednisone
increased to 60 mg; the administration of ivermectin was added.</p>
    <p>Thoracic radiography (in March, 2012) - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figures 3</xref>

    <p>The left lower extremity Doppler was negative for deep vein thrombosis (17/4/2012).</p>
    <p>Three months later, she came to the emergency room of the hospital in shock, with 40 bpm
heart rate and inaudible pressure, so the use of vasoactive amines and orotracheal
intubation were necessary for respiratory support.</p>
    <p>Laboratory examinations (on May, 8) revealed: erythrocytes, 1,900,000/mm<sup>3</sup>;
blood cell count, 5.8 g/dL; hematocrits, 19%; reticulocyte, 12.1%; MCV, 100 fL;
leukocytes, 12,500/mm<sup>3</sup> (bands, 15%; segmented, 79%; lymphocytes, 5%;

bilirubin, 0.35 mg/dL; right bilirubin, 0;10 mg/dL; urine I, normal. Arterial gasometry
showed: pH, 7;46; CO<sub>2</sub>p, 32 mmHg; O<sub>2</sub>p, 104 mmHg; O<sub>2</sub>
saturation, 97.5%; bicarbonate, 22.2 mEq/L; and base excess (-) 1.1 mEq/L.</p>
    <p>Echocardiogram (8/5/2012) showed aorta of 37 mm, left atrium of 43 mm, septum of 13 mm,
posterior wall of 11 mm, left ventricle of 51/39 mm, ejection fraction of 50%, and
moderate hypertrophy of the left ventricle and apical akinesis. The aortic graft
presented thickened leaflets, minimum central regurgitation, and maximal transvalvular
gradient was 58 mm Hg, mean gradient was 39 mm Hg; the other valves were normal.</p>
    <p>Some hours later, the patient presented cardiac arrest caused by ventricular
fibrillation. After recovery, there were three more cardiac arrests with pulseless
electrical activity, which were reversed. Afterwards, there was a new cardiac arrest
with irreversible pulseless electrical activity, and the patient passed away
(8/5/2012).</p>

      <title>Clinical aspects</title>
      <p>The clinical case reports a 51-year old patient with systemic lupus erythematosus,
arterial hypertension and mixed dyslipidemia, who went to the emergency room with
fever and in shock.</p>
      <p>The systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease, which
is characterized by the immune complex deposition in the involved organs, including
the heart. Its clinical picture is determined by periods of exacerbations and
remission, with variable clinical course and prognosis.</p>
      <p>It affects around 20-150 per 100,000 inhabitants, being mostly prevalent among women
(8:1) and black people; 65% of the patients present with symptoms between the ages
of 16 and 65 years old. In the reported clinical case, there is a patient who first
presented the clinical picture with lupus nephritis at the age of 16, which is in
accordance with findings in literature<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Even though kidneys are classically the organs that are mostly affected by SLE, the
heart and the heart/lung circulation can also be significantly affected<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. This disease can have an impact on
the heart by means of several manifestations, which include arrhythmia and
conduction disorders, pericardiopathies, myocardiopathies and coronariopathy.</p>
      <p>These manifestations can be simultaneous and should be rapidly recognized in order to
establish the proper immunosuppression combined with specific cardiology therapy.
The clinical recognition of cardiovascular aggression can be difficult due to the
common existence of multiple clinical problems in patients with lupus, such as
infections and renal insufficiency.</p>
      <p>The pathogenesis of the heart disease in systemic lupus erythematosus is not clear
yet. The model that is traditionally considered for the pathogenesis of lupus
carditis is very similar to that of other sites affected by lupus, so it is believed
that the immune complex deposition and the activation of the complement would lead
to acute, chronic or recurring inflammation in the vascular endothelium,
pericardium, myocardium, endocardium, conduction system and valve leaflets, which
can be supported by the common finding of immune complexes, complement and
antinuclear antibodies in the affected tissues<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Pericarditis is the most common cardiac manifestation, which is clinically present in
up to 25% of the patients. Series of autopsies and imaging methods demonstrated the
pericardial involvement in more than 60% of the patients<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. It can occur as an initial manifestation of SLE,
or at any point of the course of the disease, as was the case of the mentioned
patient, or it can be a complication from chronic kidney disease.</p>
      <p>Clinical picture is usually typical, and it can be manifested by fever, tachycardia,
substernal pain (which is aggravated by the act of breathing, coughing or bending
over), and by the presence of pericardial friction at auscultation; the
electrocardiographic evaluation, with peaked T waves and increasing ST segment,
usually does not differ from other causes of pericarditis<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Despite the young age presented by most patients with lupus, atherosclerosis remains
as the most common cause of ischemic heart disease. In these patients, it is
possible to observe the occurrence of accelerated atherosclerosis associated with
the presence of its habitual risk factors, which makes this disease an independent
risk factor for the cardiovascular disease, as well as rheumatoid
arthritis<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>It presents coronariopathy prevalence of up to 10%, and eight times more chances in
relation to the general population<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Some studies suggest that the acute myocardial infarction can
be the cause of death in up to 25% of the cases, especially among patients who have
had the disease for longer. The risk of this complication can be 52 times higher in
relation to the population that is free of disease, when the time of disease
evolution is longer than five years<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>In the reported case, the patient presented not only SLE, but also other risk factors
that contributed with the development of coronary artery disease: systemic arterial
hypertension, smoking and mixed dyslipidemia.</p>
      <p>Additional causes of acute coronary syndromes in the SLE include thrombosis - usually
correlated to the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies -, embolism resulting from
nonbacterial vegetative endocarditis (Liebman-Sacks), and coronary arteritis.</p>
      <p>The myocardial dysfunction of SLE is usually multifactorial, and it can result from
immunological lesion, ischemia, valve disease or coexisting problems, such as
systemic arterial hypertension. The clinically evident acute myocarditis is not
common, and it can present itself by the presence of thoracic pain and tachycardia,
being disproportional to the presence of fever. Clinical signs and symptoms of
cardiac insufficiency are uncommon, being present in only 5-10% of the
patients<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Arrhythmia and conduction disorders can occur in the course of the disease, usually
concomitantly to other cardiac manifestations, such as pericarditis, myocarditis and
coronary ischemia<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Sinus tachycardia is the most common manifestation, being present in approximately
50% of the cases<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. In this case,
the patient presented with sinus bradycardia, with prolonged QT interval of 464 ms.
The expected corrected QT interval for that patient would be of less than 415 ms.
According to Okin et al<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, the
presence of this finding can be a predictive of morbidity and mortality.</p>
      <p>Valve involvement is common, being demonstrated in transesophageal studies in more
than 50% of the patients with LSE<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Valve thickening is the most common echographic finding, followed
by vegetation and valve insufficiency. Even though the severity of valve compromise
is usually mild and asymptomatic, in this clinical case we observed severe valvular
stenosis.</p>
      <p>The patient was submitted to myocardial revascularization and valve replacement, in
November, 2011, and on the third post-operative day, she presented with a suggestive
picture of decompensated heart failure with clinical signs of low cardiac output
associated with pulmonary congestion. Clinical measures were taken to compensate the
picture, including the use of antibiotics, with clinical progress.</p>
      <p>The main differential diagnoses for the clinical picture of the patient were
infectious process, myocardial ischemia and lupus myocarditis.</p>
      <p>The hypothesis of infection should be considered because the patient was in the
post-operative period and had SLE, cardiopathy and nephropathy, and such conditions
made her more prone to infections. The absence of fever and negative cultures made
this diagnosis less likely.</p>
      <p>Another diagnostic hypothesis to be considered in this context is coronary ischemia,
since the patient had already had a previous coronary disease. Besides, the
electrocardiogram and the echocardiogram presented new segmental changes, septal
inactive area, and septal akinesis, respectively. In this case, thromboembolic
ischemic events and/or coronary arteritis cannot be ruled out.</p>
      <p>It is usually difficult to tell coronary arteritis from accelerated atherosclerosis.
In cinecoronariography, arteritis is suggested when we find coronary aneurysms,
focal lesions or ones that develop rapidly, which could have been the case of the
patient assessed in this clinical case<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Based on the presented case, the factor that apparently triggered the clinical
picture of the patient was lupus myocarditis, since the patient presented with new
ventricular systolic dysfunction. The improved ventricular function shown in the
echocardiogram conducted in May, 2012, seemed to corroborate this diagnosis, after
the immunosuppressive therapy began, in the appointment of March, 2012.</p>
      <p>The diagnosis of lupus myocarditis is usually difficult, since it normally progresses
to mild and little symptomatic myocardial dysfunction, and mainly due to the
concomitance of other factors that are potentially responsible for myocardial
damage, such as ischemia, anemia, and secondary water retention to renal disease or
to the use of corticosteroids.</p>
      <p>On 8/5/2012, the patient was in shock and presented with bradycardia. Clinical
measures to compensate the clinical picture were initiated, including the use of
vasoactive amines and respiratory support. However, the patient had clinical
worsening and cardiorespiratory arrest on this same day.</p>
      <p>The main differential diagnoses for the final clinical picture were cardiogenic
shock, hypovolemic shock and septic shock, to be discussed afterwards.</p>
      <p>The hypothesis of cardiogenic shock caused by myocardial ischemia should be
considered. This diagnosis is less likely because, in the echocardiogram conducted
in May, 2012, no segmental changes were observed. In fact, it was possible to
observe improvements in ventricular function, in relation to the echocardiogram
performed in January, 2012. This improved cardiac performance can be attributed to
the optimized treatment of lupus cardiomyopathy.</p>
      <p>This echocardiogram also detected moderate aortic stenosis. Some level of valve
dysfunction could also be present in the immediate post-operative period, as a
result of the sub-stenosing graft implanted in a patient with a small caliber aorta,
which, in this patient, was masked by the moderate ventricular dysfunction that
occurred in the post-operative period. Another factor that could justify aortic
stenosis would be a thrombotic process, especially if the patient had
antiphospholipid antibodies and not under full anticoagulation. Another hypothesis
is the one of hypovolemic shock due to hemorrhage. Even though the patient did not
present exteriorization of bleeding, we observed important decrease in hemoglobin
levels (from 7.8 to 5.8). The high levels of reticulocytes associated with low
levels of bilirubin makes the peripheral destruction of erythrocytes less likely as
a causative factor for this anemia.</p>
      <p>For the presented case, the factor that apparently was the main trigger of the final
clinical picture of this patient was infectious, which is corroborated by the
increasing count of young neutrophils and by the reported fever, which was mentioned
in the beginning of the clinical case.</p>
      <p>Among all possible focuses for this septic scenario, we cannot rule out the
hypothesis of acute infective endocarditis. Infective endocarditis is the infectious
process of the cardiac endothelium, which can affect any cardiac structure: septal
defects, tendinous cords, mural endocardium and intracavitary and arteriovenous
shunts. However, these are the most commonly involved cardiac valves, especially the
mitral (40%) and the aortic valve (34%)<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Currently, for the diagnosis, modified Duke criteria are used, which are based on
clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic findings<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. The transesophageal echocardiogram became the
method of choice to visualize vegetation, especially at the presence of degenerated
and calcified valves or mechanical prosthesis. Therefore, in the patient of this
clinical case, the absence of vegetation at the transthoracic echocardiogram does
not rule out that diagnosis.</p>
      <p>In spite of the advancements in clinical diagnosis, of the advent of new antibiotics
and the improvement of surgical techniques, bacterial endocarditis still presents
high morbimortality, and its prognosis depends on the etiological agent and on
cardiac status before the infectious picture<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> (Dr. Wilma Noia Ribeiro, Dr. Alice Tatsuko Yamada).</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Necropsy</title>
        <p>The patient had two diseases: atherosclerosis and lupus erythematosus.</p>
        <p>Atherosclerosis was mild in the aorta, moderate in the branches of the left
coronary, and reaching 70% levels of obstruction in the right coronary artery,
therefore being submitted to revascularization with saphenous vein interposition
graft. At necropsy, the graft was obstructed in the ostium and fibrosed, which
means the premature closure after surgery. In spite of that, there was no
significant myocardial ischemia injury, only areas of non-abundant myocardial
sclerosis, compatible with what usually occurs at the presence of myocardial
hypertrophy due to ay cause.</p>
        <p>The lupus diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory data. Under the
morphological focus, several aspects can be attributed to the disease, and there
is nothing characteristic enough to allow the diagnosis. Therefore, the
surgically replaced valve had nonspecific chronic valvulitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Figure 5</xref>), which could also have had another
cause, such as rheumatic disease, for example.</p>

      <title>Comment</title>
      <p>The cause of hemorrhage was not determined: nothing was found in the arterial
territory that is normally examined during necropsies; possibly, there could be a
downstream lesion, in the circulatory tree. By considering the existence of
endocarditis, the main possibility is the occurrence of secondary arteritis (mycotic
aneurysm). Another possibility is that the vascular lesion could be iatrogenic,
since a catheter passed through that region, but at hospital admission the patient
presented aggravation of previous anemia and certain level of abdominal
distension.</p>
      <p>Segmental and focal glomerulopathy are usually a result of immune complex deposition;
in this case, it can be a consequence both of lupus and endocarditis.</p>
      <p>Even with necropsy, it was not clear why the patient presented worsened cardiac
function after surgery.</p>
