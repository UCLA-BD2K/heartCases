  <body>
    <p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can affect every
tissue in the eye - from the eyelids to the optic nerve manifesting
most commonly as dry eye, retinal microvasculopathy and
cytomegalo virus (CMV) retinitis. Dry eye in HIV infection is
due to decreased tear production associated with diminished
lactoferrin and lysozyme and is of mild to moderate severity
and can be treated with artificial tears.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> A detailed search
on MEDLINE of previously recorded literature of ocular
manifestation of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
did not reveal keratomalacia as the initial presenting feature
of HIV/AIDS.</p>
    <sec sec-type="">
      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>A 50-year-old male reported to the ophthalmic outpatient
department (OPD) with complaints of inability to see with the
left eye for the past three months and with the right eye for the
past one month. Onset was associated with pricking sensation
in each eye. He gave history of difficulty in seeing after sunset
for the past few years.</p>
      <p>He gave history of chronic diarrhea, especially following
meals, associated with marked weight loss for the past four
years. He was not a known diabetic. He denied history of ocular
trauma, fever, cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, breathlessness
or any systemic medication.</p>
      <p>Patient belonged to poor socioeconomic strata and his diet
consisted of only rice with occasional curry. He denied history
of alcohol or tobacco abuse. On general examination he was
markedly emaciated, weighing only 44 kg [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The vital
parameters were stable. The skin was ichthyotic. The hair over
the body was sparse and coarse. There was marked pallor,
koilonychia and generalized lymphadenopathy. There was
no edema, oral thrush or oral hairy leukoplakia. Abdominal
examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly. The respiratory,
cardiovascular and central nervous systems were essentially
normal.</p>
      <p>Patient had severe photophobia. There was bilateral
madarosis with tylosis [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. He had minimal circumcorneal
congestion. There was dry keratinization of the palpebral
conjunctiva with a corrugated appearance akin to skin. There
were Bitot&#x2032;s spots at the temporal limbus with marked xerosis.
The visual acuity was reduced in each eye to perception of light
with accurate projection of rays.</p>
      <p>The cornea of the right eye was reduced to a thin
opaque membrane seen in parts only and was covered with
mucopurulent strands. There was a gutter involving the
whole of the limbus. The anterior chamber was flat with iris
visible in areas of absent cornea. The entire iridocorneal mass
was protuberant with a whitish/pinkish-appearing patch in
the center [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. The intraocular pressure could not be
assessed.</p>
      <p>The cornea of the left eye was shrunken to about 6 mm
in diameter, opaque, thinned out and flattened with nasal
vascularization. The anterior chamber was flat with iris seen
adherent to the cornea. Rest of the details of the anterior chamber
could not be made out [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>]. The eye was hypotonous.</p>
      <p>Patient was provisionally diagnosed as keratomalacia right
eye and atrophic bulbi with xerophthalmia left eye. He was
evaluated to determine any contributory causes for loss of
weight and chronic diarrhea.</p>
      <p>Investigations revealed hemoglobin 9.8 gm/dl. Blood sugar,
serum electrolytes, stool examination, renal and liver function
tests and chest X-ray were normal. HbsAg and C-reactive
protein were negative, electrocardiogram showed sinus
bradycardia and abdominal ultrasound showed splenomegaly.
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for HIV was
positive.</p>
      <p>He was given intramuscular injection of vitamin A 200,000
IU on the day of admission, the next day and then after one
week. In addition he was treated with topical antibiotics and
artificial tears. Within a week of the treatment there was a
reversal of all changes of conjunctival xerosis and keratinization
and the conjunctiva became pink and velvety [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>].
However, there was no change in the corneal condition. The
patient sought discharge against medical advice despite being
advised about his condition.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>AIDS caused by HIV is characterized by the deficiency of T
helper (CD4) lymphocytes, leading to an inability to combat
opportunistic infections.</p>
      <p>A provisional diagnosis of AIDS was made based on the
world health organization criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> which, was subsequently
confirmed in accordance with the National Aids Control
Organization guidelines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> Besides two major features, weight
loss and chronic diarrhea, and one minor feature in the form
of generalized lymphadenopathy, the patient was serologically
positive too, established by positive ELISA.</p>
      <p>He presented with xerophthalmia X3B. The diagnosis of
keratomalacia was based on the findings of a melted cornea
in a relatively quiet eye associated with clinical features of
xerophthalmia with reversal of the conjunctival signs on
parenteral vitamin A therapy. The patient could not afford
serum retinol levels and CD4 cell count or plasma viral load
estimation.</p>
      <p>Vitamin A deficiency is the direct cause of xerophthalmia.
Hypovitaminosis A is well documented in children, especially
following severe measles where vitamin A stores are rapidly
depleted due to increased metabolism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> Active corneal
xerophthalmia is extremely rare in older children and adults,
except in severe famines. They are a medical emergency
and require urgent treatment by high-dose vitamin A
supplementation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> Retinol deficiency is quite frequent in the
population of HIV-infected individuals. Serum retinol levels of
less than 1.05 micromol/L determine a 3.5 to five times higher
death risk.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> The recommended treatment for HIV-positive
individuals is similar to their HIV-negative peers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></p>
      <p>Liang <italic>et al</italic>., have found that hypovitaminosis A, E,
and B<sub>12</sub> accelerated the development of AIDS, whereas
their normalization retarded the development of immune
dysfunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></p>
      <p>In Ethiopia, vitamin A deficiency is recognized as a serious
public health problem among patients with chronic diarrhea,
with or without HIV infection. Vitamin A deficiency (VAD,
serum retinol &lt;0.70 micromol/L) was observed in 52.7% and
45.5% of diarrheic patients with and without HIV co-infection,
respectively. About 13% of healthy controls and 29.3% of
asymptomatic HIV-infected blood donors were deficient in
vitamin A.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></p>
      <p>Though hypovitaminosis A is well documented in patients
with HIV infection and is aggravated by the associated
diarrhea, keratomalacia as presenting ocular manifestation of
AIDS was not found on a MEDLINE search of literature. This
case is being reported on account of the unusual presenting
ocular manifestation of AIDS.</p>
