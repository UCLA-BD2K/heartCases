      <abstract>
        <p>Therapy for large symptomatic keloids is often plagued with complicated
reconstruction manner and recurrence. This article reports a rare treatment
combination for a chest keloid with internal mammary artery perforator flap
reconstruction and radiation therapy. We excised the keloid and covered the
defect with an internal mammary artery perforator flap. Immediate electron-beam
irradiation therapy was applied on the second postoperative day. There was no
sign of recurrence over the follow-up period of 18 months. The combination of
internal mammary artery perforator flap and immediate radiation therapy is
useful when faced with chest keloids of similar magnitude and
intractability.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Keloids are common, benign, hyperproliferative growths of dermal collagen of unknown
etiology. Due to pain, hyperesthesia, pruritus, and significant psychosocial impact
on quality of life, strategic approaches should be taken in keloid management. Many
treatment modalities, including surgery, intralesional corticosteroid injection,
pressure therapy, radiation, cryotherapy, silicone gel application, lasers,
photodynamic therapy, have yielded limited success for large keloids.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The lesions are frequently located
at areas of stretching tension such as the anterior chest, shoulder and upper back.
According to previous studies, the presence of tension seems to be one of the
determinant factors for keloid formation.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Here we relate a case of chest keloid, involving the
combined treatments of internal mammary artery perforator (IMAP) flap reconstruction
and radiation therapy. Recommendation of their use is underpinned by the core
concepts of tension-free reconstruction manner and rational multimodality therapies
focused on prevention of recurrence.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 45-year-old man was diagnosed with a recurrent major keloid over his chest, which
he had had for over 13 years. Past history consisted of repeated failed excisions
and intralesional steroid injections. The patient suffered from localized pain and
itching as well as progressive enlargement of the keloid. On physical examination, a
large 6(W) (&#xD7;) 8(L) (&#xD7;) 1.5cm (thick) epidermal mass was seen over the
midline of his chest below the cartilago ensiformis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). The patient was concerned about the risk of recurrence.
Therefore, a radical excision with flap coverage was planned, followed by
electron-beam irradiation therapy.</p>
      <p>

</p>
      <p>The patient underwent complete resection of the keloid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). An IMAP flap of 9&#xD7;7cm skin dimension was harvested on
the lateral side of his chest. The flap was based on the perforators in the fifth
intercostal space and rotated 180&#xB0;along the vascular axis to the chest wall defect.
After suturing the flap completely without tension, a percutaneous drain was placed.
The donor site was closed directly, which releasing tension by subcutaneous and
fascial sutures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>).Histological
analysis revealed a typical keloid feature.</p>

</p>
      <p>To achieve tight control in preventing recurrence, our patient initiated adjuvant
electron-beam irradiation therapy on the second postoperative day. He received 13 Gy
over four fractions in total. After being discharged, the patient continued to heal
well and the flap showed stable circulation without limited necrosis or other
conditions. At his last follow-up (18 months later), he was asymptomatic and
demonstrated no sign of keloids at the donor or recipient site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). The patient was highly satisfied with his result, and
was rated "good" by the surgeons.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>This patient is one of few reported cases of flaps for keloid reconstruction in the
English literature. Treatment of a large sternum keloid was reported, associated
with bilateral mammaplasty, from which the remaining skin was used for the sternum
defect.<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> There are two
recorded cases of microvascular free tissue transfer for keloid reconstruction using
transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap and free myocutaneous left lateral arm
flap.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>Furthermore, clinical
trials revealed that skin flaps, combined with postoperative radiotherapy, can be
more effective in keloid treatment.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
      <p>As a general rule, closing the wound should be performed with minimal tension,
therefore, Z-plasties, W-plasties and advancement local flaps may indeed be
indicated.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>In our case, the
IMAP flap was chosen for his chest keloid. IMAP flap is an island flap with
perforators from the internal mammary artery. Previous studies have shown that this
flap is a reliable and less invasive option for localized reconstruction of the
chest wall.<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Its advantages lie in
the flap's mobility range (90-180&#xB0; to reach the opposite chest wall), minimal
morbidity at the donor site, the cosmetic match to the reception site, as well as
its relatively thin tissue.</p>
      <p>Keloid resection and defect reconstruction were only the first step. The second
challenge was postoperative keloid prevention. Keloids in the sternum area are
frequently complicated by high recurrence. Surgical excision alone leads to
recurrence rates ranging from 80% to 100%.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The use of radiotherapy as an adjunct treatment has shown
success rates of between 52.4% and 91%.<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> It has been suggested that radiation may inhibit fibroblasts and
neovascular buds.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Assessed among
other existing adjunct modalities, flapscans provide bulk in addition to cover.
Hence, they provide better radiation resistance than skin grafts and other coverage
with poor vascularity. By applying the IMAP flap in our patient, postoperative
radiation may be considered the primary treatment option.</p>
      <p>For scar management recommendations in Asian, low-dose fractionated radiotherapy (12
Gy in three fractions) remains an effective adjuvant option.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Although scar sites with high
stretch tension could be treated with higher doses, up to 32 Gy in the literature,
we opted for a normal dose, as the IMAP flap had ensured maximum tension
relief.<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Moreover, for low
dose therapy, the risk of carcinogenesis attributed to radiation therapy is very low
when the surrounding tissues are adequately protected.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The limitation of our treatment combination lies in the surgical needs of a donor
site and the essential radiation protection. Diverse adjuvant methods have been
associated with recurrence rates of less than 10%.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Novel immune modulators, such as topical imiquimod
or intralesional interferon-alpha and 5-fluorouracil, used in adjunction with
surgery and the latest available technology in dermal replacement, could yield
better alternatives.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>For future
undertakings, it may be useful to enroll a series of patients,observe multiple
adjuvant therapies and ensure comprehensive documentation of results.</p>
