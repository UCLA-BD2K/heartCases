      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Fistula from esophagojejunostomy is still one of the most feared complications after
total gastrectomy. Despite the development of new surgical devices and techniques, it
remains a major concern with an incidence around 5%<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. The use of endoscopic stents has brought the possibility of another form
of fistula treatment<sup>3</sup>. However, this technique hasn&#xB4;t yet been fully
incorporated into clinical practice. This article describes a case of an
esophagojejunostomy fistula that was successfully treated with an endoscopic stent. A
literature review about this issue also follows.</p>
    </sec>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 61- year-old male patient was diagnosed with an infiltrative 6 cm tumor located in the
lesser curvature of the medium gastric body invading cardia. The biopsy revealed a
diffuse adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cells. Co-morbidities included morbid obesity
(BMI 40.8) and arterial hypertension. Staging CT-scan showed a thickening of the gastric
lesser curvature without any lymph node enlargement. The patient underwent total
gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection and Roux-en-Y reconstruction. Esophagojejunal
anastomosis was performed with a 25 mm circular stapler with intact resection rings. No
leakage occurred after methylene blue testing. The anastomosis was drained with
bilateral tubular silicon drains. On the 5<sup>th</sup> postoperative day, the patient
presented diffuse abdominal pain and drainage of enteric fluid in the tubular abdominal
drain. A CT-Scan with oral contrast demonstrated a leakage in the anastomotic area as
shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
      <p>Since it was an early fistula associated with peritonitis, an exploratory laparotomy was
performed and revealed a suture dehiscence of 40% of the posterior wall of the
esophagojejunal anastomosis. No specific local factors were noted that could explain the
early occurrence of the fistula. Latter, the patient confessed unauthorized drinking of
liquids since the first postoperative day. A suture of the dehiscence area was performed
along with a nutritional jejunostomy, nasoenteric tube for decompression, and drainage
of the cavity. Two days after the revisional surgery, leakage of enteric liquid in the
abdominal drain occurred again, but without clinical signs of peritonitis. After
discussion and evaluation of the patient clinical status, it was decided for a
non-surgical treatment of this recurrent fistula. Patient remained stable with
antibiotics, parenteral and enteral nutrition. </p>
      <p>
<fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><title>Abdominal CT-Scan with contrast leak</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="0102-6720-abcd-28-03-00216-gf1"/></fig>
</p>
      <p>An upper digestive endoscopy was performed seven days after this new leakage to evaluate
the anastomosis and for planning a possible endoscopic treatment. The endoscopy showed a
dehiscence of 50% of the posterior wall of the anastomosis and no signs of obstruction
in the jejunal loop beyond the anastomosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure
2</xref>).</p>
      <p>
<fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><title>Endoscopy showing fistula</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="0102-6720-abcd-28-03-00216-gf2"/></fig>
</p>
      <p>A fully covered metal stent was placed occluding the anastomotic leakage. To prevent
stent migration, an external anchoring was performed with a piece of dental floss passed
through the upper flange of the stent, as previous described by our group<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Since the stent is fully covered, a pediatric
forceps was used to puncture the sheath, allowing the passage of the dental floss
through the mesh. An esophagography with iodine dye taken the next day still revealed
that there was a small leakage. Another esophagography, five days after the placement of
the stent, didn&#xB4;t reveal any leakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>) and
oral liquid intake was restarted. </p>
      <p>
<fig id="f3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3</label><caption><title>Esophagography five days after stent placement showed complete occlusion of
the leakage</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="0102-6720-abcd-28-03-00216-gf3"/></fig>
</p>
      <p>The abdominal drainage diminished dramatically without any more episodes of enteric
liquid. The patient was discharged from the Hospital one week after the stent placement,
with a closed jejunostomy and a strictly soft oral diet. The stent was easily removed by
endoscopy five weeks later and no signs of fistula were seen at this time. </p>

    <sec sec-type="discussion">
      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Despite the decreasing incidence of gastric cancer in Brazil, statistics show that of
those that are diagnosed, there has been an increasing incidence of proximal lesions
resulting in a higher proportion of total gastrectomies compared to subtotal ones<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. The use of perioperatory chemotherapy as well as
salvage and palliative surgery has extended the indications of surgical resection. This
trend has pushed surgeons to challenge themselves by performing operations on more
critical patients with higher risks of complications including fistula. At our
Institute, after 169 consecutives esophagojejunostomies for total gastrectomies between
2009 and 2014 there were nine cases (5,3%) of fistula with three fatal outcomes.
Specifically, when degastrectomy was performed the incidence of fistula was higher
occurring in four out of 30 cases (13,3%). </p>
      <p>Conservative treatments with antibiotics and oral fasting have been used in patients who
have oriented and drained fistulas with no clinical symptoms. Cases of peritonitis
require a surgical approach with suture of the dehiscence, a new anastomosis or even an
esophagostomy. Another aspect is timing of fistula occurrence. Early fistula suggests a
technical failure when performing the anastomosis and should be corrected with a new
surgical approach. An early fistula has the tendency to develop peritonitis since an
inflammatory blocking isn&#xB4;t fully formed.</p>
      <p>Recently<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, temporary endoscopic stent placement
has emerged as a minimally invasive treatment option for benign esophageal ruptures and
leaks. A randomized prospective study comparing endotherapy with surgery hasn't been
found in today's literature but favorable outcomes with low morbidity and mortality were
reported from several series with stent placement<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> including a recently published large
review<sup>3</sup>. Before stent placement it is very important to guarantee an
adequate drainage of fluid collections. Once drainage is performed, stents can seal the
leaks and offer protection of the mucosal wall. </p>
      <p>The extension of dehiscence must be considered before the stent placement. Fistulas with
a dehiscence area inferior to 50 % of the anastomosis have good results with stent. On
the other hand, if the dehiscence area is superior to 50% the possibility of fistula
closure is lower and it may reflect a major surgical technical problem, such as ischemia
and tension. Postoperative time of fistula appearance is also an important factor. As
mentioned before, early fistula lacks adequate inflammatory blocking, bringing the risk
of a complete anastomosis rupture after the stent deployment. Placement of the stent
after the 7<sup>th</sup> postoperative day, when the inflammatory blocking around the
anastomosis is more consolidated is considered safer. An esophagography with iodine dye
should be done after stent placement and, if leakage occlusion is confirmed, oral intake
may be resumed while tissue healing takes place. </p>
      <p>There are three types of commonly used stents: partially covered self-expandable metal
stent (PSEMS), fully covered self-expandable metal stent (FSEMS) and self expanding
plastic stent (SEPS). Clinical success has been very similar among studies comparing the
different types of stents, without clear benefit of one type over another (PSEMS:
48%-81%, FSEMS: 48%-90% and SEPS 67%-100%)<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Van Boeckel et al<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> compared the outcomes of three different stents designs in the treatment of
benign esophageal rupture or anastomotic leakage. Fifty-two patients were treated either
with a FSEMS, PSEMS or SEPS. Endoscopic stent removal was successful in all but eight
patients treated with a PSEMS due to tissue ingrowth. Clinical success was achieved in
76% (PSEMS: 73%, FSEMS: 83%, SEPS: 83%) after a median stenting time of 39 days (range
7-120). Twenty-four patients had complications, including: tissue in- or overgrowth
(n=8), stent migration (n=10), ruptured stent cover (all PSEMS; n=6), food obstruction
(n=3), severe pain (n=2), esophageal rupture (n=2) and hemorrhage (n=2). One patient
died of a stent-related cause. </p>
      <p>When choosing the type of stent, the endoscopist must be aware of the pitfalls for each
stent. Partially covered metal stents (PCMS) cause tissue ingrowth as early as one week
after placement<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, impairing its removal with risks
of bleeding and perforation. In a recent study, all four patients who were treated with
a PCMS for benign esophageal rupture suffered perforation when stent removal was
attempted<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. On the other hand, fully covered
stents (either metallic or plastic) are more prone to migration (20-42%)<sup>1,</sup>
due to its reduced anchoring capacity<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. However,
migration can be minimized with some endoscopic techniques, such as clipping the
proximal edge of the stent<sup>9</sup> or external fixation. In this related case and in
a similar case after, we had the opportunity to place an endoscopic fully covered stent
with external dental floss fixation with adequate closure of the fistula and a
successful removal of the stent after five weeks.</p>
