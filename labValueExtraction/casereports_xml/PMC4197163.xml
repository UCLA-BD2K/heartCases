        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>A 4-year and 2-month-old male
capybara (<italic>Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris</italic>) was diagnosed with squamous cell
carcinoma on the buttocks after chronic recurrent dermatosis. The capybara was euthanized,
examined by computed tomography and necropsied; the tumor was examined histologically.
Computed tomography showed a dense soft tissue mass with indistinct borders at the
buttocks. Histological examination of the tumor revealed islands of invasive squamous
epithelial tumor cells with a severe desmoplastic reaction. Based on the pathological
findings, the mass was diagnosed as a squamous cell carcinoma. This is the first study to
report squamous cell carcinoma in a capybara.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The capybara (<italic>Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris</italic>), the world&#x2019;s largest rodent, is a
member of the order <italic>Rodentia</italic>, family <italic>Caviidae</italic>, and inhabits
the eastern Amazon basin in South America [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].
Although many capybaras are maintained in zoos, aquariums and breeding farms worldwide, few
studies have investigated capybaras diseases [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, only 1 study has reported a spontaneous
tumor in a capybara [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and previous literature had
not listed reports of tumors in this species [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Guinea pigs, another member of the family
<italic>Caviidae</italic>, are closely related to capybaras [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and are frequently used experimentally. Their diseases are the most examined in
the family <italic>Caviidae</italic>; however, spontaneous tumors are reportedly rare in
guinea pigs [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, spontaneous tumors in the family <italic>Caviidae</italic> have not
been studied in detail.</p>
    <p>Virtopsy (a virtual autopsy) [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] employs computed
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for forensic investigation; The technique
is also used for conventional autopsy or to guide conventional necropsy [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In general, necropsy requires opening the body for examination.
However, with CT or MRI virtopsy, there is no need to open the body. In addition, comparing
postmortem CT or MRI data with necropsy and histopathological findings may be useful to
investigate biological traits including anatomical structures [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This may be advantageous in autopsies requiring non-invasiveness, such as those
of humans and endangered wildlife. Several studies have examined virtopsy in human medicine
[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], but few studies have reported the use of virtopsy
in veterinary medicine; virtopsy used to identify a neoplasm in a zoo animal has not been
reported [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, the utility of virtopsy in
veterinary medicine must be evaluated.</p>
    <p>Squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumor commonly encountered in numerous
species, such as dogs, cats, horses and cattle [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In
general, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma locally infiltrates and infrequently metastasizes
to the lymph node [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the mouse, a member of the order
Rodentia, spontaneous cutaneous squamous cell tumors are rare [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Murine cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma can arise from a pre-existing
keratoacanthoma or ulcer [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Murine squamous cell carcinoma is histologically subdivided into
well-differentiated, poorly-differentiated and anaplastic types. Well-differentiated squamous
cell carcinoma is characterized by polymorphic squamous tumor cells with intercellular
bridges, distinct cell boundaries, inflammatory changes and desmoplastic reaction. In
poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, individual keratinized squamous tumor cells are
observed. Anaplastic squamous cell carcinoma is difficult to be distinguished from mesenchymal
tumor due to its spindle shape [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In humans, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is histologically
subdivided into numerous subtypes [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
    <p>This report describes a rare spontaneous squamous cell carcinoma in a captive capybara along
with the clinical course, CT findings and pathological findings.</p>
    <p>The 4-year and 2-month-old male capybara (<italic>Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris</italic>) was
born in an aquarium in Nagasaki and maintained in an aquarium in Gifu, Japan. Approximately 1
year before the gluteal mass was discovered, the capybara was diagnosed with dermatosis; the
entire body was covered by abnormal keratinization characterized by adherent, dry and rough
excess keratinous hyperplasia, as well as crusting and scaling. Alopecia secondary to the
keratinous hyperplasia was present on the entire body, especially the limbs. Bacterial
dermatitis was suspected; therefore, cefaclor [10.8 mg/kg, per os (PO), ter in die (t.i.d.)]
was administered empirically. After 2 weeks of treatment, the lesion resolved. However, 1
month after remission, a similar lesion recurred. Ofloxiacin (4.3 mg/kg, PO, t.i.d.) was then
administered to treat a resistant bacterial infection. The lesion resolved following
antibiotic therapy, but once again, the lesion recurred 1 month after remission. This cycle
repeated 4 times over 10 months of antibiotic therapy including sultamicillin [16.2 mg/kg, PO,
bis in die (b.i.d.)], cefpodoxime proxetil (4.3 mg/kg, PO, b.i.d.) and doxycycline
hydrochloride (4.3 mg/kg, PO, semel in die). With each recurrence, a different antibiotic was
prescribed.</p>
    <p>One and one half months after the last remission, a 3 cm wide mass was found in haired
regions of the left buttock near the anus. The mass initially appeared hemorrhagic and
encrusted. Surrounding areas including subepidermal tissue relatively maintain the same width.
Recurrence of the abnormal keratinization was a concern, and therefore, gentamicin sulfate was
applied topically onto the lesion twice daily. However, the mass continued to rise and
infiltrate the surrounding tissue over approximately 6 months, and it appeared alopecic and
ulcerated. The growth was mainly exophytic, gradually endophytic, cauliflower-shaped and
fibrous granulomatous.</p>
    <p>A surgical biopsy sample was obtained, fixed in 10% formalin and evaluated by the Laboratory
of Veterinary Pathology at Gifu University. The tissue was then embedded in paraffin, cut into
3 to 4 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>m sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E); it was
ultimately diagnosed as a squamous cell carcinoma. Since the tumor had conglutinated the
rectum, the prognosis was poor. In addition, the capybara exhibited constipation and was
consequently euthanized.</p>
    <p>A postmortem virtopsy comprising a whole-body cavity CT (Asteion Super 4, Toshiba, Tokyo,
Japan) was performed at a 2.0 mm slice thickness for the thorax and 1.0 mm for the rest of the
body. A complete necropsy was then performed, and the organs and tissues were preserved in 10%
neutral buffered formalin. The tissue samples were sectioned and stained with H&amp;E as
described above. An immunohistochemical evaluation was performed, beginning by immersing the
deparaffinized sections in a Target Retrieval Solution (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark, 1:10) and
heating them for 15 min at 121&#xB0;C in an autoclave. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by
incubation with 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in methanol for 20 min at room temperature. To
avoid the nonspecific antibody binding, each section was treated with Protein Block Serum-Free
(Dako) for 30 min at room temperature. The sections were incubated with the primary antibody
Cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (monoclonal mouse; Dako, 1:50) overnight at 4&#xB0;C and then counterstained
with hematoxylin.</p>
    <p>The CT showed an irregular mass with rough outside at the left side of the buttock near the
rectum with a soft tissue density (63.0 Hounsfield Unit). The mass border was difficult to
delineate and was highly invasive into the surrounding areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Coronal section CT of a gluteal mass (circle) in a capybara, which was highly invasive,
of soft tissue density, and had an indistinct border, the femur (arrows) and
calcification-like lesions (arrowheads).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1301-g001"/></fig>). Therefore, endophytic evaluation was difficult on CT. Calcified foci were observed
surrounding the mass, but metastasis and osteolysis were not detected.</p>
    <p>On necropsy, a large mass measuring approximately 20 &#xD7; 10 &#xD7; 9.5 cm in diameter was found at
the buttocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Macroscopic photographs of a capybara diagnosed with a squamous cell carcinoma on the
buttocks. A large mass is present on the buttocks and can be correlated to the mass
identified on CT.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1301-g002"/></fig>). The surface was ulcerated and hemorrhagic. Variously- sized multiple masses were
found between the ventral anus and the inguinal region. The lesions mainly exist in the left
side of the rectum and anus. The mass infiltrated near the rectum and into the surrounding
muscle. A desmoplastic reaction was observed macroscopically on the cut surface of the mass
and interrupted the surrounding muscle. The inguinal lymph nodes were markedly enlarged, and
discolored multifocal yellowish mottles were found on the cut surface. There was a large
amount of feces in the rectum.</p>
    <p>On histological examination, the cutaneous mass mostly comprised islands or cords of
infiltrating squamous epithelial tumor cell layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig.
3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Histopathological features of a squamous cell carcinoma in a capybara. HE. a) The
lesion comprised islands of invasive squamous epithelial tumor cells with a severe
desmoplastic reaction. Bar=500 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>m. b) The tumor cells showed various
degrees of keratinization with keratin pearls. Inflammatory cells frequently infiltrated
many of the keratin pearls. Bar=200 <italic>&#xB5;</italic>m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-76-1301-g003"/></fig>). The tumor cells possessed large nuclei with marked atypia, 1 or 2 prominent nucleoli,
a moderate-to-abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and distinct cell boundaries. There was an
average of 3 to 4 mitotic figures per 10 fields (400&#xD7;). The cells showed various degrees of
keratinization with keratin pearls in the cell islands. Inflammatory cells, such as
neutrophils and lymphocytes, frequently infiltrated the keratin pearls. The tumor cells were
highly invasive and were accompanied by a severe desmoplastic reaction of surrounding reactive
fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref>). The neoplastic tissue
infiltrated the muscle layer, which had a particularly severe desmoplastic reaction.
Metastasis was present and replaced nearly the entire inguinal lymph node. On
immunohistochemistry, the tumor cytoplasm was intensely positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3,
confirming the cell origin as being epithelial.</p>
    <p>Very few studies have investigated the diseases of capybara [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Scabies, ticks in the genus
<italic>Amlyomma</italic>, helminthes, coccidia, trypanosomiasis, brucellosis and sanitary
management in breeding farms are mainly reported [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>],
while studies of noninfectious diseases, particularly neoplasia, are scarce [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This is the
first known report of squamous cell carcinoma in a capybara. The only similar previous report
described a fibrosarcoma in an 8-year-old capybara [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], far older than the capybara presently reported. Capybaras live for 8 to 10 years
[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and in guinea pigs, which are closely related to
capybaras, tumors are more prevalent in older animals [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, an external factor other than age may have contributed to tumor
development in the juvenile of the present case. There are several factors known to spur
squamous cell carcinoma development. Ultraviolet light, keratoacanthoma, viruses, hyperplasia
and chronic inflammation can all progress or induce cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in mice
[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the
present case, the tumor arose mostly above the skin surface initially, and therefore, it may
not have arisen from a pre-existing keratoacanthoma [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].
Notably, the patient experienced intermittent chronic episodes of abnormal keratinization
remission and recurrence that predated the present tumor; this abnormal keratinization may
have been related to neoplastic development. Bacterial dermatitis was initially suspected as
the underlying etiology; therefore, antibiotics were administered, and the lesion temporarily
responded. However, the actual cause of the dermal lesions was not diagnosed; therefore, clear
causality cannot be established. Yet, the recurrent abnormal keratinization may have been an
inciting factor in the tumor, based on the similar pattern of keratinization in both the
dermal lesions and the mass itself.</p>
    <p>In the present case, the tumor was diagnosed as a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma
based on murine histological classification [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and had several remarkable characteristics. The
desmoplastic reaction was severe, and tumor cells surrounded by reactive fibroblasts had
infiltrated the muscle. The desmoplastic reaction of squamous cell carcinoma accompanies tumor
infiltration. Human desmoplastic squamous cell carcinoma, which is a stroma-rich squamous cell
carcinoma, metastasizes and locally infiltrates more often than does the common squamous cell
carcinoma [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Similarly, in the present case, metastasis was observed at the regional lymph
nodes. Based on these pathological features, the present case may represent a characteristic
histological squamous cell carcinoma subtype similar to human desmoplastic squamous cell
carcinoma. Unlike human lesions, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in animals is not
differentiated into complex subtypes [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Additional
investigation may reveal that highly-aggressive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in capybara
is accompanied by a more severe desmoplastic reaction.</p>
    <p>As reported previously [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], CT-based virtopsy was a
useful guide for necropsy in the present case. The postmortem CT provided valuable information
in the present case by revealing the absence of osteolysis. In addition, the histological and
CT findings were correlated to a degree. A severe desmoplastic reaction found histologically
may be correlated to the soft tissue density on CT [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, metastasis was not detected on CT; this may be due to the unavailability
of a contrast medium, which provides information about metastasis and tumor characteristics
[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A contrast medium could not be used, because
the CT was performed after euthanasia. More investigations about the filming condition are
needed to use CT scans as virtopsy.</p>
    <p>This report presents the clinical course and pathological findings of a cutaneous squamous
cell carcinoma in a capybara. Postmortem CT-based virtopsy revealed that the mass was invasive
and of soft tissue density with no metastasis detected. However, on histological analysis,
metastasis was found in the regional lymph nodes. These differences between virtopsy and
histological analysis may resolve by little contrivance. Histologically, the mass showed
features similar to a murine well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Additional reports
could further characterize tumors in capybara and the family <italic>Caviidae</italic>.</p>
