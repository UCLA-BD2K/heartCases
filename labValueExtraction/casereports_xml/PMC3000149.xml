    <p>The smallpox vaccine, formulated with vaccinia virus, is a highly effective immunizing
            agent. In 1980, the World Health Organization certified that the world was free of
            naturally occurring smallpox, and smallpox immunization programs were subsequently
            discontinued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>). Vaccination is still recommended for particular groups, namely, healthcare
            workers who handle materials potentially infected with vaccinia virus or other
            orthopoxviruses that infect humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>).</p>
    <p>The use of vaccinia virus in laboratories is likely to increase as a consequence of
            international concerns about the potential use of variola (smallpox) virus as a
            bioterrorism weapon. The vaccine is considered safe but can produce mild to moderate
            disease in vaccinees and can be disseminated to their close contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>). Accidental infections have also been reported. In 1991, an accidental
            infection with recombinant vaccinia virus was described after a needlestick injury on
            the left thumb of a laboratory worker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>). A case of vaccinia keratouveitis has been reported after accidental ocular
            autoinoculation from a recent vaccination site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>). We now report the accidental infection of a laboratory worker who manipulated
            vaccinia virus&#x2013;infected cells.</p>

      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>A 26-year-old healthy laboratory worker, previously vaccinated against smallpox in
                childhood, sought treatment in March 2002 with a history of pain followed by the
                appearance of erythema and a pustule on the left thumb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). These symptoms appeared 3 days after she experienced
                an accidental needlestick while working with material from a vaccinia virus (strain
                WR)&#x2013;infected cell culture during a virus purification procedure. Local
                symptoms worsened, and on the days 5 and 6, respectively, she noticed new pustules
                on the fourth and fifth fingers of the same hand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Axillary lymphadenopathy was noticed on the day 6 after the
                accident. On day 8, necrotic areas around the lesions and a large erythemathous
                lesion appeared on the left forearm. On day 9 after inoculation, the local lesions
                worsened and amoxicillin/clavunate (1,750/250 mg per day) was administered because
                of a clinical suspicion of secondary bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B, F</xref>). The hand lesions were surgically excised to
                remove the necrotic tissue, and pustular fluid was collected for analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, G</xref>). After the surgical procedure, the
                patient improved slowly until she made a full recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, H</xref>), and the lesions healed in approximately 3 weeks.</p>

      <p>Pustular fluid from the lesions was collected and tested for the presence of bacteria
                and virus. The Gram stain and cultures were negative for bacteria. When a diluted
                sample of the pustular fluid was added to BSC-40 (monkey kidney) cell culture, a
                poxviruslike cytopathic effect was evident after 48 h of infection (data not shown).
                Vaccinia virus proteins were detected in infected cells by 12% sodium
                dodecylsulfate&#x2013;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by
                Western Blot analysis with rabbit antiserum raised against total vaccinia virus
                proteins as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>). The protein profile was indistinguishable from that of the WR strain of
                vaccinia virus currently used in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The presence of vaccinia virus genome in the pustular fluid
                could be demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by restriction
                fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the phenol-chloroform&#x2013;extracted
                DNA from BSC-40 cells infected with the clinical sample for 24 h at 37&#xB0;C
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>). Total DNA isolated from cells infected with the vaccinia
                virus&#x2013;WR was used as reference. Two regions of the vaccinia virus genome
                were analyzed by using the following PCR primers: A24Rfwd
                5&#x2032;ATGAAAAAAAACACTGATTC and A24Rrev 5&#x2032;TTACACCAGAAAAGACGGCT;
                B9Rfwd 5&#x2032;GACTAAATATTCATAA and B14Rrev 5&#x2032;TACTAAAGTTCCGTCATC.
                The A24R gene was used as marker for the nonvariable region of the virus genome, and
                the PCR amplicons were digested with the endonucleases <italic>Ssp</italic>I and
                    <italic>Rsa</italic>I (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA), as recommended by
                the manufacturer. The variable region of vaccinia virus genome was investigated by
                amplifying the DNA segment from the B9R to B14R genes and digestion of the amplicons
                with <italic>Eco</italic>R V and <italic>Alu</italic>I (Life Technologies,
                Rockville, MD, USA), as recommended. The digestion products were analyzed by using
                1.2% agarose gels. The restriction patterns obtained for both regions in the test
                sample were identical to the profiles observed with the genome of vaccinia
                virus&#x2013;WR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

                9.6) was used as the antigen, and the serum samples were diluted 1/100. Bound
                antibodies were detected with peroxidase-labeled, anti-human IgG (Biolab
                Diagn&#xF3;stica, S&#xE3;o Paulo, Brazil) dulated 1/8,000 as described
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). The optical density (OD) values were obtained with a microtiter plate
                spectrophotometer at 450 nm (BioRad, Model 3550 UV, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
                CA, USA). The test serum specimen was compared to a panel of serum specimens from 22
                unvaccinated persons and 11 persons who had been vaccinated some time previously,
                including a sample from the laboratory worker taken 6 years before the accident.
                When we compared the serum specimens collected before and after the accident, we
                observed an increase by a factor of 3.5 in the IgG-antibody response to vaccinia
                virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, the vaccina
                virus&#x2013;specific IgG levels in the test serum were 1.6 to 2.8 times higher
                than the levels in the panel of positive control samples and &gt;5 times higher
                than levels in naive persons. Together, these results confirm that after the recent
                accident, a productive infection was found in the lesion and an immune response to
                vaccina virus was elicited.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Accidental infection with live pathogens by healthcare and laboratory workers has
                been frequently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>). The risk of infection cannot be avoided, although it can be prevented or
                minimized by safety measures. In some cases, vaccination of the workers is the best
                way to prevent the disease; however, vaccines are not always available.</p>
      <p>We report the response of a laboratory worker to an accidental needlestick
                inoculation with vaccinia virus in 2002. After the accident, typical symptoms of
                vaccinia infection developed in the worker, followed by full recovery 4 weeks later.
                Vaccinia virus could be reisolated from the pustular fluid, and no major variation
                from the original seed virus was detected. Although the patient had been vaccinated
                against smallpox &gt;20 years ago, a serum sample isolated 6 years before the
                accident showed a level of vaccina virus&#x2013;specific IgG antibodies
                approximately 2 times higher than the level in naive persons. This level of humoral
                immunity was not able to prevent the progression of the infection as would be
                expected if she had been vaccinated recently. This result indicates that despite the
                high IgG levels induced after vaccina virus inoculation, persons vaccinated for
                &gt;20 years are no longer fully protected against vaccina virus infection and
                could be vulnerable to variola virus or other orthopoxviruses that infect humans.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, we should consider some aspects of this accident that are not common in
                other situations (e.g., revaccination). The amount of virus in the needle before the
                accident was approximately 1,000 times higher than the amount in the vaccine
                preparations used for smallpox vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>). Even in a recently vaccinated person, a response to an infection of such
                high magnitude will most likely result in a local lesion. However, the question of
                whether a major reaction with severe symptoms would emerge in this hypothetical
                situation remains. Usually, a severe reaction has occurred only when a long period
                has elapsed after vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>). Therefore, after a properly conducted risk assessment, laboratory workers
                vaccination should be considered as an occupational protection measure against
                accidental exposure to orthopoxviruses. The results of this study support the
                current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices guidelines that recommend a
                1-year vaccination regimen for workers who handle low-virulence poxvirus and a
                3-year regimen for workers that handle high-virulence strains.</p>
