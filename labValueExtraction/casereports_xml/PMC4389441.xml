      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The supravalvular aortic stenosis (SAS) is the least common form of obstruction of the
left ventricular outflow tract, representing 0.05% of all congenital heart disease
<sup>[<xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. It is characterized as a congenital obstruction
of the ascending aorta, most commonly involving the sinotubular junction and may occur
as a dysmorphia like an "hourglass" or as a diffuse hyperplasia. This malformation can
occur as an aspect of Williams syndrome, being the most common cardiac defect of this
syndrome <sup>[<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> an
autosomal dominant inherited familial form not associated with Williams syndrome and may
also occur in patients with no family history and patients with homozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia, occurring in up to 44% of cases in this presentation
<sup>[<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p>
      <p>The main clinical characteristics of the SAS are syncope, dyspnea and palpitations and
the incidence of these symptoms is the earliest the progression of the disease. In
general, the disease is most commonly diagnosed in children, due to the presence of blow
associated to the obstruction <sup>[<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. The presence of adults with untreated SAS is even more
unusual. This is due to failure to detect the disease or diagnostic inaccuracy. We
believe that some associated diseases, such as aortic coarctation and malformations of
the great vessels may contribute to diagnostic errors or questions that often postpone
the appropriate definitive treatment.</p>
      <p>Late diagnosis of SAS may result in progressive symptoms, damage to the aortic and
mitral valve, and ventricular dysfunction, which draws attention to the need for
knowledge of the forms of the disease and its variations. We present a rare case of SAS
in adults, not related to Williams syndrome, already with aortic valve dysfunction and
anomalous origin of the great vessels, which may have favored the diagnostic
difficulties.</p>

Raimundo and approved under registration 04/2012.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>AST, male patient, 28 years old, with a history of heart murmur since birth, with no
symptoms.</p>
      <p>In 2006, performed an echocardiogram which showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy with
left ventricular mass (LVM) of 277g, reference value 94-276g, and mild mitral and aortic
regurgitation.</p>
      <p>In 2008, performed another echocardiography, which showed mild dilation of the left
ventricle (LV) with preserved function, mild mitral and moderate aortic regurgitation.
Aortic coarctation (ACo) with peak systolic gradient of 49 mmHg was suggested.</p>
      <p>Although asymptomatic, the patient did not seek medical treatment assistance, performing
new echocardiogram the following year, being evidenced increased LVM of 293g, normal
ventricular function, mild mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic coarctation and
suggestive sign of the left subclavian artery, with gradient 49 mmHg.</p>
      <p>In 2010, the patient came to our Service. A new echocardiogram was performed which
showed: mild aortic regurgitation, aortic coarctation with a peak systolic gradient of
45 mmHg, located below the left subclavian artery, and LV concentric hypertrophy of mild
degree.</p>
      <p>The patient was asymtomatic, referring fatigue on exertion and occasional syncope. On
physical examination, the patient was in good general condition, cardiac auscultation
with regular cardiac rhythm with two clicks, normal heart sounds, presence of more
audible systolic murmur in the aortic area, radiating to the neck. The presence of
pulses in the lower and upper differential pressure between upper limbs called our
attention, with higher right pressure. Then, we questioned the diagnosis of aortic
coarctation.</p>
      <p>Then, we performed angiography, which showed supravalvular aortic stenosis, severe
aortic valve insufficiency and hypoplasia of the left subclavian artery with origin of
the left carotid artery from the brachiocephalic trunk (BCT). For greater morphological
detail, was also performed chest angiography, which showed patent ascending aorta, and
showed significant supravalvular stenosis, 2.2 cm long, lying 2 cm from the emergence of
the BCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Surgical technique</title>
        <p>The patient underwent surgery for expansion of the ascending aorta and aortic valve
treatment. Surgery was performed with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), bicaval
cannulation and ascending aorta, systemic and topical moderate hypothermia, aortic
cross-clamping and administration of intermittent hypothermic blood cardioplegic
solution every 30 minutes. The aortotomy was performed in inverted "Y", extending to
the non-coronary sinus and the right coronary. The great thickening of the aortic
wall drew attention. The valve had become thickened and deformed, with the presence
of deposits of fat and calcium plaques.</p>
        <p>We opted for the aortic valve replacement with a mechanical double-leaflet prosthesis
type number 23 and enlargement of the ascending aorta with single bifurcated patch of
bovine pericardium, extending from the ascending aorta to the right coronary and
non-coronary sinus. It is important that the right coronary ostium is carefully
viewed. The pericardial patch should be large enough to allow certain bulging in the
region of the open sinuses of Valsalva, simulating the natural anatomical aspect. In
our experience, the cropped patch seems to always be a little bigger than
necessary.</p>
        <p>After suturing, the final appearance is quite anatomical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>). Biological glue was used to enhance hemostasis. After
rewarming, the patient was removed from CPB without difficulty and surgery was fully
performed traditionally. The surgery was uneventful in 3 hours and 30 minutes, with
80 minutes of CPB and 40 minutes of aortic clamping.</p>

        <title>Evolution</title>
        <p>The patient was extubated in the immediate postoperative period and remained three
days in the intensive care unit and total hospital stay of seven days. In return
fifteen days after the surgery, the patient was asymptomatic, in good recovery. With
two months of surgery, control echocardiogram was performed, which showed: LVM 260g,
cardiac chambers of normal dimensions, metallic prosthesis in the aortic position
with good handling of its leaflets, the Doppler peak systolic gradient of 37 mmHg and
mean of 21 mmHg with minimal central regurgitation.</p>
        <p>Angiography showed patent ascending aorta, preserved gauge, showing mild irregularity
of the contours in the cranial aspect of the distal segment, before the emergence of
BCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). With six months after surgery,
the patient remained asymptomatic and the echocardiogram showed LVM of 230g, normal
cardiac cavities, prosthesis with peak systolic gradient of 25 mmHg and a minimum
central "escape".</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The SAS is an uncommon congenital heart disease and should be diagnosed early for
surgical indication before its effects compromise other structures and, importantly,
aortic valve and LV. When more commonly diagnosed in childhood, it allows early
treatment planning and thus avoids major structural impairment of the heart. The
coronary arteries, due to high pulse pressure which they are subjected under this
condition can also undergo structural changes as described by Peterson et al.
<sup>[<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Thus, for all
these peculiarities, invasive therapy in the SAS should be earlier than in aortic
stenosis <sup>[<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p>
      <p>Since the initial reports of Usher et al. <sup>[<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> and Weyman et al. <sup>[<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>, echocardiography has been the initial diagnostic
examination in most cases . Some aspects related to abnormalities of the great vessels,
poorly assessed by examination, may impair the diagnosis and make other complementary
image tests necessary. The insidious symptoms, associated with diagnostic doubts along
the clinical investigation transmitted to the patient, favors his more relaxed behavior,
insecure and rejection of closer monitoring, delaying diagnosis, as reported to us in an
interview later.</p>
      <p>We believe that the hypoplastic subclavian artery caused false impression of aortic
coarctation, described in various examinations performed by different operators. The
same finest subclavian artery was also responsible for the differentiation of pulse and
pressure between the upper limbs (high blood pressure in right arm in relation to the
left), confusing the examiners. The diagnostic uncertainty should always raise the
employment of more complex tests. The idea of coarctation raised such questioning,
considering that the patient had lower limb pulses. Thus, we chose to perform
angiography also to assess coronary arteries and CT.</p>
      <p>We believed that progressive aortic insufficiency was related to obstruction immediately
after the valve, causing its abnormal turbulence. Echocardiography suggested thickened
valve with poor coaptation. The same impression we did not had of the mitral valve,
which appeared thin at echocardiography with mild prolapse of its brochure. The patient
also had begun to show symptoms, which led us to decide the immediate surgical
treatment.</p>
      <p>Surgical planning, considering that both carotid arteries leaves emerge from common
trunk, we concerned about the possible need to cannulate the BCT through a tubular
graft, what we have done regularly when we need to work freely in the ascending aorta
and aortic arch. We feared that some ostium was not well perfused. However, if
necessary, we may cannulate the femoral artery. During surgery, angiography confirmed
the impression that there was space for safe cannulation of the ascending aorta before
BCT, which was performed.</p>
      <p>For the correction of the stenotic aortic segment, techniques without the use of
prosthetic material are attractive, especially in children, as suggested by Souza et al.
<sup>[<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. In adult
patients, the reduced elasticity of the aorta and stenotic segments sometimes more
extensive has made us opt for enlargements using patches, which, in our experience, are
more simple and fast techniques, and effective, especially considering that there are no
adults in the concern with growth. In this particular case, after aortotomy, the valve
seemed inadequate to the plastic, making us choose to replacement using a mechanical
prosthesis, which was previously discussed with the patient.</p>
      <p>In continuation, the anatomical aspect of the aorta, with apparently normal left
coronary sinus, made us conclude that the expansion in inverted "Y" would be an
excellent option in this case. This technique was originally described by Doty et al.
<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> for moderate
or severe supravalvular aortic stenosis not involving significant narrowing of the left
coronary sinus of Valsalva, as in the reported case. In this case, we use large bovine
pericardium patch. It could also be used a polytetrafluoroethylene patch, with the
advantage of not presenting calcification, but have no such material available.</p>
      <p>We believe that one should not dry the curvature of the left coronary sinus in order to
leave the suture line straight at that point. Maintaining the natural design, or that
is, the vertices of the inverted "Y", while leaving a little longer suture line, helps
shape the enlargement patch after release of aortic clamping. The final touch with
biological glue has been a good additional factor in the hemostatic arsenal and we have
used regularly.</p>
      <p>The patient developed well after surgery. The earlier surgery might spare him the
replacement of the native valve, but fortunately he had no ventricular dysfunction. The
echocardiographic assessment also showed the satisfactory outcome of the surgery.</p>
