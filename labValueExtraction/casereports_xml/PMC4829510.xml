        <p>Lung lobe torsion is rare but life-threatening condition in the dog. Thoracic radiographs
and conventional ultrasonography cannot be conclusive for the diagnosis, and computed
tomography is useful but is limited by cost and availability. This report describes the
findings of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in 3 dogs with lung lobe torsion.
Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography showed the absence or reduction of pulmonary
vascularization secondary to twisting of the lung lobe around its bronchovascular pedicle
in all three dogs. Moreover, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography distinguished partial
pulmonary atelectasis from a lung lobe torsion. These preliminary results suggest that
contrast-enhanced ultrasonography can improve the accuracy of conventional ultrasonography
for detection of pulmonary blood flow compromise in dogs with lung lobe torsion.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Lung lobe torsion (LLT) is a pulmonary condition characterized by twisting of a lobe around
its bronchovascular pedicle [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This causes bronchial
obstruction and pulmonary blood flow compromise, resulting in congestion of the lung lobe
[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].
Progressive lobar congestion leads to parenchymal and alveolar edema, hemorrhage and necrosis
[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. While LLT is considered rare in dogs, it is
life-threatening and requires surgical lung lobectomy [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].
Therefore, this condition must be accurately distinguished from others with similar signs that
do not require surgery. Many diseases can mimic a LLT, including pneumonia, thromboembolism,
contusion, atelectasis, neoplasia and coagulopathy [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
    <p>Imaging is critical to make a diagnosis, because clinical signs, hematological results and
cytological findings from pleural effusion are nonspecific [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Radiographic and ultrasonographic findings of the LLT have been well described
in dogs, but these diagnostic tools can be nonspecific [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Twisting of a lobe around its bronchovascular pedicle causes pulmonary blood
flow compromise, but this change cannot be easily estimated. The study of lung vascularity in
LLT using color or power Doppler ultrasonographic modality could be hampered by respiratory
motion artifact [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Computed tomography (CT) is a
useful imaging tool in suspected LLT cases [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], but it is not widely available, can be cost
prohibitive and requires general anesthesia or deep sedation. Contrast-enhanced
ultrasonography (CEUS) is an imaging modality that improves the diagnostic accuracy of
conventional ultrasonography (CUS) by increasing the intensity of blood-pool echo signals in
arteries and veins through intravenous injection of stabilized gas-filled microbubbles as a
contrast agent [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In human medicine, CEUS is able to
characterize lung vascularity in peripheral lung consolidations [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In human and veterinary medicine, CEUS has been used to study the
vascularity within different organs [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], but to the
author&#x2019;s knowledge, the use of the CEUS has not been reported for the twisted lung lobe
examination.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this report was to describe CEUS findings in three dogs with confirmed LLT. We
hypothesized that qualitative analysis of the CEUS would detect changes in the vascularization
of LLT and provide additional information in the diagnosis of twisted lung lobe.</p>
    <p>Three dogs (3-year-old, female Bernese mountain dog; 12-year-old, female Pinscher toy; and
3-year-old male mixed breed dog) were referred to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of Perugia
University for suspected LLT. Clinical, hematological and radiographic findings of the three
dogs included in this report are summarized in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

All 3 dogs displayed similar clinical symptoms: dyspnea, anorexia/dysorexia and
pleural effusion were present from 1 week (Case 3), 10 days (Case 1) and 3 weeks (Case 2).
Chylothorax (Cases 1 and 3) and pure transudate (Case 2) were previously
diagnosed by the referring veterinarian. Hematological results showed leukocytosis (in all
cases) and hypoproteinemia (Case 2). Thoracic radiographs were suggestive with LLT in case 1
and not conclusive in case 2. Radiographic examination was not performed in case 3.</p>
    <p>For all dogs, both CUS and CEUS were performed with the same ultrasound machine (MyLab Class
C, Esaote, Genova, Italy) using 5&#x2013;8 MHz microconvex (for CUS) and 3&#x2013;8 MHz linear (for CEUS)
transducers. All dogs were placed in lateral or sternal recumbency with only manual restraint.
The sonography system was also equipped with a contrast-tuned imaging technology module
(CnTI<sup>TM</sup>, Esaote). All medical procedures were done with the informed consent of
the owners and in accordance with Italian laws on animal care.</p>
    <p>CUS examination showed moderate (Cases 1 and 2) to severe (Case 3) pleural effusion.
Suspected twisted lung lobe was hypoechoic, enlarged and hepatized in all dogs. A fluid
bronchogram and a presumptive dilated vascular structure appeared in the central portion of
the suspected lung lobe in case 1 and case 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Figs.

gas, was visualized craniomedially to the first lesion in case 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>). Color Doppler evaluation was non-diagnostic due to respiratory
motion artifact in all dogs. Suspected twisted lung lobe was located in the left cranial
thorax in case 1, and in the right middle thorax in case 2 and case 3.</p>
    <p>For CEUS, the suspected twisted lobe was centered on the screen, and a single focal zone was
placed at the deepest part of the lesion. The mechanical index was set at 0.04&#x2013;0.05, and the
gain was adjusted so that few signals from the surrounding tissues were present. A bolus
(0.03&#x2013;0.06 m<italic>l</italic>/kg) of sulfur hexafluoride microbubbles stabilized by a
phospholipid shell (SonoVue<sup>&#xAE;</sup>, Bracco, Italy) was intravenously infused by hand as
previously described [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Suspected twisted lung lobes
were assessed for the presence or absence of enhancement after the injection of the contrast
agent. The enhancement patterns were evaluated for 2 min and compared with the surrounding
tissues (other lung lobe, liver or intrathoracic vessels). In case 1, the suspected twisted
lung lobe displayed inhomogeneous and mild vascular enhancement after 12 sec from injection of
the contrast agent; enhancement was more evident after 28 sec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>). The second partially consolidated lung lobe showed homogeneous
and marked vascular enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>). In case 2,
the suspected twisted lung lobe showed absence of vascular enhancement after injection of the
contrast agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref>). Marked vascular enhancement
was visualized in a large vessel (caudal vena cava) at the periphery of the lung lobe after 8
sec from injection of the contrast agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref>).
In case 3, the suspected twisted lung lobe showed some enhanced vessels inside after 25 sec
from injection of the contrast agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref>).
Marked vascular enhancement was visualized within the liver after 8 sec from injection of the
contrast agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
    <p>Thoracic CT (Siemens, Milano, Italy) was performed prior to surgery to further characterize
the lesions in case 2 and case 3. CT confirmed the LLT showing an extended cystic-like lesion
characterized by ring-enhancement that involved the right middle lung lobe after contrast
medium administration (Case 2) and a consolidated area in the ventral portion of the right
medial lung lobe with mild contrast-enhancement of the lesion after iodine intravenous
injection (Case 3).</p>
    <p><italic>The final diagnosis of LLT was made by surgical exploration in all dogs</italic>: in
case 1, the left cranial lung lobe was rotated approximately 180&#xB0; and appeared to be
congested, consolidated and necrotic. Partial atelectasis of adjacent caudal lobe disappeared
after the re-inflation using positive-pressure ventilation. Left cranial lung lobectomy and
thoracic duct ligation were performed; In case 2, the right middle lung lobe was rotated
approximately 360&#xB0; and appeared to be congested, consolidated and necrotic. Right middle lung
lobectomy was performed; In case 3, the right middle lung lobe was rotated approximately 360&#xB0;
and appeared to be congested, consolidated and necrotic. Right middle lung lobectomy and
thoracic duct ligation were performed. Histological evaluation of the resected lung lobes was
consistent with lung lobe torsion.</p>
    <p>To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the use of CEUS in a small group of
dogs with LLT. Thoracic radiographs are the imaging technique commonly used to make a
suspected diagnosis of LLT [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In our dogs, radiographic
features were suggestive of LLT in dog 1 and not conclusive in dog 2. Because radiographic
findings are not specific, ultrasonography can be a useful imaging modality in the diagnosis
of LLT [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In
our dogs, a hypoechoic, enlarged and hepatized lung lobe, pleural effusion and portions filled
with scattered reverberating foci consistent with gas were observed by CUS. Additionally,
presumptive dilated vascular structures appeared in the central portion of the lung lobe in 2
of 3 dogs. A color Doppler study was not useful due to respiratory motion artifact. Color
Doppler ultrasonography could be limited to demonstrate flow in LLT, because of flow velocity,
vessel size, the depth of lesion, scanner sensitivity and operator control. Moreover, any
motion of the tissue produces a Doppler shift. To detect the changes of blood flow in LLT
(helpful finding in diagnostic process) and to overcome the limits of the Doppler modality,
the authors used CEUS. Lack of contrast enhancement after contrast medium administration
during a CT study can be seen when a lung lobe is completely rotated [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In case 2, CEUS showed the
absence of vascular enhancement within the twisted lung lobe (360&#xB0; torsion). Incomplete LLT or
twisted lung lobe at early stage can still show an arterial blood supply during a
contrast-enhanced CT study [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In case 1, CEUS showed
an inhomogeneous and mild enhancement of the partially twisted lung lobe (180&#xB0; torsion) in
agreement with previously reported contrast-enhanced CT findings [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In case 3, enhanced vessels were visualized during a CEUS study,
although the twisted lung lobe was rotated approximately 360&#xB0;. This finding was in agreement
with persistent arterial blood supply within the twisted lung lobe, but clinical signs were
present for 1 week and the twisted lung lobe appeared to be already necrotic during surgical
exploration. Clinical and surgical features were not in accordance with a short-time duration
of the torsion. In a previous study [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], twisted lung
lobes with evidence of necrosis showed contrast enhancement after iodine intravenous injection
during a CT study. The authors suggested that an arterial blood supply could be present also
in the early stages of necrosis [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Further studies
are needed to investigate the enhancement patterns in relation to the rotation degree of the
twisted lung lobe and/or the time of torsion occurrence.</p>
    <p>Lack of contrast enhancement can also be observed in other lung lesions, such as
thromboembolic, cystic or necrotic conditions [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The lesions present in these cases are usually focal
and limited to certain portions of the lung lobe. In cases of LLT, however, the entire lobe is
affected [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
    <p>In case 1, the CEUS revealed a homogeneous and marked enhancement of a second partially
consolidated lung lobe: during surgery, the left caudal lobe showed an area of atelectasis
which disappeared after the re-inflation using positive-pressure ventilation. These findings
confirmed the usefulness of the CEUS in distinguishing pulmonary atelectasis from LLT.</p>
    <p>CT is a useful diagnostic tool in cases of suspected LLT where the radiographic or
ultrasonographic findings are non specific [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], but it is not widely available, can be cost
prohibitive, and requires general anesthesia and ionizing radiation. On CT, case 2 showed the
absence of enhancement within the suspected twisted lung lobe after the contrast agent
injection. Absence of vascular enhancement within the twisted lung lobe was also observed by
CEUS. In case 2, contrast-enhanced CT also showed a peripheral ring-enhancement probably due
to the inflammatory hypervascularization of the visceral pleura. This finding was not clearly
observed by CEUS. Probably, the assessment of the blood perfusion in the visceral pleura was
difficult, because of the hyperintensity of this tissue during a CEUS study. In case 3, the
suspected twisted lung lobe showed mild contrast-enhancement on a CT study in accordance with
CEUS findings.</p>
    <p>Considering our preliminary findings, CEUS can provide additional information to the CUS, in
particular when a Doppler study is hampered by respiratory motion artifact. CEUS features of
the present report, in accordance with previous CT and CUS studies [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], suggest that the absence or
reduction of the blood flow can be considered a specific finding in a suspected twisted lung
lobe. Assessment of this change in pulmonary blood flow by CEUS, in association with
radiographic and CUS findings, can increase the index of suspicion in LLT, reserving use of
advanced diagnostic tools, as CT, only for &#x201C;atypical&#x201D; and limited cases. Further studies
discerning the value of the CEUS in other lung diseases are necessary in order to compare them
to the findings in this report.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, the results of this case report indicate that qualitative analysis of the CEUS
can improve the accuracy of CUS for detection of pulmonary blood flow compromise and should be
considered in the diagnostic algorithm in dogs with LLT. Moreover, our report opens up new
perspectives for assessing of pulmonary lesions using CEUS.</p>
