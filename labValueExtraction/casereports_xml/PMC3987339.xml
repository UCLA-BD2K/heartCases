      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The development of acute myocarditis in the postoperative period of cardiac surgery is a
challenge for the doctor who treats this type of patient. In most cases, myocarditis can
be only a consequence of procedural-related inflammation. However, differential
diagnoses must be observed. Among them, rheumatic fever must be considered as an
important mechanism. Although its cardiac manifestation is predominantly related to the
involvement of the valvular apparatus, its diagnosis is essentially clinical and it can
acutely impair the myocardium. In this context, the occurrence of acute rheumatic
myocarditis is rare and its immunosuppressive treatment remains uncertain. </p>

      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>The patient was a 23-year-old Caucasian female, born and raised in S&#xE3;o Paulo, who came
to the emergency department complaining of dyspnea at rest (functional class IV of the
New York Heart Association), palpitations, nausea, unmeasured fever and increased
abdominal volume for six days. She reported a personal history of rheumatic fever, with
two mitral and tricuspid valve plastic surgeries, in 1996 and 2011, and subsequent
mitral valve replacement with a biological prosthesis four months before, in 2012. She
also had chronic atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation. She denied other symptoms and
comorbidities. She was an irregular user of warfarin, furosemide 40 mg / day,
spironolactone 50 mg/day, captopril 37.5 mg/day, diltiazem 180 mg/day and sulfadiazine 1
g/day (due to allergy to penicillin).</p>
      <p>In February 2012, the patient started to have dyspnea at rest due to symptomatic mitral
valve regurgitation and remained hospitalized until heart surgery for mitral valve
replacement with a biological prosthesis. At this time she was submitted to preoperative
myocardial scintigraphy with gallium-67, which was negative for myocardial inflammatory
process. The surgery had no complications and the postoperative transthoracic
echocardiography showed left atrium (LA) with 50 mm in diameter, left ventricle (LV) of
56 x 39 mm, ejection fraction (EF) of 57% and unchanged mitral bioprosthesis structure.
She was discharged receiving the medications listed above.</p>
      <p>On physical examination, the patient was in good general health status, afebrile,
tachycardic (heart rate = 180 beats per minute), blood pressure of 90 x 60 mmHg,
tachydyspneic (respiratory rate = 25 breaths per minute), arterial oxygen saturation in
ambient air was 93% and she had intercostal retraction. Apex beat was visible and
palpable in the fifth intercostal space on the left midclavicular line; presence of
arrhythmic heart sounds with a loud B2 sound, holosystolic mitral regurgitation murmur
of 2 +/6+ intensity, breath sounds present with fine rales in the lung bases
bilaterally, hardened liver that was palpable about 7 cm from the right costal margin
and bilateral and symmetric 2+/ 4+ lower limb edema.</p>
      <p>At this time, a diagnosis of heart failure due to probable infective endocarditis or
active rheumatic fever was attained, considering the presence of fever and clinical
signs of pulmonary and systemic congestion, after which three pairs of blood cultures
were collected, an echocardiogram was requested and empirical antibiotic therapy with
intravenous ceftriaxone and oxacillin was initiated.</p>
      <p>The electrocardiogram initially showed atrial fibrillation with high ventricular
response. Chest X-ray showed interstitial infiltrates in the lower two-thirds of both
hemithoraxes, as well as cardiomegaly.</p>
      <p>Transesophageal echocardiography showed LA = 56 mm, LV = 71 x 62 mm, EF 20% with diffuse
hypokinesis of LV and bioprosthetic mitral valve with no signs dysfunction or evidence
of vegetation. Blood cultures were negative. At this time, we chose to maintain adequate
control of heart rate and administration of intravenous furosemide. To confirm the
rheumatic myocarditis, myocardial scintigraphy with gallium-67 was requested, which
showed positive for ongoing inflammatory process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure
1</xref>). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed, which showed significant
diffuse biventricular dysfunction and presence of myocardial inflammatory process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>). Laboratory assessment showed C-reactive
protein of 89.3 mg/L, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 2,553 pg/mL, ASLO = 693 IU/mL,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 50 mm and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein = 136 mg/dL.</p>

      <p>Due to the diagnosis of myocarditis, Prednisone 2 mg/kg/day was started. Two hypotheses
were then considered: postoperative myocarditis (procedure-related) and acute attack of
rheumatic fever. The patient showed significant symptom improvement and was discharged
on the 14<sup>th</sup> day after admission using prednisone 1 mg/kg/day, captopril,
furosemide, spironolactone, carvedilol, digoxin and warfarin. In addition, she was
referred to immunology for desensitization to penicillin and started to receive a dose
of benzathine penicillin of 1.200.000 IU every 15 days without complications.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="discussion">
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The occurrence of postoperative myocarditis is underdiagnosed. Most of the time, it is
not associated with ventricular dysfunction. It usually occurs on the days following the
procedure and, in rare cases, remains for a long time. The diagnosis of acute rheumatic
fever attack was established by the Jones criteria of the American Heart Association.
The presence of myocarditis associated with elevation in inflammatory markers, fever,
previous valvular sequelae and high ASLO levels are enough for the diagnosis of acute
rheumatic fever attack, which makes this the main hypothesis in the case<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>In literature, and in classic rheumatic fever, the three leaflets (pericardium,
myocardium and endocardium) are simultaneously affected, although in unequal
proportions, with usually subclinical myocardial lesion only. In most cases in which
there is a picture of heart failure during an acute attack of rheumatic fever, it is due
to a mechanical cause, due to valvular dysfunction, and clinically manifest myocarditis
is uncommon<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. In this case, the
patient met the criteria for acute rheumatic fever; however, the echocardiogram showed
no biological valve prosthesis dysfunction and showed significant biventricular
myocardial dysfunction. Myocardial scintigraphy and cardiac MRI confirmed the diagnosis,
by demonstrating the presence of myocardial inflammation.</p>
      <p>In the diagnosis of myocarditis, clinical, electrocardiographic, laboratory and
radiographic findings have low sensitivity and specificity. Troponin I is increased in
only 34% of cases of myocarditis. Sinus tachycardia, changes in the ST segment or T
wave, as well as bundle branch blocks, can be found, but they are not specific and
infrequent<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. </p>
      <p>The gold standard for the diagnosis of myocarditis would be the endomyocardial biopsy of
the right ventricle, but its sensitivity is questionable due to its focal nature, in
addition to being an invasive test. Scintigraphy and MRI have emerged as important tools
in the diagnosis of myocarditis. Recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of
scintigraphy, not only in the diagnosis but also the prognosis of myocarditis, with a
sensitivity of 91-100% and negative predictive value ranging from 93-100%<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. </p>
      <p>Sun et al<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> found a good association
between the degree of perfusion reduction at the scintigraphy and elevated markers of
myocardial necrosis and ST-T changes related to myocarditis. Regarding the role of
magnetic resonance imaging, Abdel Aty et al stuyding 25 patients with suspected
myocarditis and 23 controls, found a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 74%<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. However, specifically in rheumatic
myocarditis, the literature is scarce and there is no clear radiological evidence of
this event, as shown in this case. This fact makes this report unique due to image
capture in cardiac MRI, demonstrating myocardial inflammation during a probable attack
of acute rheumatic fever.</p>
      <p>As for treatment, most patients with acute myocarditis respond very well to the general
measures used in acute heart failure, such as neurohumoral blocking<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. In acute attacks of rheumatic fever with
myocardial impairment, the dose used in immunosuppression and how it should be performed
are yet to be determined. Due to the rarity of cases, the best therapeutic method is
based on case reports, only. In our case there was clinical improvement after the use of
prednisone at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day for 14 days, which was reduced to 1 mg/kg/day
thereafter. The treatment time is also unknown and must be based on ventricular function
recovery associated with the reduction in inflammatory markers<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Despite all the advances in Medicine, the higher cost-effectiveness intervention in
rheumatic fever is still secondary prevention, preventing acute attacks and, thus, early
and more severe valve sequelae. Intramuscular injections of benzyl penicillin every
three weeks were able to reduce hospital admissions and are preferred to the use of oral
medication, due to its proven efficacy<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, which justified the conduct of attempting desensitization to
penicillin in this case.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it is noteworthy, based on this case report, the importance of maintaining
secondary prophylaxis even after the occurrence of valve replacement, as the acute
attack can manifest in other organs or in the heart itself, but in another segment.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="conclusions">
      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>The demonstration of probable rheumatic myocarditis in cardiac MRI makes this case
unique. The presence of an acute attack of rheumatic fever should always be considered
in young patients with a previous diagnosis and who are not receiving adequate secondary
prophylaxis. Its treatment is still uncertain, but it is based on immunosuppression and
recurrence prevention, maintaining the prophylaxis even in patients who have already
undergone valve replacement.</p>
