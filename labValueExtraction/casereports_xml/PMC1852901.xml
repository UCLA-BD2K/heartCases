					<italic>Background</italic>. Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency for which prompt diagnosis and treatment are imperative to reducing the rate of death and long-term neurologic compromise. Few cases of meningitis have been reported during pregnancy, many of which had devastating outcomes for mother, neonate, or both. <italic>Case</italic>. A 38-year-old multigravida at 35 weeks of gestation presented with mental status changes, fever, and preterm contractions. Lumbar puncture revealed gram positive cocci consistent with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Patient was intubated and admitted to ICU where she was given antibiotics and adjunctive therapy with dexamethasone. Continuous fetal monitoring was utilized throughout her course of her hospitalization. Patient was discharged home after ten days in the hospital and had an uncomplicated vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC) at 38 weeks. Both she and the infant are doing well with no permanent neurologic sequelae. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. A review of literature indicates only isolated cases of pneumococcal meningitis being described during pregnancy. An extended period of time between onset of maternal illness and delivery appears to reduce the risk of neonatal transmission and improve both maternal and fetal outcomes.</p>

      <title>1. BACKGROUND</title>
      <p>Bacterial meningitis has an annual incidence of 4&#x2013;6
cases per 100 000 adults and results in approximately 135 000
deaths worldwide each year. Since the development of the
<italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type B vaccine, the most
common bacterial pathogen for community-acquired meningitis is
<italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> which has a fatality
rate from 19% to 37%. In patients that survive the
initial insult, neurologic sequelae including seizures, hearing
loss, impaired mental status, and/or cognition may occur in as
many as 30% of all cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Local extension from contiguous extracerebral infection (e.g., otitis media, mastoiditis, or sinusitis) is a
common cause. Patients with bacterial meningitis will usually
present soon after the onset of symptoms with a classic triad of
fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status. Prompt
recognition and treatment are key steps to reducing the morbidity
and mortality associated with bacterial meningitis. In this case
report, we describe a patient who presented during the third
trimester of pregnancy with fever, mental status changes, and a
subsequent diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. We will review the
evaluation and management of this case as well as provide a
literature review of other case reports of pneumococcal
meningitis in pregnancy.</p>

      <title>2. CASE</title>
      <p>A 38-year-old multigravida with an intrauterine pregnancy at 35
weeks was found unconscious at her home and airlifted to the
nearest tertiary care center. Throughout transport and upon
arrival at the ED, her mental status alternated between combative
and lethargic and was unable to provide any coherent information
regarding her present condition or past medical history. Her
family later reported that the patient had presented to her
primary care physician five days earlier with complaints of left
otalgia and low grade fever. Treatment was initiated with
azithromycin for otitis media, but her pain continued to worsen
precipitating an emergency room visit the day before her admission
to the hospital. She received prescriptions for
amoxicillin-clavulanate and opioids at this visit but had not yet
started these medications. Her husband reported several bouts of
emesis that same evening before her changes in mental status the
following morning. Her primary obstetrician was also contacted and
she verified an uncomplicated prenatal care with a term vaginal
delivery in her first pregnancy, followed by a caesarian delivery
for breech presentation in her second pregnancy. The patient had
been counseled during this pregnancy regarding mode of delivery
and opted for repeat caesarean section at 39 weeks.</p>
      <p>On arrival in the ED, she was febrile to 38.7 C, with a pulse rate
of 152 bpm, respiratory rate of 40, blood pressure of 147/80,
and Glasgow coma score of 11 (4 for eye opening, 1 verbal, 6
movement). Fetal heart tones were noted to be 170 bpm with
reassuring variability. Uterine contractions were noted every 2-3
minutes and initial sterile vaginal exam indicated cervical
dilation of 4 cm with 50% effacement. The fetus was
vertex in presentation with a size consistent for stated
gestational age and a normal amniotic fluid index. The remainder
of the physical examination was significant for purulent drainage
from her left ear with marked erythema of both tympanic
membranes. She was also noted to have decreased breath sounds at
the base of the right lung. Complete blood count revealed a
leukocytosis of 55 000 with 70% granulocytes and
22% bands. Chest X-ray indicated a possible infiltrate in
the right middle and lower lobes. The patient was then intubated
for airway protection, sedated, and given cetriaxone (2 g q 12
hours, IV) for empiric treatment of meningitis before being sent
to the radiology suite. CT scan of the head revealed fluid
collection in the middle ear and mastoid on the left. She was
transferred to the intensive care unit and lumbar puncture
obtained with 12 750 leukoctyes (80% PMN), glucose &lt;5,
and protein of 965. Preliminary blood and cerebrospinal fluid
cultures indicated gram positive cocci in chains, consistent with
<italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Vancomycin (1 g q 24 hours,
IV) was then added for broader coverage, and dexamethasone (10
mg q 6 hours, IV) started as adjuvant therapy. Myringotomy at
bedside revealed frank purulence in the middle ear which was
evacuated and sent for culture. Continuous fetal and uterine
monitoring was initiated with an experienced labor and delivery
nurse posted at bedside for signs of fetal distress or continued
preterm labor. This comprehensive level of care was continued
until the level of sedation was decreased and the patient was
extubated. Uterine contractions ceased in regularity after the
first 24 hours with no further cervical change noted. Patient
remained intubated until hospital day eight when her mental
status had returned to baseline. At this time, she was
transferred to the antepartum floor for two additional days of
surveillance before discharge home. Final cultures from blood,
CSF, and ear were consistent with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>
with sensitivity to vancomycin. Patient completed the final four
days of a 14-day course of vancomycin and ceftriaxone at home.
Her obstetrical care was then returned to her primary
obstetrician.</p>
      <p>At 38 weeks gestation, the patient presented to her primary
obstetrician with uterine contractions and was noted to be 9 cm
dilated. She had a successful VBAC delivery of a male infant
weighing eight pounds with APGAR scores of 8 and 9, at 1 and 5
minutes, respectively. Mother and child are doing well at the
time of this writing, with no sequelae since delivery.</p>

      <title>3. CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency in which early
diagnosis and treatment is imperative to prevent death and reduce
long-term complications. Lumbar puncture is used to confirm the
diagnosis in patients presenting with clinically suspected
meningitis; however, imaging should be completed first in patients
with new-onset seizures, an immunocompromised state, signs
concerning for mass lesion or moderate-severe level of
consciousness. If imaging is to be performed before lumbar
puncture, empiric therapy should be initiated first as a delay in
treatment can result in poor outcomes. The choice of initial
antimicrobial therapy is based on the most common bacteria causing
the disease according to the patient's age and the clinical
setting and on patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility. With the
worldwide increase in the prevalence of penicillin-resistant
pneumococci, combination therapy with vancomycin plus a
third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) has
become the standard approach to empirical antimicrobial therapy.
Intravenous dexamethasone (10 mg q 6 hours for 4 days, IV)
before or with the first dose of antibiotics has been shown to
reduce the risk of death (14% versus 34%) and
neurologic disability (26% versus 52%) in adults
with pneumococcal meningitis when compared to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>In a recent prospective study, the clinical features and
prognostic factors were described in adults with bacterial
meningitis. Risk factors for an unfavorable outcome were advanced
age (&gt;60 years), presence of otitis/sinusitis, absence of rash,
low score on Glasgow coma score (&lt;8), tachycardia (&gt;120
bpm), a positive blood culture, an elevated erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (&gt;56), decreased platelet count
(&lt;180 000/mm<sup>3</sup>), low CSF white-cell count (&lt;100/mm<sup>3</sup>),
and causative species <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In the current case, the
likely mechanism for transmission of the pathogen was through
invasion of the central nervous system from a case of severe
otitis media. Hence, our patient met a minimum of six of these
ten criteria (tachycardia, otitis, absence of rash, positive
blood culture, low CSF white-cell count, <italic>S.
pneumoniae</italic>) placing her at increased risk for a poor outcome. In
addition, it is not clear what impact the state of pregnancy has
on prognosis for both mother and neonate.</p>
      <p>A review of the literature was conducted using MEDine
search and review of references cited. Key words utilized include
pregnancy, meningitis, and pneumococcal. This revealed five single
case reports and a small case series of women diagnosed with
pneumococcal meningitis during pregnancy or the postpartum period.
Lucas described 26 cases of pneumococcal meningitis in Nigerian
during pregnancy (<italic>n</italic> = 15) or the immediate postpartum period (<italic>n</italic>
= 11) during a time period from 1958 to 1962 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The overall fatality rate for
this group of women was 27% (7/26), and the rate of
neurologic sequelae in survivors at time of discharge was
53% (10/19). The type of complications included hearing
loss, severe emotional disturbance, aphasia, and hemiplegia. Of
the 15 women diagnosed during pregnancy, 3 of the mothers died
and the fetal loss rate from spontaneous abortion, stillbirth,
and neonatal death was 47% (7/15). The high incidence of
cases in Nigeria during this time period led the author to
suggest that pregnancy predisposes women to pneumococcal
meningitis. Although pregnancy does result in a diminished immune
response, there is no data to conclude that there is increased
risk specific to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>.</p>
      <p>The single patient case reports are outlined in
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). The time
interval between onset of maternal illness and the delivery of
the neonate is less than 36 hours in three cases. Each of these
cases resulted in either a fetal or maternal death, and in one
instance both mother and infant died. In the other two cases, the
time frame between onset of maternal illness and delivery was
extended with a favorable outcome for both mother and infant.
With the current case, discussion initially focused on whether it
was prudent to move towards delivery, especially in light of her
early signs of labor and her family's strong desire for a
caesarian delivery. However, continuous fetal monitoring
indicated a reassuring status throughout her hospitalization, and
all signs of preterm labor had diminished leaving no indication
for a premature delivery. It is difficult to draw conclusions from
isolated reports, but the scant literature available suggests that
an extended interval between the onset of maternal illness and
delivery provides an important window of time for maternal and
neonatal well-being.</p>
