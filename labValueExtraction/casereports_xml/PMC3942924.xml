        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>A 12-week-old female Wire-haired miniature dachshund presented with non-progressive
ataxia and hypermetria. Due to the animal&#x2019;s clinical history and symptoms, cerebellar
malformations were suspected. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) detected bilateral ventriculomegaly, dorsal displacement of the cerebellar
tentorium, a defect in the cerebellar tentorium and a large fluid-filled cystic structure
that occupied the regions where the cerebellar vermis and occipital lobes are normally
located. The abovementioned cystic structure and the defect in the cerebellar tentorium
were comparable to those seen in humans with Dandy-Walker syndrome. However, the presence
of the cystic structure in the occipital lobe region was unique to the present case.
During necropsy, the MRI findings were confirmed, but the etiology of the condition was
not determined.</p>

  <body>
    <p>A 12-week-old, female, Wire-haired miniature dachshund was referred to the Animal Medical
Center of Gifu University due to a history of non-progressive ataxia and hypermetria, which
had been present since the animal was 3-week-old, and the detection of apparent defects in the
cerebellum during a computed tomography (CT) examination. One of the dog&#x2019;s littermates
displayed skeletal malformations and had a duplicated abdominal caudal vena cava, but was
clinically normal.</p>
    <p>In a neurological examination, the dog was alert and responsive; however, it was severely
ataxic and exhibited head bobbing and wide head excursions to both sides. Accordingly, it
repeatedly fell towards both sides and could not coordinate its movements to stand or walk;
however, during brief voluntary movements, it seemed to be strong and displayed hypermetria.
Cranial nerve examinations produced unremarkable results, except for the absence of the menace
response, which might have been age-related rather than a neurological abnormality. A fundus
examination was also unremarkable, as were the dog&#x2019;s complete blood count and serum chemistry
profile.</p>
    <p>Computed tomography (Asteion Super 4<sup>&#xAE;</sup>, Toshiba, Tochigi, Japan) was repeated, and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (0.4-Tesla APERTO Eterna<sup>&#xAE;</sup>, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan)
was performed to further evaluate the cerebellar lesions.</p>
    <p>Anesthesia was induced using propofol (Mylan, Pittsburgh, PA, U.S.A.) and maintained with
isoflurane (isoflurane for animals, Mylan). CT confirmed the presence of ventriculomegaly
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>CT and MR images of the cranium and brain. A transverse CT image (A) showing bilateral
ventriculomegaly and a cystic structure that occupied the region where the cerebellar
vermis is normally found. The cystic structure extended into the occipital lobe. On a
reformatted parasagittal CT image (B), dorsal displacement of the rostral cerebellar
tentorium and a small defect in its central portion were observed. Part of the left
condyle of the occipital bone protruded into the caudal fossa. On transverse and
midsagittal T2-weighted MR images (C and D), the dilation of the fourth ventricle and
the presence of a large cystic structure in the region that normally contains the vermis
were confirmed. The cyst extended supratentorially and had displaced the occipital
lobes. The MRI signal characteristics of the cystic structure were indicative of fluid
accumulation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-75-1379-g001"/></fig>). In addition, a cystic structure was found in the region where the cerebellar vermis
is normally located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1A</xref>). A cyst was also
present in the region of the occipital lobe. The rostral cerebellar tentorium had been
displaced dorsally, probably due to compression by the cyst, and the middle portion of the
cerebellar tentorium contained a defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1B</xref>).
In addition, part of the left condyle of the occipital bone protruded into the caudal fossa.
On T2-weighted (TR=4,500 msec and TE=100 msec) fast spin-echo images of the brain, dilated
lateral and fourth ventricles were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.
1C</xref>). Furthermore, a large cystic structure occupied the region that normally contains
the vermis and extended supratentorially, displacing the occipital lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1C and 1D</xref>). On fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images
(TR=9,000 msec, TE=100 msec and TI=2,100 msec), the signal intensity of the periventricular
areas and the regions surrounding the cyst were isointense relative to the brain parenchyma,
suggesting that the pressure levels within the ventricles were not high and that the cyst had
not caused edema. The cyst exhibited high signal intensity on T2-weighted images and low
signal intensity on T1-weighted and FLAIR images. These findings were considered to be
indicative of the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid. We could not visualize the cerebellar
vermis, but both cerebellar hemispheres were subjectively considered to be within normal
limits with regard to their size and location. It was unlikely that the patient would recover;
i.e., become neurologically normal; therefore, as it would have been difficult to ensure that
the dog enjoyed a reasonable quality of life, it was euthanized and presented for necropsy.
All of the abovementioned MRI findings were confirmed in the necropsy examination. A large
fluid-filled cavity was observed in the region that normally contains the cerebellar vermis;
however, the cerebellar vermis was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig.
2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>A dorsal view of the postmortem brain specimen. Following the removal of the
fluid-filled cyst, we found that the cerebellar vermis was absent. The cerebellar
hemispheres were normal in size. The occipital lobes exhibited indentation caused by
compression by the cyst.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-75-1379-g002"/></fig>). The fluid in the cyst was grossly similar to cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, the
fluid-filled cavity extended supratentorially and displaced the occipital lobes.
Histologically, the rostral medullary velum on the dorsal surface of the mesencephalic
aqueduct was also absent, which resulted in the mesencephalic aqueduct and subarachnoid space
being connected. In addition, the ependymal cell layer lining the fourth ventricle had merged
into the pia mater of each cerebellar hemisphere. A thin membranous structure, which was an
extension of the arachnoid mater, formed the wall of the cyst. There were no histological
abnormalities including inflammatory reactions in the rest of the cerebellum or other areas of
the brain. <italic>In utero</italic> parvovirus infections have been known to cause cerebellar
hypoplasia in dogs and cats [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, we
subjected tissue samples from the cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem to the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) for parvovirus DNA. However, the results were negative for all tissues
tested.</p>
    <p>In the present case, the absence of the cerebellar vermis and the cystic dilation of the
fourth ventricle were comparable to the changes seen in humans with Dandy-Walker syndrome
(DWS). DWS is a congenital cerebellar abnormality, which affects children and is characterized
by hypoplasia or agenesis of the cerebellar vermis, cystic dilatation of the fourth ventricle
and expansion of the posterior fossa [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In humans,
other conditions, such as hydrocephalus, narrowing of the mesencephalic aqueduct, the absence
of the corpus callosum, heterotopia of the cerebrum and/or cerebellum, microgyria, cerebellar
meningoceles and syringomyelia, can occur concurrently with DWS [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; however, no such abnormalities were found in the present case. The
present patient fitted the profile of DWS; i.e., it had a defect that affected part of its
cerebellar tentorium and a cyst that extended supratentorially. However, the continuity
between the cysts in the cerebellar vermis and occipital lobe regions could not be determined
definitively during necropsy, as the occipital bone was inadvertently removed which led to a
rupture of the cysts.</p>
    <p>In animals, congenital cerebellar abnormalities similar to those seen in humans with DWS have
been reported in cows, horses, sheep, dogs and a cat. Among dogs, multiple breeds have been
reported to suffer from such abnormalities, including Labrador retrievers, Bull terriers,
Weimaraners, Dachshunds, Cocker spaniels, Boston terriers, Golden retrievers, Miniature
schnauzers, Chow chows, Briards, Belgian Tervurens, Silky terriers and mixed breeds [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In these
cases, the degree of cerebellar vermis malformation varied from hypoplasia to complete
agenesis.</p>
    <p>The etiology of the present patient&#x2019;s cerebellar malformations was not determined. Although
cerebellar hypoplasia in dogs has been linked with parvovirus infection [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], there was no evidence of infection in our case. Cerebellar
abnormalities, such as those mentioned above, have been suggested to possess a heritable
component in dogs [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In our patient, since no histological evidence of neuronal degeneration or
inflammation was identified, congenital defects (possibly hereditary defects) were suspected,
but not confirmed. In humans, <italic>ZIC1</italic> and <italic>ZIC4</italic> have been
identified as causative genes of DWS [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and the
deletion of <italic>ZIC1</italic> and <italic>ZIC4</italic> in a mouse DWS model resulted in
decreased postnatal granule cell progenitor proliferation and the disruption of anterior
vermis foliation [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
    <p>The CT and MRI findings of the present case were comparable to those seen in humans with DWS.
CT imaging helped us to determine the extent of the patient&#x2019;s congenital defects; however, low
magnetic field MRI was able to precisely depict the anatomical changes induced by the
condition, which were confirmed at necropsy. In addition, the supratentorial extension of the
cyst was a unique finding of the present case. There was no evidence of an <italic>in
utero</italic> parvovirus infection and so congenital defects were suspected to be
responsible for the dog&#x2019;s condition, although its precise etiology remains unknown.</p>
