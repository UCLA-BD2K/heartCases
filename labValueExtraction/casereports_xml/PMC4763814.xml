        <p>Biliary atresia (BA) is classically described at the neonatal age. However, rare
cases of BA in older infants have also been reported. We report four cases of
late-onset BA in infants older than 4 weeks (3 males, 1 female), and describe the
diagnostic and management difficulties. One of the cases had a late-onset (29 weeks)
presentation with a successful surgical procedure. We highlight the importance of
this unusual differential diagnosis in infants with cholestatic syndrome, who may
benefit from Kasai surgery, regardless of age.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Biliary atresia (BA) is still a challenge for clinicians and researchers. This disease
is classically described in neonates and its early diagnosis is fundamental for a better
prognosis (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Viral etiological agents, such as
cytomegalovirus, defects in morphogenesis of the biliary tree, and genetic, epigenetic,
ischemic, inflammatory, immune, and even toxic factors (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), alone or combined, have been
implicated in the etiopathogenesis of BA. However, the mechanisms of BA are still
largely unknown. BA commonly manifests in the first month of life. Nevertheless,
late-onset forms, as well as successful Kasai portoenterostomy procedures in older
children, have been observed (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), reflecting the
heterogeneous nature of BA. Yang et al. (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)
classified BA according to the time of onset of symptoms as early-onset and late-onset
forms. They defined these early- and late-onset forms as cholestatic jaundice and fecal
hypocholia before and after 2 weeks of life, respectively.</p>
      <p>In this report, we describe four cases of late-onset BA in infants older than 4 weeks
and their histopathological findings. We highlight the importance of this diagnosis in
infants with cholestatic syndrome and the diagnostic and management difficulties. Our
findings reinforce that failure of early diagnosis may result in delayed indication of
optimal surgical procedures.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Case Reports</title>
      <p>All cases of BA originated from patients who were treated between 2006 and 2012 at the
Departamento de Pediatria, Faculdade de Ci&#xEA;ncias M&#xE9;dicas, Universidade Estadual de
Campinas (FCM, UNICAMP), Campinas, SP, Brazil. The present report was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the Departamento de Pediatria, FCM, UNICAMP, Brazil. After chart
analyses and case descriptions, histological slides were reviewed independently by two
pathologists.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>Case 1</title>
        <p>This patient was a male infant, aged 31 weeks and 1 day, with a history of jaundice,
choluria, and fecal hypocholia that had begun 2 weeks prior. The infant was born at
40 weeks of gestational age, weighed 3600 g, and had no history of neonatal jaundice
or other comorbid conditions. The mother had gestational diabetes and was exclusively
treated with diet. Baseline biochemical tests were consistent with cholestatic
syndrome (baseline biochemical tests of all four cases are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>). Serology for cytomegalovirus was
negative. Abdominal ultrasound at admission to the hospital showed an enlarged liver,
with slightly heterogeneous parenchyma, a distended gallbladder, and dilatation of
the intrahepatic and extrahepatic systems. After an inconclusive clinical
investigation, the infant underwent exploratory laparotomy at 37 weeks and 1 day old.
We observed a gallbladder with a thin and distended wall, adherence of the intestinal
loops to the hilum of the liver, and an indurated, fibrotic, extrahepatic bile duct
system. Transoperative cholangiography showed that there was failure to fill at the
junction of the hepatic ducts and a lack of drainage to the small intestine. Kasai
portoenterostomy was the treatment of choice. The infant showed significant clinical
improvement and normalization of bilirubin levels 1 week after surgery. He is
currently asymptomatic after 65 months of follow-up.</p>

</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Case 2</title>
        <p>This patient was a male infant, aged 17 weeks and 4 days, with a history of isolated
jaundice since 8 weeks of life. There were no complications in prenatal care. The
infant was born at 40 weeks and 2 days of gestational age, and weighed 3150 g.
Baseline clinical investigations showed an isolated increase in direct bilirubin
serum levels, a liver with a heterogeneous parenchyma, and a non-contractile
gallbladder on abdominal ultrasound. Serology for cytomegalovirus was negative.
Percutaneous liver biopsy was performed, with histopathological findings consistent
with BA, at a stage of focal nodular transformation. Because of the older age at
onset and the atypical clinical picture for BA, primary sclerosing cholangitis was
initially considered. Final diagnosis was dependent on findings at exploratory
laparotomy, which showed a macroscopically normal gallbladder, an extrahepatic
biliary system, as well as the usual appearance of the liver. Transoperative
cholangiography revealed a minute streak of contrast material ascending the
intrahepatic bile duct system. We decided to interrupt the Kasai operation and only
perform cholecystectomy and wedge biopsy of the liver. The child rapidly progressed
to liver cirrhosis and the diagnosis of biliary atresia was considered at this
moment. The child deteriorated before transplantation was attempted.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Case 3</title>
        <p>This patient was a male infant, aged 14 weeks, with clinical presentation of
jaundice, choluria, and fecal hypocholia for 2 weeks. The infant was born at 39 weeks
gestational age and weighed 3320 g. He presented with jaundice on the second day of
life, was treated with phototherapy, and discharged from the hospital with
improvement of symptoms. The mother had a history of deep venous thrombosis and used
prophylactic heparin during pregnancy. On initial investigation, biochemical tests
were typical of cholestatic syndrome. Serology for cytomegalovirus was negative.
Abdominal ultrasound failed to visualize the gallbladder during fasting. Percutaneous
liver biopsy was attempted without success. Our treatment of choice was exploratory
laparotomy at 15 weeks and 4 days of age. This procedure showed the gallbladder and
extrahepatic bile duct systems with total atresia. Kasai portoenterostomy was
performed. After surgery, there was partial improvement of clinical and laboratory
parameters, and the infant received referral for liver transplantation, which was
performed at another hospital. He was lost to follow-up immediately after the
procedure.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Case 4</title>
        <p>This patient was a female infant, aged 9 weeks and 4 days, with clinical presentation
of jaundice, choluria, and fecal hypocholia, with an onset of 5 weeks. Prenatal care
showed no complications. She was born at a gestational age of 39 weeks, weighed 2625
g, and had no comorbid conditions. Baseline biochemical tests were consistent with
cholestatic syndrome. Serology for cytomegalovirus was negative. Abdominal ultrasound
revealed a hypoplastic gallbladder and a liver with a normal aspect. Percutaneous
liver biopsy showed histopathological findings typical of BA. Exploratory laparotomy
at 10 weeks and 5 days old showed atresia of the extrahepatic bile duct system, an
intensely hypoplastic gallbladder, and an enlarged, firm, micronodular liver. After
surgery, the infant progressed with partial improvement in clinical and laboratory
parameters. She was referred for liver transplantation, which was performed at
another hospital, and was lost to follow-up afterward.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>All liver biopsies that were obtained during exploratory laparotomy exhibited a
morphological pattern typical of large bile duct obstruction, with severe portal biliary
reaction, ductal, intracanalicular, and hepatocytic cholestasis, and cholatestasis. We
also observed focal nodular regeneration and giant cell transformation of some sparse
hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). Thickening of the portal
branches of the hepatic artery was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure
2</xref>). Case 1 exhibited type 2 porta hepatis (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), a common bile duct with ductal lumens in the midst of loose fibrous
tissue, and a gallbladder with considerable luminal dilatation. Case 3 also demonstrated
type 2 porta hepatis, associated with chronic inflammation, with an extrahepatic biliary
system and a gallbladder with complete atresia. In case 4, biliary remnants were not
visualized, raising the question as to whether it was type 1 porta hepatis or an
artifact. The gallbladder showed the usual histological aspect as in cases 2 and 4.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Since 1959, Kasai portoenterostomy has been the only treatment, with the exception of
liver transplantation, that effectively changes the prognosis of patients with BA.
Several studies have sought objective clinical, histopathological, laboratory, or
imaging criteria that could help in treatment decision-making and have prognostic value
in children with BA. In this context, whether there is an age limit for the Kasai
procedure is unknown. Large series have associated the success of this surgery to the
age of the patients; the younger the patient, the better the prognosis. However, because
BA has a higher incidence in neonates, these results might have been biased against
analysis of age alone. This is probably because in several cases undergoing late
surgery, diagnosis had been made at an advanced stage of disease. BA is currently
accepted as a heterogeneous disease, with various forms of clinical presentation.
Therefore, the distinction between &#x201C;late diagnosis&#x201D; and &#x201C;late onset&#x201D; of BA may be
important. Late-onset forms with a shorter duration of disease are likely to have a
favorable outcome after the Kasai procedure, even when the patient is older.
Nevertheless, there are also case reports with a late diagnosis where the patient
benefitted from the Kasai operation (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our four cases did not have the same outcome. The first case was unusual because the
child was 31 weeks old and ultrasound at admission showed intra- and extrahepatic bile
duct dilatation. This finding is only observed in approximately 5% of biliary atresia
patients with obstruction at the common bile duct (<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The initial differential diagnosis did not include BA. To the best of our
knowledge, there are no similar reports of onset of BA later than 29 weeks of life.
Diagnosis was made by transoperative cholangiography and supported by histopathological
findings. Even at an older age, the Kasai procedure was the treatment of choice. The
child had a favorable clinical course and continues to be asymptomatic until the present
date. Clinical features of case 1 suggest an acquired form of BA, which can be
associated with perforation of biliary tracts, as described by Davenport et al. (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, there were no signs of bile duct
perforation or a history of surgical manipulation. The morphological findings were
characteristic of isolated biliary atresia.</p>
      <p>In contrast, in case 2, the infant did not undergo Kasai surgery, even with previous
histopathological findings suggestive of BA. The clinical diagnosis was primary
sclerosing cholangitis because of the atypical clinical picture of jaundice at 8 weeks
of life, low serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels, and the absence of fecal
hypocholia. The final diagnosis depended exclusively on surgical findings and
cholangiography that was performed during exploratory laparotomy. In this case,
transoperative cholangiography showed a minute streak of contrast medium ascending the
intrahepatic bile duct system. This finding was interpreted by the surgeon as
information that ruled out the diagnosis of BA. This infant progressed with liver
cirrhosis and its complications, and missed the opportunity for an effective Kasai
procedure. The image shown by cholangiography most probably represented the evolutionary
stage of the disease, with partial obstruction of the bile duct system. This case
highlights the difficulties in diagnosing BA, also demonstrating variability in
transoperative cholangiography findings, which are considered the gold standard for
diagnosis. The third and fourth cases, even at older ages and with approximately 4 and 6
weeks of symptoms, respectively, underwent Kasai portoenterostomy. However, the outcome
was unfavorable and the infants were referred to the surgical service for liver
transplantation.</p>
      <p>Common morphological alterations of BA in liver biopsy specimens include a periportal
ductular reaction, cholestasis, and portal expansion with edematous fibroplasia, in
addition to fibrous septa and nodules in advanced stages. Findings such as ductal plate
malformation have also been observed in some cases, suggesting an intrauterine insult in
the physiopathogenesis of BA, but with no prognostic significance. Some researchers have
described thickening of the median layer of the portal branches of the hepatic artery as
part of the histopathological criteria of BA (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). A morphometric and
immunohistochemical study on angiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth factor A)
also supported this observation, suggesting that ischemia/hypoxia phenomena participate
in the etiopathogenesis of BA (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). An
angiographic study in patients with BA showed alterations in branches of the hepatic
artery, such as tortuosities, formation of vascular arterial tuft-like lesions, and
occlusion of peripheral arterial branches, suggesting that these findings may be
characteristic of BA (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Furthermore, an
increase in the resistance index of the hepatic artery, measured by Doppler ultrasound,
has been associated with a worse prognosis in patients with BA (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p>
      <p>Classification of BA has experienced several modifications throughout the years and is
inconsistent among researchers. Two clinical presentations of BA have been classically
described (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). One presentation is embryonic BA,
characterized by persistent jaundice at birth, associated with non-hepatic congenital
structural alterations, also called the early, fetal, or syndromic form. The other
presentation is perinatal BA, with a jaundice-free interval at birth, is present alone,
and is also called the late or non-syndromic form. Davenport et al. proposed a new term
of &#x201C;biliary atresia splenic malformation syndrome&#x201D; and defined clinical criteria for the
forms of embryonic BA (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). New clinical forms,
supported by imaging and laboratory tests, and prognostic characteristics have emerged,
such as a cystic BA and a form associated with cytomegalovirus infection (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). An acquired form of BA, secondary to perforation
of the extrahepatic biliary system or previous surgical manipulation, has been described
with the same morphological findings (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The
question of why the acquired form of BA does not develop in older children, or in
adults, remains unanswered. Variability of frequently superimposed clinical
presentations that are difficult to classify reinforces the hypothesis that BA
represents a group of disorders with distinct etiopathogenic mechanisms. All of these
disorders have the final pathway of progressive destructive inflammatory obliterative
cholangiopathy in common.</p>
      <p>In summary, we describe four late-onset cases of BA, highlighting the importance of this
differential diagnosis not only in neonates, but also in infants with cholestatic
syndrome. Every case should be evaluated, based on clinical, laboratory,
histopathological, surgical, and imaging criteria, which are highly variable. BA is
still a disease with many unanswered questions, and its diagnosis can be a challenge.
Therefore, the experience of the reference center is extremely important. Management
should be individualized, regardless of the age of the patient. We are currently
performing a morphometric study of the portal branches of the hepatic artery in all
cases with wedged liver biopsy in our service. We hope to understand the actual
associations between these morphologic data and BA, its clinical forms, and the time of
disease.</p>
