        <p>Cases in which teeth have only the cervical third remaining from orthodontically
induced external root resorption, cast the following doubts: 1) What care should be
taken to keep these teeth in mouth with the least risk possible? 2) What care should

accurately determining cervical root and bone loss? 3) Why is not endodontic
treatment recommended in these cases? The present study aims at shedding light on the

  <body>
    <p>Tooth resorption is present in 5 to 10% of the general population who has never been
subjected to orthodontic treatment. It has been considered the major cause of tooth loss;
however, considerable confusion remains with regards to diagnosis of the different types of
tooth resorption.</p>
    <p>Dental trauma is the major cause of tooth resorption leading to tooth loss. Nevertheless,
from an epidemiological standpoint, its most frequent cause is orthodontic treatment which
hardly ever induces resorption leading to tooth loss. Thus, the present study aims at
discussing the following issues so as to provide guidelines for future clinical
protocols:</p>
    <p>
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x25C6; In which case teeth reabsorbed during orthodontic treatment are considered
lost?</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x25C6; What is the limit of resorption-induced root tooth loss required for extraction?
</p></list-item></list>
</p>
    <sec>
      <title>Orthodontically induced resorption is always inflammatory</title>
      <p>Tooth resorption is grouped according to seven different criteria,<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> each one of which assigns an appropriate and distinct term for a
number of categories. In terms of mechanism of occurrence, tooth resorption is mainly
classified into two types as follows: </p>
      <p>1 - <bold>Inflammatory resorption:</bold> When, in the process of resorption,
periodontal space and ligament remain inflamed and act as the source of mediators for
the cells to resorb mineralized root tissue. The major causes of inflammatory resorption
are orthodontic movement, periapical periodontitis, trauma and inside bleaching. </p>
      <p>From a cellular standpoint, the cause of periodontal inflammatory process leads to local
cementoblasts death, even though periodontal ligament vitality is preserved and so are
the epithelial rests of Malassez - the structure responsible for keeping the periodontal
space uniform, thereby avoiding alveolodental ankylosis. Orthodontic treatment induces
this type of resorption.</p>
      <p>2 - <bold>Replacement resorption:</bold> This type of resorption only occurs as a result
of alveolodental ankylosis resulting from trauma of erupted teeth or severe atrophy of
the periodontal ligament in unerupted teeth. Teeth undergoing alveolodental ankylosis
are considered a bone structure. For this reason, they are subjected to constant renewal
processes and remodeling, and are replaced by bone. Alveolodental ankylosis only occurs
in the event of death of epithelial rests of Malassez, an epithelial structure of the
periodontal ligament which is not affected by orthodontic treatment.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Root is reabsorbed by periodontal ligament!</title>
      <p>Except for cases of internal resorption (a specific form of resorption that represents
pulp pathosis), teeth are always reabsorbed by the periodontal ligament. Resorptive
cells have access to mineralized dental tissues via periodontal ligament which also
consists of resorptive cells.</p>
      <p>In external tooth resorption, the pulp does not undergo any inflammatory, aging or
mineralization processes. Additionally, it does not show any symptoms or potential for
necrosis. In other words: Removing the pulp during endodontic treatment does not affect
speed and severity of external tooth resorption induced by orthodontic movement.
Endodontic post-treatment phase might be a complicating factor due to providing risk of
contamination and filling material overflow in cases of orthodontically-induced
resorption.</p>
      <p>Endodontic treatment interferes in tooth resorption induced by inflammatory processes
caused by bacteria in the root canal and/or dentin tubules. In these cases, endodontic
treatment does imply in eliminating or controlling the cause of resorption. </p>
      <p>Using calcium hydroxide to endodontically treat teeth with external root resorption
induced by chronic periapical periodontitis or pulp necrosis - including by-products
adhered to the root structure - implies in making good use of its antimicrobial and
anti-inflammatory properties, especially its alkalizing effect. This is due to the
bacteria that characterize this microbiota, as they tend to prefer acid environments to
proliferate and metabolize. Calcium hydroxide alkalizing effect is temporary and does
not interfere in other resorptive activities, except for microorganism-induced
inflammation.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Periodontal support: essentially cervical!</title>
      <p>Tooth root apex accounts for 10% of periodontal support. Thus, losing the apical third
does not significantly affect periodontal support. This explains why some researches on
orthodontic techniques and other variables yield final outcomes with apparently severe
apical loss which is not subject to questioning by scientific reviewers. One might
assert, from a periodontal support standpoint, that the apex is unimportant.</p>
      <p>The middle third of the root accounts for 30% of periodontal support. This means that a
tooth with half root preserved remains with 70% of periodontal support. Conversely, the
cervical third of the root accounts for 60% of periodontal support due to being of
greater proportions, with greater diameter and circumferential perimeter. Nature might
have designed it this way to compensate for greater alveolar bone elasticity or
deformation capacity in a more cervical level, which provides the tooth-bone complex
with greater stability.</p>
      <p>In practical terms, this means that a tooth with only the cervical third of the root
left might perfectly remain in one's mouth, performing its masticatory, speech and
esthetic functions without increased mobility or further gingival alterations. </p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>What is the best procedure for teeth with only the cervical third left?</title>
      <p>Once again: In practical terms, a tooth with only the cervical third of the root left
might perfectly remain in one's mouth, performing its masticatory, speech and esthetic
functions without increased mobility or further gingival and color alterations.</p>
      <p>From a preventive point of view, the clinician must ask the patient to do the following: </p>
      <p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Avoid grasping food with your teeth, only, so as to prevent excessive tension.
</p></list-item><list-item><p>Use individual acrylic plates while sleeping so as to ensure that forces
exerted by clenching and/or bruxism during sleep concentrate on some teeth,
only. </p></list-item><list-item><p>Use a mouthpiece while doing sports, since teeth might undergo avulsion even if
exposed to minor trauma. </p></list-item><list-item><p>In order to prevent further issues, a retainer should be used so that, in the
event of trauma or negligence in day-to-day life, these short-rooted teeth have
greater strength.</p></list-item></list>
</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Endodontic treatment should not be performed in these cases!</title>
      <p>Teeth with severely resorbed roots must never be subjected to endodontic treatment with
a view to stopping resorption or rendering the tooth resistant to it: That does not
occur!</p>
      <p>When faced with emergency situations, many clinicians lose control over logical and
biological reasoning, and randomly appeal to all possible alternatives, even improper
and ineffective ones. </p>
      <p>Orthodontically induced resorption is controlled if force is removed: After seven days,
there will be no more clasts, and after four to five weeks, the entire root surface will
be restored with new cementum and periodontal fibers. Root resorption is achieved by
periodontal ligament, not by dental pulp. Endodontic treatment is useless in these
situations. After six weeks, tooth length stability is restored.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>From a periodontal point of view</title>
      <p>Should there be tooth mobility, it does not result from tooth resorption. Tooth mobility
might be caused by:</p>
      <p>
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x25C6; Orthodontic forces, whether active or residual. </p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x25C6; Occlusal trauma superimposed over resorptive processes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x25C6; Cervical bone loss of orthodontic and iatrogenic nature. </p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x25C6; Exuberant cervical bone loss associated with periodontal disease or occlusal
trauma.</p></list-item></list>
</p>
      <p>To correct tooth mobility, its cause must be detected and properly solved. Should the
pulp be vital, it must not be subjected to endodontic treatment due to potential
mobility; unless pulp and periapical space need to be handled for surgical purposes.

      <title>Imaging aspects of root resorption and cervical bone</title>
      <p>Surprisingly, periapical radiograph is more reliable than tomography in cases requiring
precise details. </p>
      <p>Thinner cortical bones and delicate trabeculae tend not to appear in tomographic slices
or panoramic radiographs. A thorough analysis comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figures 1 to 6</xref> illustrates such a fact. </p>

      <title>Clinical case analysis</title>
      <p>A mongoloid, 25-year-old male patient sought orthodontic treatment after being subjected
to a four-year therapy, as revealed by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figures 1 to
7</xref>. Although he had most roots with severe resorption (Malmgren's grade
4),<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> no teeth should have been extracted or
submitted to endodontic procedures. Nevertheless, three maxillary incisors underwent
endodontic treatment which, in fact, does not affect root prognosis. </p>
      <p>Dental pulp does not influence external resorption. Similarly, intracanal dressing does
not interfere in the cause of resorptive processes while active forces remain.
Conversely, removing forces does cause resorptive processes to stop in such a way that
no more clasts are found on the root surface after a week.</p>
      <p>During the first appointment, after four years of previous orthodontic treatment,
patient's teeth did not show increased mobility. Occlusion assessment revealed absence
of incisal guidance and Class III relationship between canines and molars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f07">Fig 7</xref>). As stated by the patient, there was an
ongoing attempt to correct Class III by means of elastics: Intermittent forces such as
those exerted by intermaxillary elastics might favor root resorption during orthodontic
treatment. </p>
      <p>
<fig id="f07" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Clinical dental and gingival aspects of patient presenting with severe
inflammatory root resorption (Malmgren's grade 4) after four years of
orthodontic treatment.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="dpjo-19-05-00019-gf07"/></fig>
</p>
      <p>The orthodontic appliance was not removed and occlusal adjustment was carried out to
improve occlusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f08">Fig 8</xref>). After three months of
assessment and once new occlusal wear was carried out, the brackets were removed and the
patient subjected to quarterly, semestral and annual control. </p>
      <p>
<fig id="f08" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Clinical aspect after occlusal adjustment: incisal guidance and improved
canines and molars occlusion.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="dpjo-19-05-00019-gf08"/></fig>

</p>
      <p>Occlusal interference associated with tissue lesions caused by occlusal trauma might
lead to increased tooth mobility and ongoing root resorption, even after orthodontic
forces are removed.</p>
      <p>Considering the severity of root resorption and the conditions of remnant cervical root
(responsible for 60% of periodontal support), the following procedures must be
followed:</p>
      <p>1<sup>st</sup> Teeth can remain in function and esthetics for an indefinite period of
time without endodontic treatment, except for cases in which endodontic therapy is
exclusively required. In the case reported herein, endodontic treatment proved
unnecessary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figs 1 and 3</xref>).</p>
      <p>2<sup>nd</sup> Occlusion must be thoroughly balanced without further interference.
Should there be any type of interference, they must be immediately corrected as in the
case reported herein. </p>
      <p>3<sup>rd</sup> The patient should be advised to use a mouthpiece while practicing
sports. In the event of a trauma occurs, clinicians should follow the same procedure
employed for teeth without root shortening. </p>
      <p>4<sup>th</sup> Making patients aware that while eating, they should avoid grasping hard
food, such as some fruit or bread, with their teeth, only. </p>
      <p>5<sup>th</sup> In cases of bruxism, even if mild and occasional, the patient should
ideally, routinely and methodically use individual acrylic plates while sleeping.</p>
      <p>6<sup>th</sup> Since roots are too short, tooth movement should be avoided.</p>
      <p>7<sup>th</sup> Should movement be exclusively orthopedic without involving compromised
teeth and their anchorage, the periodontal ligament is not affected by inflammation or
stress. In other words, orthopedic movement does not induce a new cycle of root
resorption.</p>
      <p>8<sup>th</sup> Chronic inflammatory periodontal disease associated with dental plaque
must be prevented by properly advising the patient about oral hygiene. Minor cervical
bone loss is utterly significant. </p>
      <p>9<sup>th</sup> Fully or partially unerupted teeth must be extracted, especially if they
are too near other teeth which might not only lead to root resorption, but also hinder
the case due to orthodontic reasons.</p>
      <p>10<sup>th</sup> Parafunctional habits, such as onychophagia, object grasping with teeth,
labial or lingual piercings, must be corrected and avoided.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>How probable is tooth loss? When should a retainer be used?</title>
      <p>Should the aforementioned care be taken, the probability of tooth loss is significantly
reduced. Likewise, should proper care be taken, the need for a retainer is also reduced. </p>
      <p>Should there be tooth mobility, the clinician must question its causes which might be
related to occlusal trauma, chronic inflammatory periodontal disease or cervical bone
loss associated with root resorption. In these cases, the cause must be eliminated and
potential sequelae corrected. Importantly, tooth mobility might be among such sequelae;
however, not due to root resorption in which case the use of a retainer is
necessary.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Where do pulp and periodontal ligament cells of resorbed roots go to?</title>
      <p>Pulp and periodontal ligament are special connective tissues that undergo renewal
processes during the day, in addition to adapting to the demands of each area. </p>
      <p>Connective tissue cells are stable and, whenever faced with mediators such as normal
growth factors, join the cell cycle and are differentiated into similar cells,
(fibroblasts, osteoblasts and chondroblasts) via mitosis. Some of those cells are
undifferentiated or pre-differentiated, and have great differentiation capacity for
other morphologies and functions.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Final considerations</title>
      <p>Teeth with only the cervical third remaining from orthodontically induced external root
resorption must remain in one's mouth with function and esthetics preserved. In these
cases, endodontic treatment is not recommended for affected teeth because the pulp is
not involved in the process and the post-treatment phase of endodontic therapy might be
a complicating factor due to risks of accidental contamination or filling material
overflow. </p>
      <p>Accurate diagnosis of causes and stages of development, in addition to occlusal trauma
control and oral hygiene as well as the use of a mouthpiece to avoid trauma and acrylic
plates to correct bruxism are part of the protocol recommended to treat cases of extreme
root resorption associated with induced tooth movement. </p>
      <p>Additionally, care should be taken with regards to reading of imaging exams, since
tomography does not accurately reveal minor details of thin cortical bone and
trabeculae. Periapical radiograph, on the other hand, provides precise details,
especially in terms of detecting cervical bone and root loss. </p>
      <p>Should proper care be taken by clinicians and patients, the chances of tooth loss in
extreme cases of root resorption associated with induced tooth movement are reduced.</p>
