    <p><bold>Clinical Data:</bold> After surgical correction of the transposition of the great
arteries associated with other defects and heart failure, beginning with termino-terminal
coartectomy and pulmonary artery banding at three months (weight = 3800 g) and use of the
Jatene technique with the closing off of interventricular communication, and pulmonary
banding at ten months (weight = 5200 g), the patient progressed well, recovering weight and
remaining symptom-free, despite the appearance of pulmonary artery stenosis at five years
of age, improved after dilation by balloon catheter and resulting in a reduction in the
pressure gradient, down from 72 mmHg to 26 mmHg. Since then, she has been taking 40 mg/day
of propranolol for slight but persistent stenosis of the right ventricular outflow tract.
She currently tolerates routine exercises well and does not mention symptoms.</p>
    <p><bold>Physical Examination:</bold> Good general condition, eupneic, acyanotic, normal
pulse. Weight: 73 kg. Height: 156 cm. Right Arm Blood Pressure (RABP) and Right Leg Blood
Pressure (RLBP) = 130/80 mm Hg. Heart rate (HR): 73 bpm. The aorta was not palpated and
there is a mild systolic murmur at the suprasternal notch.</p>
    <p>In the precordium, the <italic>ictus cordis</italic> was not palpated and there were no
systolic impulses. The heart sounds were normophonetic, auscultating a moderate systolic
murmur of ++ intensity, harsh, on the upper left sternal edge. The liver was not palpated
and the lungs were clear.</p>

      <title>Supplementary Examinations</title>
      <p><bold>Electrocardiogram: </bold>showed the sinus rhythm, with no signs of overload,
unaltered since the correction of the defects. Electrical axis of P wave (PA): +50&#xBA;.
Electrical axis of the QRS complex (QRSA): +70&#xBA;. Electrical axis of the T wave (TA):
+70&#xBA; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

      <p><bold>Chest X-ray: </bold>showed the cardiac area as normal, with the pulmonary vascular
network also normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">figure 1</xref>).</p>
      <p><bold>Echocardiogram:</bold> showed cardiac cavities with normal dimensions with no
myocardial hypertrophy (septum &#x2212; posterior wall = 10 mm) and a 40 mmHg pressure gradient
in the right ventricular outflow tract. A pressure gradient was detected in the
descending aorta.</p>
      <p><bold>Chest Tomography of the Aorta:</bold> showed mild hypertrophy of the right
ventricle, slight dilation in the aortic isthmus region at the location of the previous
coarctation correction, and normal biventricular function. The dilation of the ascending
neoaorta persists, due to the dilated pulmonary artery, subject to hyperflow over a
lengthy period of time, pre-operative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure
2</xref>).</p>

          <p>Chest tomography clearly shows the dilation of the ascending aorta (neoaorta) and
the aortic isthmus region (remains of the coarctation correction), as well as the
slight subpulmonary stenosis in the right ventricle (arrow) at A and the two
transposed coronary arteries in the ascending neoaorta at B, where both ventricles
are similar in size and with the right ventricle being slightly hypertrophied at
C, D and E (arrow).</p>

      <p><bold>Clinical Diagnosis: </bold>Transposition of the great arteries associated with
interventricular communication and aortic coarctation corrected in stages, with good
late post-operative progress and with mild stenosis in the right ventricular outflow
tract.</p>
      <p><bold>Clinical Reasoning: </bold>The clinical elements of her progress were compatible
with the diagnosis of a slight obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract.
Despite the clear systolic murmur and the pressure gradient of 40 mmHg found in the
echocardiogram, the absence of right ventricle potentials in the electrocardiogram
attests to the slight repercussion of the dynamic obstruction.</p>
      <p><bold>Differential Diagnosis:</bold> After anatomical correction of the transposition of
the great arteries, neopulmonary stenosis was found more frequently among patients
undergoing surgery in the early days of this technique, with most of them requiring
surgical expansion of the obstruction. Dilation by balloon catheter was rarely
effective, as also occurred in this case. The continuation of dynamic subpulmonary
stenosis became an element for differential diagnosis with native anomalies in this
region that are hard to distinguish.</p>
      <p><bold>Conduit:</bold> Watchful clinical conduct was adopted, guided by the 40 mmHg
pressure gradient and normal electrocardiogram, as expressions of the slight
repercussion of the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.</p>
      <p><bold>Remarks: </bold>Post-operative progress after the correction of the transposition
of the great arteries, despite associated defects such as interventricular communication
and aortic coarctation, has proven adequate even over the long term, as shown in this
case report. Complications in progress after anatomical correction using the Jatene
technique, such as pulmonary artery stenosis, coronary obstruction and aortic
insufficiency, have become increasingly rare, due to appropriate technical alterations
over time. The progress of this patient underscores the normalization of anatomical and
functional elements found in the transposition of the great arteries. This is why this
congenital defect has become a condition with an anatomical and functional cure, despite
belonging to the cyanogenic anomalies group and with marked prior hemodynamic disorders.
This case exemplifies adequate progress noted after anatomical correction through the
Jatene technique over the long term.</p>
