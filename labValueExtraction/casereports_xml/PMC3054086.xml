        <p>Secretory meningioma have been described as a distinct variant of meningioma based on their histologic, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features of epithelial and secretory differentiation of meningothelial cells with accumulation of secretory material in the form of hyaline inclusion. Secretory meningioma is also a benign tumor having similar biological behaviour to that of typical meningiomas: hence, it is important for it to be recognized and diagnosed correctly to avoid unnecessary radiation and chemotherapy. Here we present a case of secretory meningioma with typical morphologic features. The patient was a 56-year-old woman with bilateral visual disturbance. A well-circumscribed mass was present in the left frontal lobe of cerebrum with surrounding edema. The tumor was composed of whorls of meningothelial cells and abundant intra- and extracellular eosinophilic hyaline inclusions which showed immunoreactivity for epithelial membrane antigen(EMA) and carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA). Ultrastructural features also supported epithelial and secretory differentiation of tumor cells.</p>
