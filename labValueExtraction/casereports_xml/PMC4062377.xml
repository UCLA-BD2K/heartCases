    <p><bold>Clinical data:</bold> Chest radiography performed during upper respiratory tract
infection at 5 months of age suggested heart disease because of a deformity observed in
the ventricular arch. At that time, echocardiography confirmed the presence of two tumor
masses in both ventricles. At nine months of age, the patient started to present with
episodes of paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia, with a heart rate of approximately 200
bpm, accompanied by diaphoresis and paleness, all reverted after electrical
cardioversion. The episodes recurred for five times, despite the systematic use of
antiarrhythmic medication comprising propranolol and amiodarone.</p>
    <p><bold>Physical examination:</bold> Active, eupneic, mucous membranes pink, normal pulses.
Weight: 17 kg. Height: 97 cm. BP: 90/52-61 mmHg. HR: 100 bpm. Aorta non-palpable in the
suprasternal notch area.</p>
    <p>No deformities were observed in the precordium; the apical impulse was not palpable and
there were no systolic impulses. The heart sounds were normal with no murmurs. The liver
was not palpable.</p>

      <title>Laboratory tests</title>
      <p><bold>Electrocardiogram</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>)
showed normal sinus rhythm and signs of left ventricular overload. QR complex in aVL
with negative T wave in aVL and isoelectric in D1 were observed, thus characterizing
the diagnosis of electrical ischemia of the high lateral wall. AP: +60&#xBA;. AQRS: +80&#xBA;.
AT: +90&#xBA;. During an episode of tachycardia, ECG showed complete right bundle branch
block, with a ventricular rate of 210 bpm.</p>

      <p><bold>Chest radiography</bold> showed normal cardiac silhouette and pulmonary
vascular network, and a deformity characterized by a mild bulging located in the
middle of the left ventricular arch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure
1</xref>).</p>
      <p><bold>Ecocardiogram</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>) showed
two homogeneous and echodense images with well-defined round contours. The smallest
was located in the right ventricular free wall and its diameters were 39 x 21 mm,
with an area of 6.9 cm<sup>2</sup>; the largest, in the left ventricular anterior
wall, was 51 x 37 mm, with an area of 12.5 cm<sup>2</sup>. Both masses showed a
cleavage plane with the contiguous ventricular walls and did not cause obstruction
in the ventricular inflow and outflow tracts. Function of both ventricles was
normal.</p>

      </fig>
      <p><bold>Tomography of the thoracic aorta</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure
2</xref>) showed the same pattern, with the larger mass protruding from the left
ventricle, however without causing obstruction to the flow.</p>
      <p><bold>Clinical diagnosis:</bold> Biventricular cardiac tumors without obstruction in
the inflow and outflow tracts, no heart failure, but with repeated paroxysmal
ventricular tachycardia. The tumors were classified as rhabdomyomas because of their
multiple locations, well-defined cleavage plane with the myocardium, and for not
causing obstruction to the flow.</p>
      <p><bold>Clinical reasoning:</bold> The clinical elements were consistent with a normal
cardiovascular system, except for the electrocardiogram and chest radiography, which
showed electrical ischemia of the high lateral wall and protrusion of the
ventricular arch, respectively. These findings suggested the presence of a "mass"
corresponding to the region described, presumably in the pericardium, myocardium or
endocardium. Other imaging tests were decisive to find the ventricular intracavitary
mass which projected itself in the left ventricular anterolateral wall, and was
responsible for the abnormalities described. The other mass found in the free wall
of the right ventricle was smaller and lacked clinical relevance.</p>
      <p><bold>Differential diagnosis:</bold> The abnormal findings observed in the
electrocardiogram and chest radiography could also be present in pericardial
processes such as cysts and tumors, or even in myocardial processes such as fibroma
or other benign tumors.</p>
      <p><bold>Management:</bold> Because of the paroxysmal manifestation of the cardiac
arrhythmia of left ventricular origin, of the right bundle branch block found on the
electrocardiogram during a tachycardia episode, the dose of antiarrhythmic drugs was
increased. If an adequate clinical response is not observed, surgical removal of the
tumor becomes a priority, since the electrophysiological study was unable to
demonstrate possible foci of arrhythmia.</p>
      <p><bold>Comments:</bold> The clinical manifestations of benign tumors of the heart
commonly include heart failure, supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, and
sudden events such as syncope and low cardiac output, whether or not accompanied by
cerebral symptoms. They are usually diagnosed during an episode of infection,
convulsion or fainting. In the present case, chest radiography was the first test to
raise the diagnostic hypothesis of a cardiac tumor because of the bulging observed
in the ventricular arch. The electrical ischemia found in the electrocardiogram may
characterize the exact location of the abnormality, and the diagnostic imaging tests
- echocardiography and MRI, confirmed the diagnosis. Today, arrhythmias in general
may be better treated by means of more appropriate medications, of ablation after
the triggering electrophysiological mechanism has been established, or even of
surgical resection of the tumor mass that is causing the arrhythmia. All are valid
and adequate options. A more conservative approach, with the use of antiarrhythmic
drugs, should be the first option. Over time, other steps may be necessary to
achieve the clinical control of the ventricular arrhythmia.</p>
