      <p>Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease is a systemic syndrome, characterized by sclerosing lesions and usually associated with a raised serum IgG4 level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]; the pancreas, salivary glands, and lacrimal glands are typically affected. Recently, it has been suggested that IgG4-related sclerosing disease represents a subset of cases previously diagnosed as idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This rare inflammatory disorder causes localized or diffused thickening of intracranial dura mater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

      <title>Case report</title>
      <p>A 52-year-old man with a history of treated hypertension and diabetes mellitus presented to our hospital following a single seizure attack; he regained consciousness shortly before arrival. Two weeks before this, he had a head injury that resulted in some minor scalp abrasion and bleeding. No obvious neurological deficit was noted at that time, and he was discharged following a period of observation without imaging. However, on the day after the discharge, he experienced another seizure attack that lasted for 5&#x2013;6&#xA0;minutes with subsequent loss of consciousness. He was then admitted to our hospital.</p>
      <p>Initially, the patient experienced generalized tonic-clonic seizures twice daily. Persistent right calf paresthesia was also noted; this presented as a focal seizure when aggravated and often progressed to a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Under antiepileptic medications, focal seizures remained persistent but progression to secondary generalized seizures became rare.</p>
      <p>On physical examination there were no clinical signs to suggest other organ involvement, in particular there was no glandular enlargement or orbital disease. Abdominal ultrasound showed a normal liver, gallbladder, pancreas and kidneys.</p>
      <p>Magnetic resonance imaging showed thickening of the meninges with enhancement near the superior sagittal sinus; skull bone defect was also noted (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A-D). We initially suspected meningitis or skull metastasis with dura invasion. Subsequently, lumbar puncture was performed for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination. Sugar level was within normal limit compared to peripheral blood sugar levels, and no visible leukocytes were noted. Hemogram did not reveal leukocytosis, and C-reactive protein level was also within the normal limit. Thus, infection seemed unlikely. CSF cytology revealed no malignant cells.</p>

      <p>Left parietal skull and dural nodule excision were then performed for both pathological diagnosis and symptomatic relief (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). Duroplasty was also performed with autologous fascia, and the skull defect was covered with Titanium mesh. Hyperostosis of the skull was noted, and the overlying galea aponeurotica showed thickening and a whitish color change (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). Gliosis was noted along the cortical vessels and gyrus just below the involved dura area (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C).</p>

      <p>Microscopically, sections of the dura and galea showed mixed inflammatory cell infiltration, composed mainly of lymphoplasma cells, in a stroiform fibrous background with occasional eosionphils. Lymphoid follicles with germinal center formations were also observed in the galeal tissue sections (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A-C). Skull sections revealed focal fibrosis and chronic inflammation in the marrow space. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed some inflammatory cells and spindle cells that were immunoreactive to S-100 stain. We concluded that a chronic inflammatory process was occurring, and a diagnosis of idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis was subsequently considered.</p>

      <p>Immunohistochemical analysis using the avidin-biotin-complex (ABC) stain revealed an increased IgG4 (+) plasma cell count, which accounted for more than 50% of the IgG (+) cells with a mean more than 30 in 3 high power fields (HPFs); this was assessed by counting 20 HPFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D &amp; E). No evidence of spirochete infection was observed. Autoimmune profiles were normal, including findings for antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factors. Increased serum IgG4 (939&#xA0;mg/dl; normal ranges: 1&#x2013;140&#xA0;mg/dl) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] was noted. Based on the histopathological and immunohistochemical findings, as well as the exclusion of known causes of pachymeningitis, a diagnosis of IgG4-related hypertrophic intracranial pachymeningitis was made.</p>
      <p>After total excision of the affected skull bone and meninges, the patient&#x2019;s seizures stopped; he was smoothly tapered off antiepileptic medication. In addition, his serum IgG4 levels returned to normal, and no obvious sequela was noted after the operation. Follow-up imaging study and physical examinations in 3&#xA0;months later revealed that the infiltration of the arachnoid membrane had vanished and there was no involvement of other organs.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Hypertrophic pachymeningitis is a rare disorder that causes localized or diffused thickening of the dura mater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Numerous clinico-pathological entities cause thickening of the pachymeninges, thus idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis is diagnosed by exclusion; a dural biopsy is usually essential for a definitive diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Pathological findings consist of thick fibrous dura often associated with chronic inflammation cell infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes and plasma cells; compression of neural structures by the thickened fibrous dura results in neurological defects. Hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis most commonly presents with headache and cranial neuropathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Other associations include seizure, memory loss, ataxia, Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, and pituitary dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The condition has also been described in relation to specific infections, including Lyme disease, syphilis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, fungal infections, cysticercosis, HTLV-1, and malignant external necrotizing otitis due to Pseudomonas. Similarly, it has been described in relation to autoimmune disorders, such as Wegener granulomatosis, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, Beh&#xE7;et disease, Sj&#xF6;gren syndrome, and temporal arteritis. Finally, it can be related to neoplasia, such as carcinomatosis, lymphoma, and meningioma en plaque [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>IgG4-related sclerosing disease was initially recognized as a form of autoimmune pancreatitis. However, it is now known that this disease can affect the bile duct, gallbladder, salivary glands, retroperitoneum, kidneys, lungs, and even, prostate. Pathologically, this disease is characterized by extensive infiltration of IgG4-positive cells in various organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Clinically, it often presents with mass-like lesions. Central nervous system involvement is rarely reported; however, recently it has been suggested that IgG4-related sclerosing disease represents a subset of cases previously diagnosed as idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. IgG4-related sclerosing pachymeningitis may present a diffuse infiltrative pattern with or without mass formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of localized IgG4-related pachymeningitis with concomitant skull hyperostosis. Noda D et al. previously reported a case of idiopathic pachymeningitis with skull hyperostosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] but without clarifying its possible etiology.</p>
      <p>Meningeal biopsies are frequently performed for a differential diagnosis of pachymeningitis, especially for those with infectious etiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In our case, surgical excision was performed to provide possible symptomatic relief as well as for diagnosis. In our case, thickening of the arachnoid membrane was left untouched to avoid parenchymal injury.</p>
      <p>Although it has been reported that pachymeningitis responds well to steroid treatment and other immunosuppressants, we did not prescribe the above medications owing to concerns about the adverse effects of their long-term use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition, this case was found only to be involved locally in dura and skull at admission, and without involvement of other organs, such as: lacrimal glands, salivary glands, or pancreas after detailed examinations.</p>
      <p>The patient&#x2019;s symptoms disappeared following surgical treatment. Thus, surgical excision to decrease the affected region may benefit patients with IgG4-related pachymeningitis, especially for patients with a solitary mass and without other organ involvement. Beyond our expectation, the infiltrative pattern of the involved arachnoid membrane disappeared following surgery. The self-limiting course may be related to the decrease in systemic IgG4 levels. It will be important to follow-up the patient for signs of recurrence and further organ involvement in the future.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Despite its extremely rarity, IgG4-related sclerosing disease may present as a solitary intracranial condition. Surgical biopsy may be the only means of obtaining a differential diagnosis. Extensive excision of the intracranial lesion may be performed for symptomatic patients.</p>
