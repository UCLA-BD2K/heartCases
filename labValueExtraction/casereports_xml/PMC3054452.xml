      <abstract>
        <p>A 32-year-old woman with a long-standing systemic lupus erythematosus had multiple subcutaneous nodules on her axillae, iliac crests and limbs. Three years ago, these nodules began to appear and slowly became larger. Some of them amassed to form a large, fungating, lobulated mass on her right iliac crest. Roentgenographic and histological examination showed that they were calcium deposits. She was initially treated with aluminum hydroxide administration for nine months, which resulted in moderate decrease in size and softening in consistency, but not complete resolution. Then, the mass on the right iliac crest was excised, with an excellent early result.</p>
