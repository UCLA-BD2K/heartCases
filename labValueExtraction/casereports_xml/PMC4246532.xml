      <abstract>
        <p>Considering a fatal case of an aged individual, who died due to falling down stairs,
the cause of the fatal fall was investigated through experiments. A witness, who was with
the victim, when the fatal accident occurred, stated that the aged individual had
miss-footed, lost balance at the top of the stairs, and fell accidently from an upper
floor to a lower floor. It was very questionable whether or not this witness&#x2019;s statements
were true. The true cause of the fatal fall was unclear, because of the witness&#x2019;s
inconsistent statements, which showed discrepancies between the initial and later
statements. The cause of a fatal fall can be presumed from external and internal damages
to the body and other circumstantial evidences. But it was difficult to prove the true
cause of a fatal fall only from the results of the autopsy and investigation of
circumstantial evidences. The author was officially requested to conduct experiments to
elucidate possible falling patterns. Judging from the experimental results, deep questions
about the witness&#x2019;s statements arose. These experimental methods and analyses in this
paper could be applied to elucidate possible falling patterns of fatal falls from stairs
where the fatal causes are controversial.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>According to the mortality statistics classified by the International Classification of
Diseases recommended by the WHO-World Health Organization, 1,917 deaths due to falls on/from
stairs and steps in the United States in 2007<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, 693 deaths in England and Wales in 2011<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, and 679 deaths in Japan in 2012<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many researchers have undertaken demographic or
epidemiological surveys for stair related injuries<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. As far as the author
surveyed past literatures, an experimental article for a fatal fall based on the autopsy
results and detailed configurations of stairs, where a fatal fall occurred, was not found in
past research papers. Most fatal falls from stairs are caused by serious head injuries<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Whenever a fatal stair-accident occurs, the
actual duration time until receiving the first impact by falling down the stairs is within a
second, according to the author&#x2019;s experiments<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because of the instantaneous occurrence
of a stair fall, it is very difficult to find a witness who sees the entire falling patterns
down stairs.</p>
      <p>In the case of no witnesses, the cause of a fatal fall can be sometimes determined from
external injuries on the corpse and circumstantial evidence. Computer simulation can be used
to determine the possible falling patterns, nevertheless, these simulated results are likely
to be largely influenced by initial input parameters, and are not always reliable to
identify the specific decisive causes of actual fatal falls. Taking one fatal case of an
aged individual, who died of severe head injuries, due to a fall down the stairs at a
residential home, the cause of that fatal fall was investigated. Only one witness was with
the victim when the fatal accident occurred. It was questionable whether or not the
witness&#x2019;s comments were true. The fatal fall was examined using a dummy and experimental
stairs with the same configurations, such as the dimensions of the tread rise etc. From the
analyses of the experimental falls by a dummy from stairs, serious questions about the
witness&#x2019;s statements arose.</p>

      <title>Conditions of the Fatal Fall</title>

        <title>Statements by people specifically involved in this investigation</title>
        <p>It was reported that one aged individual fell from the top of the stairs at victim&#x2019;s
home. According to the initial on-site statements of the witness, the aged victim had
accidentally miss-footed, lost balance at the top of the stairs, and fell from an upper to
a lower floor. But strong doubts arose from statements by the rescue crew members. They
found broken debris scattered around the top of the stairs just after arrival at the
victim&#x2019;s home. When they questioned as to what happened, the witness confessed to have had
a quarrel with the victim at the upper floor near the entrance to the stairs. The witness
implied that witness slightly pushed the aged victim just before the occurrence of
fall-incident in witness&#x2019;s first comments. Judging from the suspicious circumstantial
appearances, the rescue crew members speculated that some sort of skirmish had occurred
and about the possibilities of violent action such as shoving the victim near the upper
stairs might have occurred. They reported this information to the regional police office.
Several policemen soon came and questioned the witness on-site. They suspected the
witness&#x2019;s explanation because of inconsistent statements and indications that the aged
victim was shoved at the top of stairs. After retaining attorneys, the suspect stated that
the victim fell down from the top of the stairs accidentally and completely denied the
initial statements that the witness gave external forces to the aged victim, and exercised
one&#x2019;s own constitutional right to remain silent during the public prosecutors&#x2019;
interrogations. The public prosecutors were undermined as to the true cause of the fatal
fall.</p>

        <title>Physical conditions</title>
        <p>Based on a detailed search warrant of the actual stairs, an inspection was conducted by
public inspectors, police officers and the author as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Survey of the actual stairs. (a) View from the upper stairs (b) Incline of the
stairs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="indhealth-52-432-g001"/></fig>. The wooden stairs were 177&#x2005;cm long and 264&#x2005;cm high. The stairs with width of 90&#x2005;cm
consisted of 12 steps with a tread of 16.6&#x2005;cm and a rise of 22.0&#x2005;cm except for the top
step, which had a tread of 23.0&#x2005;cm and a rise of 25.0&#x2005;cm with non-slip vinyl edge of the
step. The incline of stairs was 53 degrees except for the top part of the
stairs which was 47 degrees. A handrail was installed at one side wall of stairs with the
height of around 70&#x2005;cm from the step edge. The heights from the landing of the 1st floor
to the overhang above stairs was 207&#x2005;cm.</p>

        <title>Autopsy of the victim</title>
        <p>The victim died two days after the fall. According to the results of the autopsy, the
occipital area of the head and the top of the left shoulder bones were severely fractured,
and the author illustrated outline drawings from the detailed results of autopsy as shown
in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>External injuries. &#x2460; Severe impact blow marks on the occipital area of the head

head, and bruises at the right backward side of lumber areas were observed. It was
apparent that the victim fell backward from stairs and the occipital area of the head was
strongly impacted on a solid flat surface. The major fatal causes of death were by the
fracture of the skull and intracranial injuries. Several rib bones could have broken while
giving manual resuscitation. But it was inconceivable that ellipse-shaped reddish
congestions in the upper front part of the left breast would be observed, if the victim
fell backwards from the stairs.</p>

        <title>Falling patterns</title>
        <p>According to the author&#x2019;s previous investigations of the actual backward fall experiments
from stairs<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> and by using a dummy on the
level surface<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, it was observed that
the first impact to the back of the head caused the most crucial injury within a second,
as it kept rolling down to the lower floor. In these experiments, the focus was placed on
the head impact blows just after the backward fall. These actual falling patterns were
examined to determine the possible falling patterns to cause such fatal head injuries.
Various possible falling patterns were analyzed in case of a natural fall and intentional
falls. Each falling pattern was recorded by a high speed camera at the rate of 240fps
(Type: Casio EX-FH25). Each of the following three major experiments were conducted
once.</p>
        <p>1. Natural fall assuming an unintentional fall</p>
        <p>- A backward facing dummy was supported in an upright posture at the end of top of
stairs, and was leaned backward at a very slow speed until it fell naturally by itself
without external forces.</p>
        <p>2. Intentional fall assuming a fall from shoving at a standing-still posture</p>
        <p>- A backward facing standing dummy was intensively shoved by an adult at the end of top
of stairs.</p>
        <p>3. Intentional fall assuming a fall from shoving during a stepping-back posture</p>
        <p>- A backward standing dummy on a thin wheeled platform was moved at the speed of
1.6&#x2005;km/h, and was intensively shoved by an adult at the end of top of stairs.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>A dummy and mock-up of the stairs</title>
        <p>To extrapolate the possible falling patterns of the victim from stairs, a dummy, and
model of a head and mock-up stairs with the similar configuration of the actual stairs
were prepared. The dummy&#x2019;s weight was 64&#x2005;kg, and the height was 150&#x2005;cm, approximately the
same weight and dimensional configurations of the victim as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Dummy.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="indhealth-52-432-g003"/></fig>. The major structure of the dummy was steel covered with urethane.
Consequently, each arthro of a dummy was immobilized except for the shoulder joints. The
center of gravity of each limb and the whole body weight were adjusted by the insertion of
lead or iron inside the dummy. A model clay head with the similar dimensional
configurations as the victims was made as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig.
4</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_004" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Model clay head.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="indhealth-52-432-g004"/></fig>. This model clay head was used to search for the impact point determined from
actual steep dimensional configurations of tread and rise prior to conducting the
experiments. Mock-up stairs were made of wooden materials supported by steel scaffoldings
as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_005">Fig. 5</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_005" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>Mock-up of the stairs. (a) View from the anterior side of stairs, (b) View from the

        <title>Analysis of external injuries</title>
        <p>A model clay head with the similar dimensions to the victim&#x2019;s head was utilized to check
the damage points of injuries on the step. Assuming that the first blow impact to the back
of the head occurred on the tread surface or at the step edge, traced marks of external
injuries on the back of the head were observed such as planar injuries at the parietal
area of the head as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_006">Fig. 6a</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_006" position="float"><label>Fig. 6.</label><caption><p>Predicted injuries to the head on the tread and the step edge. (a) Planar injuries

covered with paper coated with pressure sensitive red-dye, was shoved over the step. Red
scars were observed at the parietal area of the head as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_007">Fig. 7</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_007" position="float"><label>Fig. 7.</label><caption><p>Damage observed on the parietal area of the dummy in the case of impact on the

        <p>The dummy&#x2019;s head impacted on the fourth step from the lower landing in case of natural
fall without any external forces as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_008">Fig.

external force toward standing still posture as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_008">Fig. 8b</xref>. The dummy&#x2019;s head impacted on the second step from the
lower landing, in case of shoving a moving dummy at the constant speed of 1.6&#x2005;km/h as
shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_008">Fig. 8c</xref>. According to every result of
experimental falls using a dummy, the dummy hit its head on the step in every experiment.
The aged victim fell backwards and was clear that the occipital area of the head
intensively impacted on the flat surface, such as the lower landing, judging from evidence
of the autopsy, which showed the ellipse-shaped injuries on the occipital area of the
head. Analyzing these results of experiments even in the intentional case of shoving it
with moving backwards, the back of the head of the dummy did not impact on the lower
landing, but on the tread surface.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>From the experiments and autopsy, it was apparent that the fatal victim fell backwards and
struck the occipital area of the victim&#x2019;s head not on the step, but on a flat surface such
as the lower flat landing, and that the victim was shoved from the top of stairs by
intensive external force in the case of the fatal fall initiated around the top of the
stairs. Judging from ellipse-shaped reddish congestions in the upper front part of the left
breast were observed by the results of the autopsy, another criminal scenario can be
considered to give intensive external forces to the victim, while beginning to descend a few
steps below from the top of stairs. These speculations pointed out the fact that the upper
left breast of victim was kicked strongly as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_009">Fig. 9</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_009" position="float"><label>Fig. 9.</label><caption><p>Possible falling patterns from intentional kicks.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="indhealth-52-432-g009"/></fig>. It seems to be difficult to kick strongly on the upper breast on the first and
second step as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_009">Fig. 9a</xref>. The suspect could
kick the victim&#x2019;s upper breast strongly on the left breast by a right foot, presumably when
the victim was standing on the second or third step from the top of stairs as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_009">Fig. 9b</xref> or<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_009">
9c</xref>. The victim would likely fall and impact directly near the lower landing, and
hit the occipital area of victim&#x2019;s head severely as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_010">Fig. 10</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_010" position="float"><label>Fig. 10.</label><caption><p>Possible head impact on the lower landing.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="indhealth-52-432-g010"/></fig>.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Form the experimental results, it is very unnatural that the occipital area of the head of
the fatal victim was strongly impacted on the flat surface like a lower landing without an
external stronger force. The ellipse-shaped reddish contusions on the upper front part of
the left breast were considered to be caused not by drop impacts, but by an intentionally
strong kick. The only witness stated that the victim fell down from the top of the stairs
without any external forces. According to the experimental analyses of actual falls of a
dummy from stairs and observations of fatal head injuries, it is very suspicious that the
victim had accidentally missteps, lost balance at the top of the stairs, and fell from an
upper to a lower floor. These experimental methods and analyses could be applied to
elucidate possible falling patterns of fatal falls from stairs where the fatal causes are
controversial.</p>
