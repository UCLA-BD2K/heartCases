      <abstract>
        <p>Spontaneous ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (sOHSS) is a rare event that may result from a FSH-producing pituitary adenoma (FSHoma), activating mutations of the FSH receptor (FSHR), and cross-reactivity of the FSHR to elevated hCG and TSH in the setting of pregnancy or hypothyroidism. The objective of this study was to investigate whether an aberrant FSHR was present in a woman with sOHSS and a non-surgically diagnosed FSHoma whose serum FSH levels and FSH bioactivity were nearly normal. Sequencing of the patient&#x2019;s <italic>FSHR</italic> gene revealed a heterozygous novel missense mutation c. 1536G&gt;A resulting in an amino acid substitution M512I. We asked whether this mutant FSHR affected FSHR-mediated signaling pathways involving cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA), phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) and v-src sarcoma (Schmidt-Ruppin A-2) viral oncogene homolog kinase (SRC)/ p42/p44 extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2). Thus, 293T cells expressing wild-type (FSHRwt), the mutant FSHR (FSHRmt), or both (FSHRwt/mt) were treated with FSH and subjected to measurements of intracellular cAMP, cAMP-induced CRE (cAMP response element)-mediated luciferase assays and immunoblot analyses of phosphorylated PI3K and ERK1/2. There were no differences in luciferase activities or phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 among FSHRwt, FSHRmt cells and FSHwt/mt cells. However, FSHRmt cells showed a significant reduction in both cAMP production and PI3K phosphorylation levels with unchanged phosphorylation of ERK1/2 upon FSH stimulation in comparison to FSHwt cells. Also, FSH treatment did not provoke PI3K phosphorylation in FSHwt/mt cells. These results indicate that the novel missense M512I FSHR mutation identified herein did not participate in hyperactivation of FSHR-mediated signaling pathways but rather in hypoactivation of the FSH-mediated PI3K/AKT pathway. Thus, this study demonstrates a new functional property of this novel mutatnt FSHR, which, however, might not be involved in the pathogenesis of sOHSS in this FSHoma patient.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is most often an iatrogenic complication of ovulation induction and controlled ovarian hyperstimulation using gonadotropin(s) in infertile patients. Administration of excess recombinant/urinary FSH stimulates the growth of multiple follicles, which results in the hyperproduction of estrogens. The subsequent LH/hCG administration for triggering ovulation is the inciting factor for OHSS. OHSS is characterized by marked ovarian enlargement and increased vessel permeability. It results from the production of bioactive substances such as vascular endothelial growth factor. Moderate to severe OHSS occurs in 0.2% to 2% of all ovarian stimulation cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Severe OHSS is a life-threatening complication accompanied by massive ovarian enlargement, ascites, pleural effusion, oliguria, hemoconcentration, and thromboembolism. Very rarely, patients may manifest signs of OHSS spontaneously during pregnancy or as a result of hypothyroidism, a condition referred to as spontaneous ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (sOHSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Cases of sOHSS together with its possible underlying mechanisms have been reported, and include the cross-reactivity of the FSH receptor (FSHR) to a pregnancy- or hypothyroidism-induced elevation of hCG, in response to TSH in which the specific &#x3B2;-subunits are similar to that of FSH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], activating mutations of the <italic>FSHR</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], or hypergonadotropinemia caused by gonadotropin-producing pituitary adenomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Among these pituitary adenomas, reproductive-aged women with an FSH-producing adenoma (FSHoma) exhibit sOHSS characterized by high serum levels of FSH and estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) together with enlarged multicystic ovaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A plausible explanation is that the excess FSH is the cause of sOHSS; however, we, and others have reported cases of FSHoma-associated sOHSS in which serum FSH levels are nearly normal. In some of these cases E<sub>2</sub> was elevated; though this was not universal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Thus, the mechanism by which an FSHoma induces OHSS is not fully understood. Intriguingly, it has been reported that the FSH produced by an FSHoma possesses enhanced bioactivity, thereby provoking OHSS even when within the normal range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We previously reported a woman with a non-surgically diagnosed FSHoma and sOHSS, whose serum FSH levels were only mildly elevated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We, then assayed the bioactivity of the serum FSH from this patient and found it to be similar to the activity in control women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In the present study we identified a novel missense mutation of the FSHR in the same patient and performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> functional analysis on the mutated FSHR to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) underlying sOHSS caused by this FSHoma.</p>

        <p>Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes of the patient and from the saliva of her mother and two sisters using the DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) and the Oragene DNA Self-Collection kit (DNA Genotek Inc., Ottawa, ON, Canada). All exons of the human <italic>FSHR</italic> gene were sequenced from the patient&#x2019;s genomic DNA. The sequence of the segment harboring the mutation was determined in the product of two independent polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) using genomic DNA extracted from the patient and her family. We employed two in silico algorithms, PolyPhen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and SIFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], to predict the putative impact of missense variant(s) on protein function.

        <p>An expression plasmid encoding the human <italic>FSHR</italic> (h<italic>FSHR</italic>), pcDNA3-h<italic>FSHR</italic> (pc<italic>FSHRwt</italic>), was a generous gift from Dr. Aaron J.W.

A cAMP-responsive element-driven luciferase reporter plasmid p3 x CRE-Luc was constructed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Briefly, three copies of oligonucleotides coding for the canonical cAMP responsive element (CRE) derived from the rat somatostatin gene promoter region were subcloned into a firefly luciferase reporter vector pE1b-Luc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A sea pansy luciferase expression vector pRL-SV40 was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). All plasmids for transfection experiments were prepared using a Genopure Plasmid Maxi Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The identified mutation was introduced into the complementary DNA of pc<italic>FSHRwt</italic> using the QuickChange<sup>TM</sup> Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc. Santa Clara, CA), with synthetic oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation. The primers used for the mutation were as follows; forward primers 5 &#x2018;C ATC AGC AGC TAC ATA AAG GTG AGC ATC TGC3&#x2019; and reverse primer 5&#x2019; G TAG TCG TCG ATG TAT TTC CAC TCG TAG ACG3&#x2019;.

Twenty four hr after transfection, they were treated with or without 100 mIU/mL FSH for 15 min, washed with PBS on the culture dish, and directly collected and lysed in RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM Na <sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na <sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub>). Protein concentrations were determined using a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) with BSA as a standard. Total cell lysates (250 &#xB5;g) obtained from 293T cells transfected with vector alone, pc<italic>FSHRwt</italic>, pc<italic>FSHRmt</italic>, or an equal mixture of pc<italic>FSHRwt</italic> and pc<italic>FSHRmt</italic>, were immunoprecipitated using protein G Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT) human FSHR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; sc-7798). The immunoprecipitates or 20 &#xB5;g of the same total lysates were electrophoresed on 8% or 12% SDS-PAGE for 2 hr at 25 mA and subsequently transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) for 2 hr at 50 V. After blocking nonspecific binding in 5% BSA containing TBS-T for 1 hr, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4&#xB0;C with primary antibodies against the human FSHR, &#x3B2;-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA), total ERK1/2 (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), phospho-PI3K p85 (Tyr458), or total PI3K p85 (Cell Signaling Technology) in TBS-T containing 2% BSA. After washing with TBS-T three times, the membranes were incubated with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000) for 1 hr, and washed three times with TBS-T for 10 min. The immunoreactive proteins were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (GE Healthcare). The intensities of protein bands were quantified with ImageJ&#xAE; software.</p>

        <p>The clinical aspects of this case have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Briefly, the patient, a 40-year old nulligravida woman, presented with enlarged multicystic ovaries which had been detected on transabdominal ultrasonography performed during a health screening visit. She had no complaints except for mild menstrual irregularity, with a cycle length ranging from 20 to 50 days.</p>
        <p>On her initial evaluation, the serum E<sub>2</sub> and prolactin (PRL) concentrations were found to be mildly elevated, ranging as high as 397 pg/mL (normal follicular phase is less than 97) and 24.7 ng/mL (the range for the follicular phase is 2.4 to 18.7), respectively.

After the intravenous administration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), the patient exhibited paradoxical secretory responses of FSH and LH, which collectively led to a presumed diagnosis of an FSH-producing, pituitary microadenoma (FSHoma) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p>
        <p>Since the patient&#x2019;s serum FSH levels were normal to mildly elevated, we postulated that her sOHSS might result not only from increased FSH levels, but also from increased FSH bioactivity. To address this question, we measured the FSH bioactivity of this patient&#x2019;s serum using cAMP-responsive element-driven luciferase assays and granulosa cell aromatase assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. FSH bioactivity, however, did not exceed that of control subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Thus, the OHSS phenotype in this FSHoma patient was not due to altered FSH bioactivity.</p>

        <title>Identification of a novel M512I missense mutation in the FSHR of the sOHSS patient and her family</title>
        <p>The patient presented with sOHSS and a non-surgically diagnosed FSHoma. However, her FSH serum levels were only mildly elevated, and its bioactivity was in the normal range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We, therefore, postulated that aberrant FSHR-mediated signaling pathways might be involved in the pathogenesis of sOHSS in this patient. To address this problem, we first examined the DNA sequence of her <italic>FSHR</italic> gene.</p>
        <p>Sequencing of all exons of the <italic>FSHR</italic> gene derived from genomic DNA revealed that the patient was heterozygous for a G to A transversion (c.1536G&gt;A) that substituted a methionine (Met, M) for isoleucine (Ile, I) at position 512 (p.Met512Ile, M512I) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075478-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), located in the transmembrane region of FSHR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075478-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Met at 512 of FSHR is highly conserved among many species, suggesting essentiality for its structure and function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075478-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). No other nucleotide sequence transversion causing an exchange of an amino acid was found in this case. The in silico algorithm SIFT and PolyPhen was consistent with this mutation being deleterious. Additionally, we searched for known SNPs using the NCBI-dbSNP database and the JSNP database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. No SNPs identical to the 1536G&gt;A mutation were found in either database.

The sequencing of the target region on the <italic>FSHR</italic> gene amplified from the genomic DNA of the patient&#x2019;s mother and two sisters, revealed that the mutation was maternal in origin and that patient&#x2019;s mother and two sisters had the same heterozygous mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075478-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>

        <title>No significant enhancing effect of the mutant FSHR on the FSH/FSHR/cAMP/PKA pathway</title>
        <p>The combination of a missense mutation in the conserved region of the FSHR in this patient with sOHSS, the FSHoma and the result of the in silico analysis led us to postulate that M512I might enable FSHR to hyper-respond to normal or mildly elevated intrinsic FSH. sOHSS then results from hyper-activation of the FSH/FSHR signaling pathway. To address our hypothesis, we prepared wild-type and mutant FSHR expression vectors that were used to transfected 293T cells together with a cAMP-responsive element-driven luciferase reporter plasmid p3 x CRE-Luc. The cells were then subjected to luciferase assays. We first confirmed using an immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence that there were no differences in the expression levels of the FSHR among 293T cells transfected with pc<italic>FSHRwt</italic> (FSHRwt cells), pc<italic>FSHRmt</italic> (FSHRmt cells), or an equal mixture of pc<italic>FSHRwt</italic> and pc<italic>FSHRmt</italic> (FSHRwt/mt cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075478-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>, respectively).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>FSHR belongs to the glycoprotein hormone receptor family, which includes the thyrotropin (TSHR) and lutropin/chorionic gonadotropin (LH/CGR) receptors. These receptors are composed of three distinct domains: 1) a large N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD), 2) a serpentine region containing seven transmembrane segments connected by three extracellular loops and three intracellular loops, and 3) a C-terminal tail that is predicted to be located intracellularly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The presence of seven transmembrane segments indicates that the gonadotropin receptors are members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). The GPCR superfamily is divided into several major subfamilies, and the glycoprotein hormone receptors belong to the rhodopsin receptor&#x2013;like subfamily of GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p>
      <p>The FSHR is expressed in the granulosa cells of the ovary and its activation upon binding of ligands, usually FSH, promotes folliculogenesis. One of the primary and well-characterized signaling cascades results in the activation of adenyl cyclase and the production of the second messenger, cAMP. cAMP, in turn, activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase [protein kinase A (PKA)], leading to the phosphorylation of key substrates, one of which is CREB (cAMP-regulatory element binding protein) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p>

Most of the mutations are located in the serpentine domain of the FHSR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], suggesting the gain of cross-reactivity to other ligands of the glycoprotein hormone family, such as hCG or TSH. These hormones consist of a common &#x3B1;-subunit and specific &#x3B2;-subunits that share more than 40% amino acid sequence homology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The cross-reaction is thought to result from the loss of specificity that lowers the intramolecular barrier to activation rather than an increase in binding affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. As such, the FSHRwt would be unable to respond to the low affinity interaction of hCG or TSH with its ECD. In OHSS mutants, the intramolecular barrier to activation would be lower, thus allowing even poor agonists (such as hCG or TSH) to be effective. The novel M512I FSHR mutation found in the present case was also located in the serpentine domain, suggesting that this mutant FSHR may cross-react with hCG. Contrary to our expectation, however, the <italic>in vitro</italic> functional analysis revealed that the mutant FSHR exhibited no specific responses to hCG at 1 IU/mL. The higher doses of hCG (10 and 50 IU/mL) provoked subtle but significant elevation of CRE-mediated luciferase activities in FSHRwt, FSHRmt and FSHRwt/mt cells. However, FSHRmt cells exhibited less luciferase activation compared to FSHRwt cells following treatment with 50 IU/mL FSH. Thus, mutant FSHR did not behave as an activating mutant. Instead, it might be able to act as an inactivating mutation in the presence of high doses of hCG.</p>
      <p>In addition to this patient, her mother and two sisters had the same heterozygous mutation but had no symptoms of sOHSS. These findings make it unlikely that this mutation is causative for sOHSS. FSHoma is an extremely rare disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], and it is highly unlikely that her mother and two sisters had FSHoma. Given that the mutant FSHR might be preferentially activated in response to only modestly increased FSH levels and/or unknown follicle growth-stimulating factors produced by the FSHoma, it is reasonable that only patients with FSHoma may experience sOHSS. To address this possibility, we examined the activity of this mutated FSHR <italic>in vitro</italic>, in particular, in the presence of the patient&#x2019;s serum. The wild-type and mutant FSHR, however, exhibited very similar cAMP/PKA activation in response to the FSH contained in the patient&#x2019;s serum.</p>
      <p>The series of negative results prompted us to perform molecular analysis of the FSH/FSHR-mediated signaling pathways other than FSH/FSHR/cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway. First, we focused on intracellular cAMP production, one of the most upstream events of FSH/FSHR signaling pathways. We found that cAMP levels were not increased but were in fact decreased in FSHRmt cells when treated with FSH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075478-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This result was contrary to our initial expectation that mutant FSHR might have increased cAMP production and thereby activated its downstream pathway.</p>
      <p>We then investigated the FSH/FSHR/PI3K/AKT pathway and found that mutant FSHR inhibited the phosphorylation of PI3K. It has been reported that cAMP activates PKA, which, in turn, induces the phosphorylation of PI3K through GAP2 inactivation in granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Given that the mutant FSHR did not produce cAMP upon FSH stimulation (as presented herein), it is possible that mutant FSHR did not increase intracellular levels of cAMP and therefore neither activated PKA nor PI3K. Alternatively, there might be a cAMP-independent mechanism because FSHRwt/mt cells exhibited cAMP production but did not display PI3K phosphorylation upon FSH stimulation. Those findings suggest that mutant FSHR might inhibit PI3K activation directly or at least without involvement of cAMP. PI3K is involved in the proliferation, differentiation, survival and enhanced mRNA translation in granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Thus, inhibition of FSH-induced PI3K activation in FSHRmt and FSHRwt/mt cells might contribute to decreased cell proliferation at a specific time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075478-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Elucidation of the precise mechanism awaits further studies.</p>
      <p>The other conflicting result is that CRE-mediated luciferase activity was increased without an elevation of cAMP production upon FSH treatment of FSHwt/mt cells. Genua et al. reported an alternative pathway in which ERK1/2 phosphorylated CREB in a cAMP-independent manner and thereby activated CRE-mediated gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Given the comparable phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in FSHmt cells upon FSH treatment, it is conceivable that the same cAMP-independent ERK1/2-mediated pathway could be activated in FSHwt/mt cells.</p>
      <p>In summary, we obtained novel findings regarding the missense M512I FSHR mutation that is newly identified here. This mutant appears to be inactive in that it inhibited FSH-induced cAMP production and PI3K activation. This finding, however, does not support but rather contradicts our initial hypothesis that the mutant FSHR might be an active mutant and, therefore, might hyper-stimulate ovaries in response to the nearly normal or slightly elevated levels of FSH produced from FSHoma in this patient. Although the mechanism underlying OHSS observed in this patient remains to be clarified, we have for the first time demonstrated the presence of a novel mutation of FSHR together with its new properties as an inactive mutant.</p>
