        <title>SUMMARY</title>
        <p>Dengue is a systemic viral infection that is commonly transmitted between humans via
mosquitoes. Other modes of transmission such as the vertical one are rare and have
been infrequently reported in the literature. This report investigates one case of
vertical transmission of dengue in Guangzhou, China. A G1P1 lady at 39 weeks of
gestation was referred to the Huzhong Hospital presenting a fever for two days. She
subsequently developed a skin rash on the back and lower limb and at that time she
had already experienced five days of fever. She subsequently went into labor and
delivered a female neonate weighting 3,500 g at birth. The neonate developed fever on
the third day of life which was associated with a systemic erythematous skin rash.
There was no report or evidence of mosquito bites after birth. A complete blood count
showed leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia and the liver function test showed
elevated AST, GGT and bilirubin. Dengue was diagnosed in the mother and the neonate
by the ELISA dengue virus NS1 antigen test (Wantai, Beijing, China) and dengue virus
fluorogenic quantitative PCR test (Liferiver, Shanghai, China).The case report
illustrates the possibility of the vertical transmission of dengue. Clinicians should
be alert to this possibility and institute early treatment. Further direct evidence
and research are required. </p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Dengue is a self-limiting systemic viral infection transmitted between humans via
mosquitoes. Previously, dengue was stratified by disease severity into dengue fever,
dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. However, recently, the
classification has been revised and simplified, resulting in the terms dengue or severe
dengue<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. Dengue is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an acute febrile
illness associated with two or more of the following signs or symptoms: intense
headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, skin rash, leucopenia and hemorrhagic
manifestations<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>. In recent years, dengue has proven to be an increasingly serious global health
challenge as the incidence of dengue has been rising with concomitant expansion of the
endemic regions. The WHO estimates that about 2.5 billion people worldwide are at risk
of dengue infection, with 50 to 100 million new cases annually, of which 500 thousand
severe patients are treated as outpatients and about 25 thousand patients die<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>. </p>
      <p>In China, dengue cases are mainly centered in the Guangdong province, which has ever
since developed local public health efforts to control dengue. In past years, there have
been major outbreaks of dengue in Guangdong in 1995, 2002, 2006 and 2013, accounting for
a major outbreak every 4-7 years. The latest outbreak has taken place in 2014, and at
that time a total of 45,189 dengue cases were reported, with six deaths. In terms of
epidemiology, although the four serotypes of dengue virus have already been reported in
China, dengue virus type 1 is responsible for the majority of cases<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>.</p>
      <p>Dengue during pregnancy may be associated with various maternal and neonatal
complications. Regarding the maternal complications, the most severe form of dengue
during pregnancy can lead to death. Other complications include perinatal death,
miscarriage, low birth weight, preterm delivery and subsequent admission to the neonatal
intensive care unit<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. Until now, all the reported cases of congenital dengue virus infection have
occurred in neonates whose mothers were infected very late in pregnancy. Several studies
indicate that intrauterine infection caused by dengue viruses can be proved by the virus
isolation from fetal or cord blood samples<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>. Due to the fact that cases of vertical transmission of dengue have been
infrequently reported globally <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 25 year-old Chinese pregnant woman at 39 weeks of gestation was admitted to a general
hospital complaining of fever (initial T<sub>max</sub> 37.8 <sup>0</sup>C) that rose to
39.2 <sup>0</sup>C and was associated with a mild erythematous skin rash. After
admission, the patient progressed with arthralgia, myalgia, frontal headache, but
without nausea or vomiting. A complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of
5,560 /mm<sup>3</sup> (83.8% of neutrophils), C - reactive protein of 9.3 mg/L,
procalcitonin of 0.14 ng/mL. On the second day of hospitalization, rupture of membranes
was noticed and she underwent a cesarean delivery. Postoperatively, the fever persisted
and was not relieved by the use of ibuprofen. She subsequently developed a skin rash on
her back and lower limbs on the third day after the cesarean delivery, and this was not
relieved by the use of a calcium gluconate injection as an anti-anaphylactic treatment.
The patient was thereafter transferred to the Zhujiang Hospital, a reference center, in
the 5<sup>th</sup> of October 2014. On admission she was afebrile with a heart rate of
84 bpm, a blood pressure of 88/66 mmHg and the respiratory rate was 18 with clear lungs
on auscultation. The abdomen was soft, with mild epigastric tenderness. Neurological
examination including the eye fundus was normal. There was no evidence of bleeding on
the clinical evaluation. The complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of
3,230 /mm<sup>3</sup> (neutrophils 58.9%), while the platelet count, hemoglobin, IL-6
and procalcitonin were 88,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, 11.8 g/dL, 11.8 ng/L and 0.1 ng/mL,
respectively. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate, prothrombrin time, urine analysis,
serum creatinine, hepatic transaminases were all within normal limits and remained
normal during the entire hospital stay. No focal lesions were observed on the chest
X-ray. A clinical diagnosis of a viral fever or dengue was made based on the history and
the physical examination. On the day of admission corresponding to the eighth day of
fever, dengue virus infection was confirmed by the finding of a positive dengue virus
NS1 antigen by ELISA and a seroconversion demonstrated by the presence of IgM and IgG
anti-dengue virus. The dengue virus was serotype 1. All the blood samples were processed
and tested in the Zhujiang Hospital Central Laboratory. The patient was treated
according to the current national dengue management guidelines that preconizes fluid
balance as well as the monitoring of blood pressure, blood parameters and bleeding. The
white cell and platelet counts were checked every day. The fever disappeared after
admission, the white cell has rapidly increased from 3,230/mm<sup>3</sup> on day 1 to
10,7000/mm<sup>3</sup> on day 2. The platelet count has also returned to normal. On
day 3 she was discharged from hospital afebrile and clinically well, presenting normal
white cell and platelet counts.</p>
      <p>The neonate was female, weighting 3,500 g at birth, with an Apgar score of 9 at the
5<sup>th</sup> minute of life, and she appeared well at birth. The neonate has never
left the maternity ward since birth, and had no history of mosquito bites after birth.
She developed fever on day 3 after birth (T<sub>max.</sub> 38.5 &#xB0;C), a systemic
erythematous skin rash on day 1 of fever, and the complete blood count revealed a white
blood cell count of 8,420 /mm<sup>3</sup> with 60.9% of neutrophils. She was admitted to
the neonatal intensive care unit of the Zhujiang Hospital on day 2 of fever. The
complete blood count was checked every two days. Her hemoglobin decreased notably
reaching the lowest value of 13.4 g/L, platelet count of 29,000/mm<sup>3</sup> and white
blood cell count of 1,308/mm<sup>3</sup> (37.0% of neutrophils). The complete blood
count variation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>. Her liver
function tests showed mildly elevated AST, a four-fold elevated &#x1D6C4;GT and an
eight-fold elevated bilirubin, meanwhile her ALT was normal. Two days later, new liver
function tests showed normal ALT, two-fold elevated AST, four-fold elevated &#x1D6C4;GT
and six-fold elevated bilirubin. The chest X-ray showed increased bronchovascular
markings. The prothrombin time, urinalysis and serum creatinine were all within normal
limits and remained normal during the entire hospital stay. On the third day of life,
one blood sample of the neonate was collected and then dengue was confirmed through a
positive dengue virus NS1 antigen test (ELISA). A seroconversion has not been confirmed
due to absence of anti-IgM and IgG to dengue virus. On the fifth day of fever
(8<sup>th</sup> day of life) another blood sample was collected and a positive dengue
virus fluorogenic quantitative PCR result was reported. Serotype of Dengue virus
serotype 1 was found. All of the samples were processed and tested in the Zhujiang
Hospital Central Laboratory. During the hospital stay, the neonate had no clinical
manifestations of intracranial hemorrhage and her blood pressure was normal. The neonate
was finally diagnosed with dengue, neonatal jaundice, neonatal pneumonia and an atrial
septal defect. It is not clear whether neonatal jaundice and neonatal pneumonia are
related to dengue. It is unlikely that the atrial septal defect is related to the dengue
infection. She was treated according to the current national dengue management
guidelines and was afebrile by day 3 of fever when her skin rash began to disappear. Her
treatment involved gamma globulin transfusion, plasma transfusion, anti-inflammatory and
antipyretic drugs. When she was discharged from hospital, the neonate's clinical
condition was fine but her body weight had fallen to 3,350 g. The neonate was followed
up and her basic developmental milestones (weight, height, fine motor and language) were
normal at the age of one. However, cranial ultrasounds to evaluate the occurrence of
intracranial hemorrhages were not performed.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Several cases of vertical transmission of dengue showing the presence of dengue virus in
fetal and cord blood samples have been reported worldwide, demonstrating the
intrauterine acquisition of dengue infection<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>. However, vertical transmission is not considered a common mode of transmission
of dengue infection<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. Furthermore, the likelihood of vertical transmission when the mother is
infected is low. To date, there have been no reports of congenital dengue infection in
neonates born to mothers infected early in pregnancy. A possible explanation is that
maternal infections acquired near the time of delivery would not have had enough time
for protective antibodies to be produced and transferred to the neonate, therefore
conferring a passive immunity. The maternal viremia would therefore be transferred to
the unprotected fetus<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>. Some reports have described variable neonatal outcomes, from asymptomatic
infections to death. </p>
      <p>Laboratory diagnosis is vital for dengue infections confirmation. Laboratory diagnosis
can be performed through dengue virus isolation, dengue virus nucleic acid detection,
NS1 antigen detection and the use of other serological methods. Samples for dengue virus
detection must be taken within the first four to five days of infection, during the
febrile phase. The NS1 antigen detection appears to peak about seven days after the
onset of symptoms. IgM levels rise quickly and appear to be detectable from 3-5 days and
then peak about two weeks after the onset of symptoms, then declining to undetectable
levels over 2-3 months. IgG appears shortly after IgM though with very low levels at the
beginning. Primary dengue infections are characterized by high levels of anti-dengue IgM
and low levels of IgG<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>. In this case, the diagnosis of dengue in the mother was confirmed by the dengue
virus NS1 antigen test (ELISA) and the diagnosis in the neonate was confirmed by both,
the dengue virus NS1 antigen (ELISA) and the dengue virus fluorogenic quantitative PCR.
Although we did not collect the neonate's cord blood samples which could act as a direct
evidence of vertical transmission, the clinical manifestation and laboratory test
results combined with the lack of antecedents of mosquito bites after birth gave us
sufficient ground to formulate the suspicion of congenital, vertically transmitted
dengue infection which has manifested in the neonatal period. </p>
      <p>The case correlates well with other reported cases in the literature. Firstly, all
reported cases of congenital dengue infections have occurred in neonates born to mothers
infected very late in pregnancy. In this case, the mother developed fever at 39 weeks of
gestation, and subsequently underwent a cesarean delivery. Furthermore, the latent
period of dengue is between 3-15 days, more commonly between 5-8 days. In this sense,
the earliest possible presentation of a primarily acquired neonatal dengue infection
would have been on day four of the infants' life. In the review by <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Sirinavin (2004</xref>), the onset of fever in cases of vertically
transmitted dengue virus infections varied from one to 11 days after birth, with an
average of four days and the signs and symptoms lasted 1-5 days<sup>23</sup>. In the
present case report the neonate developed fever on day three of life, accompanied by a
systemic erythematous skin rash that lasted for three days. Thus, it is highly unlikely
that the neonate has acquired the infection via vectors and a vertical transmission is
much more likely. Furthermore, almost all of the confirmed cases were reported during
outbreaks in highly endemic areas such as Cuba, Brazil, Malaysia, and Thailand<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref>. The reason for this behavior is not clear, but maybe the outbreaks increase the
likelihood of pregnant women to be infected. According to data released by the Guangdong
Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2014, the Guangdong province
experienced a major outbreak of dengue with a total of 45,189 cases. Taking this
information into account, the epidemiology of the present case is consistent with past
results. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, vertical transmission may be a probable mode of dengue infection. If a
woman acquires dengue during pregnancy, clinicians should consider the possibility of
vertical transmission, treat the mother and monitor the possible vertical transmission.
During late pregnancy, women can also consider the use of preventing measures such as
more vigilance to avoid mosquito bites when they live in endemic areas so as to lower
the risk of infection. Further direct evidence and research is required.</p>
