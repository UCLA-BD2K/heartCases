      <abstract>
        <p>Genetic leukoencephalopathies (gLEs) are a group of heterogeneous disorders with white matter abnormalities affecting the central nervous system (CNS). The causative mutation in ~50% of gLEs is unknown. Using whole exome sequencing (WES), we identified homozygosity for a missense variant, <italic>VPS11</italic>: c.2536T&gt;G (p.C846G), as the genetic cause of a leukoencephalopathy syndrome in five individuals from three unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) families. All five patients exhibited highly concordant disease progression characterized by infantile onset leukoencephalopathy with brain white matter abnormalities, severe motor impairment, cortical blindness, intellectual disability, and seizures. The carrier frequency of the <italic>VPS11</italic>: c.2536T&gt;G variant is 1:250 in the AJ population (n = 2,026). VPS11 protein is a core component of HOPS (homotypic fusion and protein sorting) and CORVET (class C core vacuole/endosome tethering) protein complexes involved in membrane trafficking and fusion of the lysosomes and endosomes. The cysteine 846 resides in an evolutionarily conserved cysteine-rich RING-H2 domain in carboxyl terminal regions of VPS11 proteins. Our data shows that the C846G mutation causes aberrant ubiquitination and accelerated turnover of VPS11 protein as well as compromised VPS11-VPS18 complex assembly, suggesting a loss of function in the mutant protein. Reduced <italic>VPS11</italic> expression leads to an impaired autophagic activity in human cells. Importantly, zebrafish harboring a <italic>vps11</italic> mutation with truncated RING-H2 domain demonstrated a significant reduction in CNS myelination following extensive neuronal death in the hindbrain and midbrain. Thus, our study reveals a defect in <italic>VPS11</italic> as the underlying etiology for an autosomal recessive leukoencephalopathy disorder associated with a dysfunctional autophagy-lysosome trafficking pathway.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Genetic leukoencephalopathies (gLEs) are a group of heterogeneous disorders with white matter abnormalities in the central nervous system (CNS). Patients affected with gLEs have brain white matter defects that can be seen on MRI and exhibit variable neurologic phenotypes including motor impairment, hypotonia, pyramidal dysfunction, dystonia and/or dyskinesias, ataxia, seizures, cortical blindness, optic atrophy, and impaired cognitive development. The exact etiology of half of gLEs is unknown. We studied three unrelated families affected with an undiagnosed gLE and discovered a homozygous germline mutation c.2536T&gt;G in <italic>VPS11</italic>, a gene involved in membrane trafficking and fusion of lysosomes and endosomes, as a novel cause of a new gLE syndrome. The mutation in <italic>VPS11</italic> results in protein instability and impaired protein complex assembly. In addition, we show that <italic>VPS11</italic> is required for proper autophagic activities in human cells. Importantly, we characterized a zebrafish line carrying a <italic>vps11</italic> mutation and confirmed its essential role in brain white matter development and neuron survival.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Genetic leukoencephalopathies (gLEs) are a group of heterogeneous disorders with white matter abnormality in the central nervous system (CNS) [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Patients affected with gLEs manifest variable neurologic phenotypes including motor impairment, hypotonia, pyramidal dysfunction, dystonia and/or dyskinesias, ataxia, seizures, cortical blindness, optic atrophy, and impaired cognitive development [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Currently, there are over 90 gLEs with primary or secondary white matter abnormalities which are inherited in dominant, recessive or X-linked forms [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The genetic factors implicated in gLEs thus far suggest impaired activity in lysosomes, peroxisomes, mitochondria and intermediary metabolism [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, much of the disease mechanism remains elusive and in at least half of individuals with a white matter disorder, the genetic etiology is unknown [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this work, we sought to identify the genetic defects in five patients from three unrelated families affected with a previously unrecognized leukoencephalopathy disorder. Using whole exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous missense variant <italic>VPS11</italic>: c.2536T&gt;G (p.C846G) in all five patients. Previous studies in yeast identified and characterized Vps (vacuolar protein sorting) proteins as key regulators of cargo delivery to vacuoles [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Severe growth, trafficking and organelle morphology defects were observed when Vps Class C proteins were mutated [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], Vps-C core components were found in CORVET and HOPS protein complexes involved in membrane trafficking and autophagy, respectively [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Autophagy is a major catabolic cellular process for the degradation of proteins and organelles upon nutrients starvation. Impaired autophagy contributes to pathological conditions in multiple organs or tissues including neurodegeneration [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A combination of clinical evaluation, genetic analysis, biochemical and cellular assays, and an animal model study in this report demonstrates that the amino acid substitution, C846G, results in a loss of VPS11 function, and that VPS11 deficiency contributes to autophagy impairment, myelination defects and neurodegeneration underlying the pathogenesis of a novel gLE syndrome.</p>

        <title>Clinical Characterization</title>
        <p>Patient A from Family I was born at full-term to non-consanguineous parents of Ashkenazi Jewish descent following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. She came to medical attention at seven months of age for evaluation of delayed milestones. A clinical exam at that time revealed developmental delay and hypotonia, prompting a brain MRI which showed prominent lateral ventricles with scalloped borders secondary to decreased periventricular white matter volume and a diminutive corpus callosum. By two years of age, she had developed tonic-clonic seizures and was cortically blind and hearing impaired. At her most recent follow-up at eleven years of age, she was severely developmentally delayed, non-verbal, and non-ambulatory. She was primarily G-tube fed due to risk of aspiration and had a neurogenic bladder. Physical examination was remarkable for microcephaly (&lt;2<sup>nd</sup> percentile), non-dysmorphic facial features, diffuse hypotonia, joint contractures, and no hepatosplenomegaly. Comprehensive metabolic screening and genetic testing for chromosomal aneuploidy, Rett syndrome, and Fragile X were all normal. A younger sister (patient A-S1) was noted to have developmental delay at four months of age. An MRI at five months showed minimal myelination in the deep cerebellar white matter and a greatly diminished corpus callosum. A brother (patient A-S2) began displaying similar symptoms at two to three months old and had an MRI that was significant for white matter abnormalities. Both of siblings presented essentially the same phenotype at older ages as the proband.</p>
        <p>Patient B from Family II was born at full-term to a non-consanguineous couple of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. He was noted by his parents to have delayed milestones at five months of age. At most recent follow-up at five years of age, he was globally delayed, non-ambulatory and non-verbal, with cortical visual impairment and a history of febrile seizures. A swallow evaluation had demonstrated aspiration. Physical exam was notable for microcephaly (&lt;2<sup>nd</sup> percentile) and low weight (&lt;5<sup>th</sup> percentile), profound central hypotonia, mild lower leg hypertonia, joint contractures, dystonic posturing of the hands, and no hepatosplenomegaly. Brain MRI performed at nine months and five years of age showed multifocal T2/FLAIR hyperintense signal abnormalities of the supratentorial white matter extending from the periventricular regions into the juxtacortical regions, involving all lobes but most pronounced within the bilateral parieto-occipital regions. Diminished white matter volume with a hypoplastic corpus callosum was also noted. Relative to the nine month scan, the five year scan demonstrated a mild increase in myelination, however, a fairly extensive region of abnormal white matter including a diminutive corpus callosum was still evident on the five year scan consistent with a delayed myelination syndrome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005848.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005848.t001">Table 1</xref>). Comprehensive metabolic screening and genetic testing including an Ashkenazi Jewish disease panel, dedicated mitochondrial gene microarray, karyotype, and chromosomal microarray were normal.</p>

        <p>Patient C from Family III was born at full-term to non-consanguineous parents of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. Pregnancy was notable for an elevated alpha-fetoprotein measurement on maternal serum screening; prenatal ultrasound and amniocentesis were reportedly normal. He was born by Cesarean section for failure of labor to progress. He was noted by his parents to have strabismus and developmental delay as an infant. MRI at age 11 months showed periventricular white matter abnormalities in the occipital and frontal regions suggesting a myelination defect. At last follow-up at 19-years of age, he had profound intellectual disability, a history of static optic atrophy, mild to moderate hearing loss, oropharyngeal and GI dysmotility, and central dysautonomia characterized by sensitivity to temperature and mottling of the extremities. He was non-dysmorphic on exam and had low body weight (3rd-10th percentile), central hypotonia with spastic quadriplegia, and no hepatosplenomegaly. Prior extensive work-up to evaluate for an underlying mitochondrial disorder, including mitochondrial DNA analysis, had been non-diagnostic.</p>
        <p>In summary, these five patients from three unrelated families of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry exhibit highly concordant neurologic symptoms including severe developmental delay, seizures, hypotonia, cortical visual impairment or optic atrophy, absence of hepatosplenomegaly, and white matter abnormalities suggesting leukoencephalopathy. In addition, signs of autonomic dysfunction including oromotor dysfunction, body temperature instability, neurogenic bladder, and constipation were present in several of these patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005848.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>WES Analyses</title>
        <p>A total of 139,049 variants were identified by WES among the familial sextet in this index family (Family I) including the parents, two affected (patient A and A-S1) and two unaffected children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005848.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). After general filtering to exclude common (MAF&gt;1%) and benign variants, a genetic filter assuming a recessive disease transmission mode in this family was applied. One homozygous variant <italic>VPS11</italic>:c.2536T&gt;G (p.C846G) and two compound heterozygous variants <italic>RGS22</italic>:c.3007G&gt;A (p.G1003R) and c.786C&gt;A (p.N262K) co-segregated with the disease phenotype. Sanger sequencing revealed that the homozygous <italic>VPS11</italic>:c.2536T&gt;G variant was also present in the third affected child (patient A-S2) who was not included in the WES analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005848.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In addition, this affected child carried two copies of the <italic>RGS22</italic> WT allele; therefore, <italic>RGS22</italic> variants were ruled out as causative for the familial disorder. The <italic>VPS11</italic>:c.2536T&gt;G variant is in exon 15 of the <italic>VPS11</italic> gene and results in a p.C846G missense change. The population frequency of this variant has not been reported in 1000 Genomes Database or the NHBLI Exome Sequencing Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/">http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/</ext-link>). In the ExAC database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://exac.broadinstitute.org/">http://exac.broadinstitute.org/</ext-link>), this variant has a very low minor allele frequency (0.00016 in non-Finnish Europeans, n = 67,740), and is not present in a homozygous state. The cysteine at position 846 of VPS11 is localized within a cysteine-rich RING-H2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005848.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). The p.C846G change is predicted to be deleterious/damaging by SIFT, PolyPhen-2, GERP++, MutationTaster, and Mutation Assessor by in silico analyses. In an independent study, patient B and C were analyzed by WES using a different methodology [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] which did not yield any positive findings in known gLE genes. However, these two patients were found to carry the same homozygous variant <italic>VPS11</italic>:c.2536T&gt;G identified in the index family.</p>

        <title>Carrier Frequency Analysis</title>
        <p>Since all five patients have AJ ancestry, we were prompted to study the mutation frequency in this population. To this end, we carried out a Taqman assay using anonymized gDNAs from 2,026 healthy AJ individuals. Nine individuals were found to be heterozygous for this variant with no homozygotes identified, resulting in an allele frequency of 0.22% or 1:250 carrier frequency in this population. To examine whether the presence of the variant in this population is due to a founder effect, we searched runs of homozygosity containing the <italic>VPS11</italic>:c.2536T&gt;G variant using the WES data sets from the index family. Next we genotyped five SNP markers (rs13929, rs470679, rs12795576, rs1135258 and rs10892350) in these three families and confirmed a minimum of 299 kb shared haplotype block (chr11:118915755&#x2013;119215256) containing the <italic>VPS11</italic>:c.2536T&gt;G variant in these families. All affected children were homozygous and the parent or sibling carriers were heterozygous for these SNPs. This finding supports that the <italic>VPS11</italic>:c.2536T&gt;G variant represents a founder mutation in the AJ population.</p>

        <title>Functional Characterization of the <italic>VPS11</italic> Mutation</title>
        <p>To determine the effect of the mutation on the VPS11 protein, we transiently expressed the FLAG-tagged wild-type (WT) VPS11 or C846G mutant in HeLa cells. Despite the same amount of transfected plasmid DNA, VPS11 protein harboring the C846G mutation had a remarkably reduced expression level compared to the WT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005848.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). To evaluate protein stability, we performed a cycloheximide chase assay in transfected cells. The half-life of the WT protein was five-fold higher than that of the C846G mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005848.g003">Fig 3B&#x2013;3D</xref>). Homology modeling of VPS11-RING-H2 domain shows that the C846 residue is localized within the &#x3B1;-helix of this region that could be disturbed by the C846G mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005848.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). We purified Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) tagged fusion polypeptides corresponding to the RING-H2 domain of the WT and C846G variant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005848.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) and performed circular dichroism (CD) assay. Both WT and C846G RING-H2 domain fragments showed a typical curve for RING-H2 domain proteins with negative peaks at 206 nm and 225 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005848.g003">Fig 3F</xref>), suggesting that C846G does not disrupt the overall folding or secondary structure of the RING-H2 domain <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thus the instability of the C846G variant is unlikely due to improper folding of the RING-H2 domain. To determine the cause of the mutant protein&#x2019;s instability <italic>in cellulo</italic>, we investigated the ubiquitination state of VPS11. We immunoprecipitated FLAG tagged VPS11 WT and C846G mutant and detected their ubiquitination levels using an anti-ubiquitin antibody. A significant increase in the levels of ubiquitination was observed in the mutant protein compared to the WT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005848.g003">Fig 3G and 3H</xref>). Given that RING-H2 domain containing proteins are known to possess E3-ubiquitin ligase activity [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], we examined the global ubiquitination level in above conditions and found no significant difference in the basal level of total ubiquitinated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005848.g003">Fig 3G and 3I</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the increased ubiquitination of C846G mutant might result in accelerated degradation of VPS11.</p>

Therefore, we investigated whether the C-terminus residing C846G variation affected VPS11-VPS18 interaction. Following the immunoprecipitation of the FLAG-tagged WT and C846G proteins, we found that the C846G mutation significantly decreased the interaction between VPS11 and the endogenous VPS18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005848.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>) suggesting that the C846G variant reduced the Vps-C core assembly.</p>

        <p>As a component of HOPS complex important for endo-lysosomal trafficking, VPS11 has been implicated in the regulation of autophagy in the lower eukaryotic organisms [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Given that C846G mutant displays protein instability and reduced complex formation with VPS18, we reason that C846G is a loss of function mutation. Thus we performed siRNA knockdown to investigate the consequence of reduced <italic>VPS11</italic> expression on autophagy in human cells. We found that knockdown of VPS11 caused accumulation of the autophagy markers, p62 and LC3 in basal condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005848.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>). Induction of autophagy through mTOR inhibitor Torin [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] promoted clearance of these markers in control cells (siCtrl) and had little effect in VPS11 depleted cells. No further increase of these markers was detected in si<italic>VPS11</italic> transfected cells treated with Bafalomycin A1 (autophagy flux inhibitor), suggesting that depletion of VPS11 does not affect a biosynthetic step, but rather diminishes the autophagy flux. Therefore, we performed autophagy flux assay using tandem fluorescent protein fusion RFP-GFP-LC3 reporter to evaluate the impact of VPS11 depletion on fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the reporter plasmid transfected cells we observed significant accumulation of immature autophagosomes (red and green fluorescence merge, resulting in yellow) and reduced amount of autolysosomes (red only due to quench of green fluorescence in acidic vacuoles) in VPS11-depleted cells compared to control cells upon autophagy induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005848.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>). Altogether, the data demonstrate that reduced expression of VPS11 impaired autophagy flux in human cells and indicate that C846G is a loss-of-function mutation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our extended WES analysis on a familial sextet and two additional unrelated AJ families has linked a single variant <italic>VPS11</italic>: c.2536T&gt;G (p.C846G) to a new autosomal recessive leukoencephalopathy syndrome with brain myelination defects, severe motor skill deficits, cortical blindness or optic atrophy, intellectual disability, and seizures. We show that the cysteine to glycine change, which occurs at an evolutionarily conserved cysteine rich RING-H2 domain in the C-terminus of VPS11, decreases its protein stability and enhances its ubiquitination levels, which are likely associated with accelerated protein turnover. Our study also demonstrates that VPS11 deficiency resulted in impairment of autophagy flux in human cells, which is in agreement with the results from the yeast and zebrafish studies [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, zebrafish harboring a <italic>vps11</italic> mutation with abolished RING-H2 domain exhibits reduced myelination and significant neuronal death, confirming an essential role for VPS11 in CNS development and substantiates the causality of the C846G mutation in leukoencephalopathy. Our study establishes that defects in <italic>VPS11</italic> are a novel cause of leukoencephalopathy, and identifies the C846G as an AJ founder mutation, thus providing valuable knowledge for genetic counseling in the affected families and in predicting disease risk. The diagnosis for VPS11 related leukoencephalopathy solely based on clinical exam or brain imaging can be challenging, but it should be suspected in a patient of Ashkenazi Jewish descent with infantile-onset leukoencephalopathy associated with severe developmental delay, visual impairment and seizures. The lack of a distinctive clinical phenotype is a common barrier to diagnosis in patients with leukoencephalopathy [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and underscores the need for comprehensive approaches to genetic testing (eg. panel-based testing, whole exome sequencing, or whole genome sequencing) in affected patients with nonspecific phenotypes [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These broad-based approaches also enable recognition of unanticipated phenotypic expansion and facilitate identification of novel disease genes.</p>
      <p>VPS11 plays an important role in membrane trafficking and fusion of the lysosomes and endosomes by forming conserved protein complexes with a number of additional VPS proteins [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our study found that the VPS11-C846G is less stable than the WT protein. However, the altered stability does not appear to involve the misfolding of RING-H2 domain, but instead could be due to the increased ubiquitination of the VPS11 protein. Interestingly, RING domains usually exhibit an E3-ubiquitin ligase activity, which enables the protein to regulate its stability by inducing autoubiquitination [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus, future experiments should investigate the detailed mechanism by which C846G mutation enhances the ubiquitination of VPS11. Moreover, thorough investigation is required to determine whether proteasomal or lysosomal degradation is responsible for the turnover of VPS11 and how C846G variant affects the turnover in disease relevant cell types. Understanding the mechanism of increased ubiquitination is also crucial since E3-ligases represent potential therapeutic targets to modulate the ubiquitin-proteasome system activity, which may allow future treatment to regulate the proteome homeostasis. [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Finally, we found that the C846G mutation also significantly decreased the interaction between VPS11 and the endogenous VPS18 suggesting that the C846G mutation may affect the Vps-C core assembly.</p>
      <p>Our study raises a question whether autophagic defects contribute to myelination defects as observed in the patients described in this study. Autophagy is known for the regulation of lipid metabolism and may have a role in myelination [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Knockdown of Vps16 (another component in Vps Class C) in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> drastically reduced normal fat storage [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The observation highlights the importance of Vps-C complexes (HOPS and CORVET) in the regulation of lipid metabolism, an important process for myelination [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. On the other hand, autophagy defects are associated with neurological disorders including early onset neurodegenerative disease [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, it is also possible that the myelination defects seen in our patients could be secondary to dysfunctional neurons as neuronal activity is essential for proper myelination <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A variety of leukoencephalopathies are neurodegenerative diseases with a prominent secondary white matter involvement such as GM1 gangliosidosis and neuronal ceroid lipofucinosis [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is worth mentioning that in addition to motor symptoms commonly seen in primary leukodystrophies, microcephaly, severe cognitive impairments and seizures are present in our patients suggesting a primary neuronal/axonal defect in this disease. Interestingly, the zebrafish <italic>vps11</italic> mutant mode displays increased neuronal death in the midbrain and hindbrain. Notably, the neuronal death was observed at 3 and 5 dpf, which preceded the significant reduction in myelination observed at 7 dpf. Therefore, it is unlikely that the neuronal loss is due to myelination defects as seen in Pelizaeus&#x2013;Merzbacher disease [<xref rid="pgen.1005848.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], but primary neuronal dysfunction and secondary deficit in myelination may explain the pathophysiology of this disease. Future experiments should also investigate neuronal or oligodendritic contribution to defective myelination or neuronal death using cell type specific deletion of the <italic>VPS11</italic> gene in mammals.</p>
      <p>In summary, our study identifies a homozygous mutation in <italic>VPS11</italic> as causative in a novel leukoencephalopathy disorder associated with dysfunctional autophagy-lysosome trafficking pathway, and implicates VPS11 as a potential therapeutic drug target for this devastating infantile disease.</p>

Each scan was performed two times for signal averaging. The CD signal was converted to mean residue molar ellipticity and the results from the three protein concentrations were averaged. Buffer for all CD experiments consisted of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% reduced Triton-X-100 and 1 mM dithiothreitol.</p>

          <p>The method uses NIH image J to measure the intensity of the signal in a given area. It measures the intensity of an area with no signal and subtracts this out as background. That gives the final value in an arbitrary unit of fluorescent intensity.
