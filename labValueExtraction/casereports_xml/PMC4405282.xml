        <p>In a glioblastoma tumour with multi-region sequencing before and after recurrence, we find an IDH1 mutation that is clonal in the primary but lost at recurrence. We also describe the evolution of a double-minute chromosome encoding regulators of the PI3K signalling axis that dominates at recurrence, emphasizing the challenges of an evolving and dynamic oncogenic landscape for precision medicine.</p>

          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain cancer occurring in adults, and is associated with dismal outcome and few therapeutic options. GBM has been shown to predominantly disrupt three core pathways through somatic aberrations, rendering it ideal for precision medicine approaches.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>We describe a 35-year-old female patient with recurrent GBM following surgical removal of the primary tumour, adjuvant treatment with temozolomide and a 3-year disease-free period. Rapid whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of three separate tumour regions at recurrence was carried out and interpreted relative to WGS of two regions of the primary tumour.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>We found extensive mutational and copy-number heterogeneity within the primary tumour. We identified a <italic>TP53</italic> mutation and two focal amplifications involving <italic>PDGFRA</italic>, <italic>KIT</italic> and <italic>CDK4</italic>, on chromosomes 4 and 12. A clonal <italic>IDH1</italic> R132H mutation in the primary, a known GBM driver event, was detectable at only very low frequency in the recurrent tumour. After sub-clonal diversification, evidence was found for a whole-genome doubling event and a translocation between the amplified regions of <italic>PDGFRA</italic>, <italic>KIT</italic> and <italic>CDK4</italic>, encoded within a double-minute chromosome also incorporating miR26a-2. The WGS analysis uncovered progressive evolution of the double-minute chromosome converging on the <italic>KIT/PDGFRA/PI3K/mTOR</italic> axis, superseding the <italic>IDH1</italic> mutation in dominance in a mutually exclusive manner at recurrence, consequently the patient was treated with imatinib. Despite rapid sequencing and cancer genome-guided therapy against amplified oncogenes, the disease progressed, and the patient died shortly after.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>This case sheds light on the dynamic evolution of a GBM tumour, defining the origins of the lethal sub-clone, the macro-evolutionary genomic events dominating the disease at recurrence and the loss of a clonal driver. Even in the era of rapid WGS analysis, cases such as this illustrate the significant hurdles for precision medicine success.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>introduction</title><p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain cancer occurring in adults and is associated with poor prognosis and a median overall survival of only 15 months [<xref rid="MDV127C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Nearly all GBM tumours recur after surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, with a median time to recurrence of 7 months [<xref rid="MDV127C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that treatment failure in cancer may be driven by intra-tumour heterogeneity (ITH), and branched tumour evolution involving genetically distinct sub-clones [<xref rid="MDV127C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Recent studies have documented widespread ITH in GBM. Sottoriva et al. [<xref rid="MDV127C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] found that each individual tumour can harbour multiple distinct copy-number profiles and transcriptomic subtypes simultaneously. Johnson et al. [<xref rid="MDV127C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] revealed spatial and temporal heterogeneity in GBM, confirmed the importance of <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>IDH1</italic> as early driver mutations [<xref rid="MDV127C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="MDV127C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and demonstrated the impact of temozolomide (TMZ) treatment on tumour evolution, with 6 of 10 tumours showing evidence of TMZ-induced hypermutation at recurrence.</p><p>In order to fully assess ITH within the life history of a single tumour and attempt to offer the patient a cancer genome-guided therapy, we implemented rapid multi-region whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in a patient with recurrent GBM. This analysis reveals the temporal and spatial evolution of a GBM tumour, defining the origins of the lethal sub-clone from a sub-clone in the primary tumour and the associated macro-evolutionary genomic events dominating the disease at recurrence, confounding treatment success.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>ethics</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient in the Hospitaux Universitaires de Geneve &#x2018;Analyse de la reponse immunologique contre les tumeurs cerebrales&#x2019; translational approved protocol IRB 03-126. Tumour material was analysed under the UCL-Cancer Institute and Pathology biobank (UCLHRTB 10/H1306/42).

She received concomitant treatment with irradiation (60 Gy in 30 fractions) and TMZ, followed by 6 monthly cycles of TMZ (200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> D1&#x2013;D5) until March 2009. She was free of symptoms for 2 years but partial seizures reappeared in early 2011. A further MRI showed a multi-focal recurrence in the right temporal area extending to the thalamus and the corpus callosum. Considering the long disease-free interval (3 years) between first treatment and recurrence, TMZ at a similar dose and schedule was prescribed again.

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV127F2">2</xref>B illustrates the optimal paths that account for the observed breakpoints and high copy-number amplifications.

Moreover, the DM derived from both higher copy-number haplotypes; conversely, the higher copy-number haplotypes on 4q12 were predominantly lost in the segments flanking the DM.

This confirmed that the recurrence specimen was most similar to the grade IV region, with the DM likely arising between the grade II and grade IV regions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV127F3">3</xref>A). The DM carries the putative GBM driver gene <italic>AVIL</italic> [<xref rid="MDV127C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], with a mutation restricted to the grade IV/recurrence lineage and linked to the focal amplification via discordant paired-end reads as well as exhibiting a high-variant allele frequency (chr12:58204830; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdv127/-/DC1">supplementary Figure S2F, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>).

To assess if the grade IV tumour shows increased activation of the PI3K pathway, we carried out immunohistochemistry against PDGFRA, PTEN and cKIT in the grade II and grade IV tumours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV127F3">3</xref>B). We found increased levels of PDGFRA (215/300 versus 93/300, grade IV versus grade II) and cKIT (222/300 versus 31/300) in the grade IV tumour, but no difference in the PTEN levels (34/300 versus 23/300). This suggests that PTEN is deactivated in both the grade II and grade IV tumours, but that the PI3K pathway is further activated in the grade IV tumour, likely due to amplification of genes encoded within the DM.

The clonal dominance of <italic>IDH1</italic> driver events might need to be considered within the context of low-frequency oncogenic drivers when examining the efficacy of therapeutics targeting <italic>IDH1</italic> in this disease [<xref rid="MDV127C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, despite rapid WGS at recurrence and cancer genome-directed therapy, imatinib was unable to control the disease. Following radiotherapy and two surgical debulking procedures, it is unlikely that the blood&#x2013;brain barrier was intact, preventing drug penetration into the central nervous system. It is more likely that treatment failure was a consequence of the evolution of the poly-oncogene/oncomir DM targeting the PI3K axis at multiple nodal points.</p><p>Moreover, our results emphasize the profound effects of cancer cell GD, resulting in accelerated cancer genome evolution, characterised by a tolerance of CIN and propagation of aneuploid progeny [<xref rid="MDV127C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The accelerated CIN permitted following the GD event in the grade IV region of the primary tumour, and possibly a chromothripsis event on chromosome 4, resulted in the formation and subsequent selection of a highly poly-oncogene&#x2013;oncomir DM encoding <italic>miR-26a-2</italic>, <italic>PDGFRA</italic>, <italic>KIT</italic> and <italic>CDK4</italic>.</p><p>MicroRNA <italic>miR-26a-2</italic> effectively targets PTEN [<xref rid="MDV127C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that PTEN expression was weak or absent relative to stromal cells in both the grade II and grade IV regions, although no genomic aberrations were detected at the <italic>PTEN</italic> locus. It is likely therefore, that amplification of <italic>CDK4</italic>/<italic>miR-26a-2</italic> region, either encoded within the DM in the grade IV region and recurrent tumour or simply due to amplification as observed in the grade II specimen, directly contributed to loss of PTEN protein expression.</p><p>Taken together, these observations emphasise the complexity of signal transduction cascades activated within individual tumours. However, it is apparent that the oncogenic drivers involved in GBM pathogenesis are highly constrained and the combination of these events involved in DMs may be finite. There is an unmet need to enrol patients within longitudinal cohort studies to define these genetic constraints in order to accelerate our understanding of GBM evolution throughout the disease course and optimise therapeutic opportunities in this disease.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>funding</title><p>This work was supported by Cancer Research UK and the <funding-source id="cs1" rid="cn1">European Commission</funding-source> 7th Framework Programme (<award-id id="cn1" rid="cs1">HEALTH-2010-F2-259303</award-id>); ZS was funded by the <funding-source id="cs2" rid="cn2">Breast Cancer Research Foundation, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences</funding-source> (<award-id id="cn2" rid="cs2">KTIA_NAP_13-2014-0021</award-id>).
