      <title>1. INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The phenomenon of
immigration has an immense impact on the health care of population in the United States. Cases of tuberculosis (TB) among foreign-born nationals, currently living in
the United States, account for more than half of the total. Recognition of this fact helps in early
detection. Atypical presentation may lead to misdiagnosis or a delay in
diagnosis. Also the absence of systemic symptoms does not rule out TB.
Radiological imaging, sputum smear, and PPD only aid in the diagnosis but a
high degree of suspicion is required to ascertain an accurate diagnosis.
Establishing an early diagnosis of TB infection and disease in a pregnant woman
is important as it affects the health of both mother and infant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p>

      <title>2. CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 21-year-old Hispanic female with a 32-week twin pregnancy presented in
preterm labor. She had immigrated to the United States 
 two years prior, and
her pregnancy course was uncomplicated except for complaints of an occasional
nonproductive cough. She was a nonsmoker, denied any history of TB exposure,
and was HBsAg and HIV negative. On general exam, she was tachypneic and anxious
but in no apparent respiratory distress. She was found to have a low oxygen
saturation of 89% on room air with a respiratory rate of 30/min and her blood
pressure was 127/76&#x2009;mmHg. Lung exam was clear to auscultation. Her uterine
fundal height corresponded to 32-week twin pregnancy and she had bilateral
pedal edema. She was also noted to have uterine contractions every 1&#x2013;3&#x2009;minutes.</p>
      <p>She was initially admitted to the labor and delivery unit in our hospital and
subsequently transferred to the medical ICU. ABG showed pH of 7.41, PaCO<sub>2</sub> of
29, PaO<sub>2</sub> of 64, bicarbonate of 18, and the base excess of &#x2212;6, saturating at 93%
on 21% FiO<sub>2</sub>. CBC showed WBC 9.9&#x2009;th/mm<sup>3</sup>, Hb, and Hct 10.8&#x2009;g/dl and 32.8%,
respectively, Platelets 432&#x2009;th/mm<sup>3</sup>. The chest X-ray demonstrated a right
paratracheal soft tissue opacity measuring approximately 
4 &#xD7; 4&#x2009;cm with a slight
elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with a linear density in the right lower
lung consistent with atelectasis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). No prior X-ray was available for comparison.
Patient was put in respiratory isolation early on and the pulmonary team was
consulted. CT showed a large extensive mediastinal soft tissue mass in the
right paratracheal region extending into the hilar and subcarinal region. An
associated atelectasis on the right upper and lower lobe with questionable
alveolar infiltrate in the right lower lobe was also found. An abdominal
ultrasound showed twin-twin transfusion with reversed end-diastolic flow on
umbilical artery doppler in twin B and the patient had an emergent low
transverse cesarean section the next day with delivery of two male infants.
Infant A had Apgars of 7 and 9, and infant B had Apgars of 0, 4, and 5,
respectively. Both infants went to the NICU, and the patient returned to the
MICU.</p>
      <p>A PPD was placed which was positive at 10&#x2009;mm after 72 hours. Successful
samples of sputum could not be obtained but a bronchoscopy with endobronchial
biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was done. Bronchoscopy showed a trachea
with diffuse mucosal
swelling and the mucosal abnormalities persisted throughout the right bronchial
tree. She also had irregular tumor growth from the anterior wall of the
proximal bronchus intermedius and the base of the proximal right upper lobe
bronchus. These two growths were sampled and the infectious disease team was
consulted. There was an abundant growth of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> but no acid-fast bacilli (AFB), fungus,
or hyphae from the BAL. The patient was started on Vancomycin and Clindamycin
to cover Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) which was later changed to Moxifloxacin based on
sensitivities. Transbronchial biopsy of the right bronchus intermedius showed
inflammatory and squamous debris with ulceration, reactive squamous epithelium,
and colonizing coccal bacteria. Endobronchial biopsy of the proximal bronchus
wall showed caseating granulomatous inflammation.</p>
      <p>The treatment of this young Hispanic immigrant
female with an occasional cough, positive PPD, questionable alveolar
infiltrate, caseating granulomatous inflammation and no significant evidence of
TB infection posed a definite challenge. Given her high risk for TB, she was
empirically started on INH, Rifampin, Ethambutol, and Pyrazinamide. It was only
on Day 26 that <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> was isolated by DNA probe from her right lung tissue which was subsequently
confirmed on culture. The infants were started on INH prophylaxis after
placental pathology did not demonstrate evidence of TB. Patient was discharged
to home in a stable condition to be followed up at the local TB center for
direct observation therapy.</p>

      <title>3. DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Among the communicable diseases, TB is the second leading cause of death
worldwide, killing nearly 2 million people each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The World Health
Organization estimates that 2 billion people have latent TB, in addition to the
3 million people worldwide who die each year due to TB. After a resurgence of
TB in the United States 
 between 1985&#x2013;1992, the decline
noticed during 1993&#x2013;2005 has slowed
down causing concerns that the progress achieved in eliminating TB is slowing
down [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Immigration demographics demonstrate that Asians, blacks, and
Hispanics essentially bear the burden of TB in immigrants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The number of TB
cases due to foreign-born individuals has increased each year since 1993. In
1996, 10% of the 20,973 US TB cases were among foreign-born Hispanic persons,
with the four states bordering Mexico 
 accounting for 83% of foreign-born Hispanic cases. Mexicans accounted for 22.9%
of foreign-born patients or 8.4% of all US cases and persons born in Central America comprised an additional 4.7% of foreign-born
patients or 1.7% of all US cases. Guatemala and El Salvador contributed to nearly 75% of these
cases and the remaining were from the rest of Central
 America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">4</xref>]. In 2005, when
compared between foreign-born persons in the United States 
 and US-born persons,
the TB rates were 8.7 times higher in
immigrants; with Hispanics, Blacks, and Asians having TB rates 7.3, 8.3, and
19.6 times higher, respectively, than those of whites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p>
      <p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is transmitted by airborne droplet nuclei, which may
contain fewer than 10 bacilli and humans are the only known reservoir for <italic>M.
tuberculosis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">5</xref>]. Individuals at high risk for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in industrialized countries include (i) individuals likely to be
exposed to or become infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>: close contacts of a
patient with infectious TB, foreign-born individuals from high-incidence areas,
the elderly, residents of long-term care facilities (e.g., correctional
facilities and nursing homes), IV drugs abusers, other groups identified
locally as having increased prevalence of TB (e.g., migrant farm workers or
homeless persons), and individuals who may have occupational exposure to TB; and
(ii) individuals at high risk of developing TB disease once infected: individuals
recently infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (within the past 2 years),
HIV-infected individuals, individuals with immunosuppressing conditions or
medication use, individuals with a history of inadequately treated TB, and
infants. Chances that an individual acquires infection depend on the
infectiousness of the index case, duration of the exposure, environment
(crowding, poor ventilation), and virulence of the organism.</p>
      <p>Atypical presentations and slow confirmation by culture often delay the
diagnosis and treatment of patients with TB. Other reasons include an under use
of tuberculin skin tests, misinterpretation of unusual chest X-rays, and
waiting for culture results in patients with AFB-negative smears [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>Chest radiography is often reliable and an important investigation. Generally,
in TB, a segmental pneumonic process is seen but may be too small to visualize
radiographically or complicated by atelectasis from the raised diaphragm
compressing the lower lung fields in pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">8</xref>]. Upper zone shadowing,
often bilateral and likely associated with cavitation or miliary shadowing are
the classic findings. New findings like soft
shadowing amongst old, fibrotic changes generally indicate a relapse.
Paratracheal, mediastinal, and hilar lymphadenopathy, though not unusual in
African and Indian patients with TB or in children, are generally unusual in
immunocompetent adults like ours. In patients infected with HIV, the
radiological appearances could often be nonspecific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>In our patient, the situation was complicated by a right lower lobe infiltrate.
The infiltrate could have been misdiagnosed as atelectasis in a woman with a 32-week
twin pregnancy. Tuberculin skin test in our patient was read as 10&#x2009;mm. Five
millimeters is considered to be positive in individuals with HIV, on steroid
therapy, or in individuals in close contact with a person with active TB. Our
patient denied any contact with TB. Larger reactions of greater than or equal
to 10&#x2009;mm are considered positive in recent (within the last five years)
immigrants from high-prevalence countries, in individuals with diabetes, renal
failure, and health-care workers, among others. Our patient falls into this
category. In individuals with no known risks for TB, a positive reaction
requires a 15&#x2009;mm or greater induration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>Many patients with suspected pulmonary TB do not produce sputum spontaneously
or are smear-negative for AFB. We could not obtain sputum sample in our patient
due to absence of a productive cough and sputum induction was also
unsuccessful. Though the BAL sample did not show any AFB, the biopsy showed
caseating granuloma which could be found both in tubercular and nontubercular
mycobacterial infections or fungal infections due to <italic>Coccidioides immitis</italic> and <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic>. It was ultimately a DNA probe from her lung
tissue that grew <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> after 26 days.</p>
      <p>With the use of PCR, nucleic acid sequences unique to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> can be detected directly in clinical specimens with better accuracy and urgency
than AFB smear and culture, respectively. Probes are used for rapid
identification and maximizing cost effectiveness. Used alone or in combination
with other identification methods, they serve as a substitute for biochemical
testing and are also more accurate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">11</xref>]. Molecular tests in combination with
&#x201C;classic tests&#x201D; can enhance the diagnostic ability particularly in
pauci-bacillary infections and in patients with atypical presentations like
ours.</p>
      <p>The risk of TB to health-care workers is real. In the early 1990s, many urban US 
 hospitals reported purified protein derivative (PPD) conversion rates in health-care
workers of 3&#x2013;5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">15</xref>]. A survey of US 
 hospitals conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
found a mean conversion rate of 1.6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">17</xref>]. More recent studies have
demonstrated rates of around 1% annually. Efficient control of nosocomial TB is
compromised by the same difficulties complicating community control hence a high degree of suspicion is required to recognise and isolate patients with
TB. An improved clinical acumen, development of rapid diagnostic tests, and the
institution of early empiric therapy are desirable to control this disease. We
combined the use of bronchoscopy and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> complex-PCR which
provided a good diagnostic yield in our patient.</p>
      <p>An early diagnosis of TB infection in a pregnant woman is important as better
results are seen in women who are detected with TB and have been treated before
the onset of pregnancy or earlier in its course, when compared with untreated
patients with TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">18</xref>]. Infant and
maternal mortality are between 30% and 40% in untreated active TB cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">19</xref>].
Treatment should also be initiated when the probability is moderate-to-high.
Although the drugs in the initial treatment regime cross the placenta, these
concentrations do not appear to have harmful effect on the fetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">20</xref>]. Pregnant
women with TB should also be tested for HIV as there is a higher incidence of
extrapulmonary TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) in this set of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">18</xref>].
Breast feeding should not be discouraged in women being treated with first-line
antituberculosis drugs because the concentrations in the breast milk are
subtherapeutic and too low to produce toxicity in the nursing new born. The
risks of second-line medications are unknown. The effect would likely be much
lower if the mother breast feeds before taking the medication. Similarly,
breast milk is also inadequate as a treatment option for TB or latent TB
infection in newborns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">19</xref>]. Close follow up of patients is essential since
current therapy for TB infection is long and suboptimal adherence may result in
failure of therapy.</p>
      <p>Congenital TB is rare with symptoms typically developing during the second or
third week of life which include poor feeding, poor weight gain, cough,
lethargy, and irritability. Other symptoms include fever, ear discharge, and
skin lesions. Two possible routes of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in utero
are (a) hematogenous infection through the umbilical vein, with primary lesions
in the liver and occasional porta hepatis lymphadenopathy; and (b) prenatal
aspiration of infected fluid, with predominant pulmonary and gastrointestinal
disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">22</xref>]. The criteria for congenital TB requires the infant to have a
tuberculous lesion (e.g., infiltrates on the chest radiograph or granulomas)
and at least one of the following: (a) onset during the first week of life, (b)
presence of a primary hepatic TB complex or caseating hepatic granulomas, (c)
infection of the placenta or maternal genital tract, or (d) exclusion of
postnatal transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">22</xref>].</p>
      <p> The role of Bacillus of Calmette-Gu&#xE9;rin (BCG) vaccine in preventing TB in
adults is debatable due to its variable efficacy (0&#x2013;80%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">23</xref>]. Its efficacy in
prevention of tuberculous meningitis and miliary TB in young children has been
easier to document than in adults or in the prevention of pulmonary TB in both
children and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">24</xref>]. The Centers for Disease Control has made the
following recommendations concerning BCG vaccination in the US 
 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">25</xref>]. (i)
BCG vaccination should be considered in infants and children 5 years if
the child is exposed continually to an untreated or ineffectively treated
patient with infectious pulmonary TB, if the child cannot be separated from the presence
of the infectious patient or be given long-term primary preventive therapy, or if the child is exposed
continually to a patient with infectious pulmonary TB caused by <italic>M.
tuberculosis</italic> strains resistant to isoniazid and rifampin and the child
cannot be separated from the presence of the infectious patient. (ii) Health-care
workers in high-risk settings should be considered on an individual basis
in settings in which a high percentage of TB patients are infected with <italic>M.
tuberculosis</italic> strains resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin, transmission
and subsequent infection are likely and where comprehensive TB
infection-control precautions have been implemented and have not been
successful.</p>

      <title>4. CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>Our case emphasizes the significance of identifying infectious diseases like TB
in developing countries due to a change in demographics. It also underscores
the importance of an early diagnosis and treatment even in the backdrop of
confounding evidence in pregnant women due to better maternal and perinatal
outcomes. A heightened index of suspicion and awareness of the rapid advances
and innovations made in the diagnosis of TB is also essential for better
control of this disease.</p>
