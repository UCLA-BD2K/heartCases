    <p>A 66-year-old man sought medical care at the hospital due to severe chest pain lasting for
24 hours. The patient was aware of being hypertensive and was a smoker. Without any prior
symptom, he started to have severe chest pain and sought emergency medical care after about
24 hours, due to pain persistence.</p>
    <p>At physical examination (August 13, 2005, 10 PM) he had a heart rate of 90 bpm and blood
pressure of 110/70 mmHg. Lung examination showed no alterations. Heart assessment showed a
systolic murmur in the lower left sternal border and mitral area.</p>
    <p>The initial electrocardiogram (August 13, 2005, 22 h) showed HR of 100 bpm, sinus rhythm,
1<sup>st</sup>-degree atrioventricular block (PR 240 ms), low-voltage QRS complexes in
the frontal plane, QRS complex electrical alternans and extensive ongoing anterior wall
infarction (QS V1 to V6, ST elevation in the same leads and QS in the inferior wall, II,
III and aVF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

    <p>Coronary angiography was indicated, which disclosed anterior interventricular branch
occlusion and images suggestive of intracoronary thrombus, lesion of 70% in the circumflex
artery, 50% in the right coronary artery and 70% in the ostium of the right posterior
descending branch. Angioplasty was performed with stent implant in the anterior
interventricular artery, but distal flow was not restored. This was followed by cardiac
arrest in asystole, which did not respond to treatment and the patient died.</p>

      <title>Clinical Aspects</title>
      <p>This clinical case reports on a 66-year-old hypertensive patient, long-term smoker, who
sought medical care due to acute chest pain. The main diagnostic hypothesis for this
clinical case is of acute coronary syndrome.</p>
      <p>Chest pain is one of the most common reasons for seeking emergency care and remains a
challenge for the clinician, due to the difficulty in differentiating between
non-emergency diagnoses and those of high morbidity and mortality, such as acute
coronary syndrome (ACS), aortic dissection and pulmonary thromboembolism.</p>
      <p>In the assessment of acute chest pain, there are three basic parameters for its
management: clinical examination (clinical history and physical examination),
electrocardiogram (ECG) and myocardial necrosis markers. They should be analyzed
together to provide a safer approach to the patient, especially when it is necessary
ruling out ACS. Chest radiography, chest Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA),
echocardiography and other tests may be useful in the differential diagnosis.</p>
      <p>Approximately 15-25% of patients presenting in the ER with chest pain are diagnosed with
acute coronary syndrome, and this represents its more frequent clinical
manifestation<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, in
the first step of the evaluation, which is the clinical examination, the greater
determinant of an ischemic etiology is the characteristic presence of angina.</p>
      <p>Angina is often described as a burning or compression sensation or difficulty breathing,
located in the precordial region or any other region of the chest, radiating to the
neck, shoulder and left arm. It usually increases in intensity within minutes and may be
accompanied by symptoms such as nausea and sweating. It can be triggered by physical or
emotional stress and relieved by rest or use of nitrates. It should also be remembered
that ACS can occur without obvious precipitating factors and be asymptomatic or present
as ischemic equivalent, especially in the elderly and diabetic patients with autonomic
dysfunction (dyspnea, syncope and pre-syncope).</p>
      <p>On the other hand, there are characteristics of pain that make the diagnosis of ACS
unlikely, such as pleuritic pain (reproduced by respiratory movements) located with the
fingertip, pain in meso/hypogastrium region and reproduction of pain with local
palpation or movement. These features raise the suspicion of other differential
diagnoses such as pericarditis, pleuritis, gastrointestinal or musculoskeletal
diseases.</p>
      <p>In the present case report, the patient presented with prolonged chest pain, which does
not rule out acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but raises the possibility of some condition
associated with this coronary picture, such as pericarditis or mechanical
complications.</p>
      <p>Among the most important risk factors for atherosclerotic disease risk are dyslipidemia,
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, male gender, older age, obesity/metabolic syndrome,
smoking, sedentary lifestyle, chronic kidney disease, depression and stress. This
patient had some risk factors that contributed to the development of coronary artery
disease: age, male gender, hypertension and smoking.</p>
      <p>Patients with chest pain and ACS often have a nonspecific physical examination, with
less than 20% of them showing significant alterations in the initial
evaluation<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. This becomes
important by helping in the detection of differential diagnoses (e.g., pericardial
friction rub in pericarditis) or by inferring the presence of risk factors for coronary
artery disease (abdominal or carotid murmur, among others).</p>
      <p>However, when findings resulting from an ACS are present, they indicate a worse
prognosis due to mechanical complications or due to a large area of myocardium at risk
and ventricular dysfunction (hypotension, tachycardia, pulmonary edema and mitral
regurgitation murmur secondary to ischemia).</p>
      <p>The electrocardiogram is important in the diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic
approach and must be obtained within 10 minutes after the presentation of patients with
ongoing chest pain<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. A normal
electrocardiographic tracing does not exclude the possibility of ACS and a serial ECG is
indicated, which increases its sensitivity and helps differentiating between acute and
chronic alterations.</p>
      <p>The patient reported in this clinical case had, at the admission ECG performed at
another service, ST-segment elevation in the anterior wall, suggesting the hypothesis of
acute coronary syndrome with ST-segment elevation. However, this ECG also showed low
voltage and electrical alternans of the QRS complex, which suggests large pericardial
effusion or even cardiac tamponade.</p>
      <p>The main hypothesis for this pericardial effusion is a mechanical complication of
myocardial infarction: left ventricular free wall rupture. It occurs within 24 hours
after infarction or between the third and fifth day, has an incidence of 0.8 to 6.2% and
is more common in an extensive myocardial infarction, in the elderly, women and
hypertensive patients. Its clinical course is variable<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and may be acute and severe, leading to sudden death or
subacute, with nonspecific clinical manifestations.</p>
      <p>Other mechanical complications that may be present in myocardial infarction are
papillary muscle and interventricular septum rupture. These complications do not present
with significant pericardial effusion and normal pulmonary auscultation in this patient
also makes the diagnosis of papillary muscle rupture less likely. This clinical
condition presents with pulmonary congestion due to volume overload secondary to acute
mitral regurgitation.</p>
      <p>Another diagnostic hypothesis for this patient presenting with chest pain and
pericardial effusion would be aortic dissection. Pain, in these cases, is usually of
sudden onset and strong intensity since the beginning (unlike angina pain, which often
increasingly escalates). It is often described as excruciating and its location reflects
the site and progression of the dissection. Autonomic signs (pallor, profuse sweating)
are greatly associated.</p>
      <p>In aortic dissection, physical examination may disclose hypertensive crisis, differences
between limb pulses, signs of pleural and pericardial effusion, diastolic murmur of
aortic regurgitation, different from the systolic murmur detected in this clinical case.
The extension of the dissection to other vessels can lead to other symptoms
corresponding to ischemia of the organs irrigated by them: cerebrovascular accident,
acute myocardial infarction, mesenteric ischemia, etc.</p>
      <p>Another diagnostic hypothesis for the clinical case is pulmonary embolism. The absence
of pulmonary symptoms, mainly dyspnea, makes this hypothesis less likely. It is the most
common symptom of this disease, occurring in over 78% of the patients<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Sudden chest pain of sudden onset and
very often pleuritic, affects up to 44% of patients<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Cough and hemoptysis may also occur. Additionally, there was no
mention is made on admission at the other service, of right ventricular dysfunction
manifestations, such as jugular stasis and hypotension.</p>
      <p>The patient, an hour and 36 minutes after his admission at the Heart Institute, was
submitted to coronary angiography with left anterior descending artery angioplasty.
However, he developed asystole and cardiac arrest.</p>
      <p>The main diagnoses for the final clinical picture are cardiogenic shock and/or
distributive shock due to cardiac tamponade, discussed below.</p>
      <p>The hypothesis of cardiogenic shock should be considered, as the patient had an
extensive acute myocardial infarction without culprit artery reperfusion even after
percutaneous revascularization attempt. However, this diagnosis cannot fully explain the
patient's clinical condition, such as the absence of pulmonary congestion, which usually
follows an acute myocardial failure.</p>
      <p>Considering the patient's history, late cardiac tamponade seems to have been the main
precipitating factor of the final clinical picture in this case. The
electrocardiographic findings commonly observed in cardiac tamponade are low voltage and
electrical alternans of the QRS complex, observed in the case. Although physical
examination made no reference to clinical findings suggestive of tamponade, such as
jugular stasis or muffled heart sounds, we cannot exclude this diagnostic
hypothesis.</p>
      <p>An echocardiography could have been performed to confirm this diagnosis, which is the
most widely used noninvasive method for diagnostic investigation of this pathology. The
ventriculography in this context would not be informative, as it was a free wall rupture
with cardiac tamponade and thus, it would not allow the visualization of contrast
leakage into the pericardial cavity.</p>
      <p>This is a patient with myocardial infarction that came at the emergency room more than
24 hours after the onset of the event and who probably had a mechanical complication of
myocardial infarction: ventricular free wall rupture.</p>
      <p>Most deaths from myocardial infarction occur in the first hours of disease onset, with
40-65% occurring within the first hour and approximately 80% in the first 24
hours<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. The recently implemented therapies for MI treatment have been
proven to modify patient evolution and prognosis. However, the effectiveness of most of
these measures is time-dependent and delay in seeking medical care may have been the
factor that likely contributed to the clinical outcome of the patient in this case

      <p>The heart weighed 414 g. The myocardium of the left ventricular anterosseptal wall and
right ventricular anterior wall was softened, slightly yellowish in color,
characterizing extensive transmural acute myocardial infarction. There was an obvious
narrowing of the affected anterosseptal wall, with ventricular septum rupture in the
anterior region of its mid portion, with a ventricular septal defect measuring 10 mm in
its longest axis. The other left ventricular walls showed to be slightly hypertrophic
and there was a small area of fibrosis in the postero-inferior region of the ventricular
septum. There was also moderate right ventricular dilation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

      <title>Comments</title>
      <p>This is the case report of a 66-year-old man with systemic hypertension and a chronic
smoker that presented with acute severe chest pain. After medical assessment, he was
diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction and the patient underwent coronary
angiography, which disclosed proximal occlusion of the left anterior descending artery
with images suggesting the presence of thrombi. He was submitted to balloon-angioplasty
in the affected segment without restoration of distal coronary flow (unsuccessful
procedure) and the patient developed irreversible cardiac arrest and died.</p>
      <p>The autopsy confirmed acute myocardial infarction, which was very extensive, affecting
the left ventricular anterosseptal wall and the right ventricular anterior wall.
Histological dating was 24-48 hours of onset, consistent with the clinical history. It
is noteworthy the fact that the detailed examination of the ventricular septum showed
the presence of two previous microinfarctions, an old (healed) one and an ongoing
one.</p>
      <p>The presence of atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries was identified, with massive
plaques in the proximal segment of the left anterior descending artery, which resulted
in chronic obstruction of 80% of the lumen. The fatty plaques had extensive lipid cores
and there were areas of marked thinning of the fibrous cap that covered the cores, as
well as areas of rupture associated with acute thrombosis of the remaining lumen in the
first two centimeters of the left anterior descending artery. It is known that acute
coronary occlusions with luminal thrombosis are usually associated with large lipid-core
plaques, which undergo rupture due to the instability of their thin fibrous
cap<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, as observed in this
case.</p>
      <p>Aside from the great extent of the infarcted area, the patient developed an important
mechanical complication of acute myocardial infarction, the occurrence of ventricular
septal rupture with the establishment of VSD<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> - which certainly aggravated his hemodynamic condition,
progressing to cardiogenic shock -, acute pulmonary edema and death. It should be
emphasized that the patient had two classic risk factors for atherosclerosis and
myocardial infarction: systemic hypertension and chronic smoking<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. <bold>(Dr. Luiz Alberto
Benvenuti)</bold></p>
