        <p>LHX4 is a LIM homeodomain transcription factor involved in the early steps of pituitary ontogenesis. To date, 8 heterozygous <italic>LHX4</italic> mutations have been reported as responsible of combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) in Humans. We identified 4 new <italic>LHX4</italic> heterozygous allelic variants in patients with congenital hypopituitarism: <italic>W204X</italic>, <italic>delK242</italic>, <italic>N271S</italic> and <italic>Q346R</italic>. Our objective was to determine the role of LHX4 variants in patients&#x2019; phenotypes. Heterologous HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding for wild-type or mutant LHX4. Protein expression was analysed by Western Blot, and DNA binding by electro-mobility shift assay experiments. Target promoters of LHX4 were cotransfected with wild type or mutant LHX4 to test the transactivating abilities of each variant. Our results show that the <italic>W204X</italic> mutation was associated with early GH and TSH deficiencies and later onset ACTH deficiency. It led to a truncated protein unable to bind to alpha-Gsu promoter binding consensus sequence. W204X was not able to activate target promoters <italic>in vitro</italic>. Cotransfection experiments did not favour a dominant negative effect. In contrast, all other mutants were able to bind the promoters and led to an activation similar as that observed with wild type LHX4, suggesting that they were likely polymorphisms. To conclude, our study underlines the need for functional in vitro studies to ascertain the role of rare allelic variants of LHX4 in disease phenotypes. It supports the causative role of the <italic>W204X</italic> mutation in CPHD and adds up childhood onset ACTH deficiency to the clinical spectrum of the various phenotypes related to <italic>LHX4</italic> mutations.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Pituitary ontogenesis requires a precise temporal and spatial regulation of several early and late-acting transcription factors, such as LIM (LIN-11, Isl1 and MEC-3) domain transcription factors (LHX4, LHX3, LHX2 or ISL1)[<xref rid="pone.0126648.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126648.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In Humans, mutations of some of the genes coding for these transcription factors lead to combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD)[<xref rid="pone.0126648.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. CPHD is a rare condition defined by the presence of at least two anterior pituitary hormone lineage deficiencies, associated with variable pituitary and extra-pituitary anomalies on MRI.</p>
      <p>Lhx4 is specifically involved in the early steps of pituitary ontogenesis[<xref rid="pone.0126648.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0126648.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although the roles of Lhx4 might be redundant at some developmental stages with those of Lhx3 (4)(6), proper expression of Lhx4 is crucial not only for the development of the rudimentary Rathke&#x2019;s pouch into the mature pituitary, but also for the development of other organs such as the lungs. Murine models indeed showed that <italic>Lhx4</italic> homozygous inactivation (<italic>lhx4</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>) led to an early death due to pulmonary failure: mice presented hypoplastic Rathke&#x2019;s pouch with a decreased number of the precursors of the five anterior pituitary lineages. In contrast, mice with <italic>Lhx4</italic> heterozygous inactivation (<italic>lhx4</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup>) had a normal phenotype[<xref rid="pone.0126648.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>In humans, <italic>LHX4</italic> mutations are rare[<xref rid="pone.0126648.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126648.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In our cohort of patients with CPHD, only 3 mutations have been reported among the 321 patients screened to date in view of compatible phenotypic profiles (unpublished data). Since the first reported <italic>LHX4</italic> mutation, advances have been made on the phenotypic characterization and outcome of patients carrying <italic>LHX4</italic> mutations. We and others have for instance emphasized the large intra- and inter- familial variability of the phenotype. Precise profile of patients to be screened for mutations of <italic>LHX4</italic> remains difficult to determine, as only eight <italic>LHX4</italic> mutations transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait have been reported in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0126648.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126648.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0126648.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Patients were presenting with CPHD, but the number and nature of deficient pituitary lineages were variable; extra-pituitary anomalies could be absent or include ectopic posterior pituitary, abnormal sella turcica shape or abnormal corpus callosum.</p>
      <p>Four new <italic>LHX4</italic> allelic variants have been found in five distinct pedigrees through the GENHYPOPIT network, an international network that collected DNA samples and phenotype data from more than 1000 patients with CPHD. We report here the phenotypes of the patients, the results of the functional studies, and extend the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of <italic>LHX4</italic> mutations. Our results also raise the difficulties in proving the deleterious effect of unknown allelic variants.</p>

        <p>The GENHYPOPIT network was launched as a multicentric study involving both French and international pediatric and adult endocrinology centers. Screening of <italic>LHX4</italic> mutations was performed in patients with specific phenotypes as previously described (8). Hormonal studies and intracranial imaging were performed in all patients in each referring medical center. On MRI, malformations were systematically sought and recorded. Patients with a known postnatal cause of acquired hypopituitarism were excluded. After written informed consent was given, blood samples were collected from patients and, whenever possible, first-degree relatives. Informed written consent was obtained from the parents, caretakers or guardians on behalf of the minor/children enrolled in the study. The study was approved by the Ethics committee of the University of Aix-Marseille II (France).</p>

        <p><italic>LHX4</italic> sequence was amplified from perip heral blood DNA. Genomic analysis of <italic>LHX4</italic> was performed by direct sequencing. The six coding exons of <italic>LHX4</italic> were amplified from genomic DNA using exon-flanking primers as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0126648.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

        <p>pcDNA3.1 LHX4-myc plasmid was a gift from S. Rhodes (Indianapolis, USA). <italic>In vitro</italic> site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Stratagene cloning system, La Jolla, CA). In brief, 100-ng template DNA was incubated with Accuprime DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, France) and the sense and antisense primers containing the desired mutation. The reaction comprised 18 cycles consisting of 15 sec denaturation at 95&#xB0;C, 30 sec annealing at 55&#xB0;C, and 6.5 min extension at 68&#xB0;C. After purification (NucleoSpin plasmid Miniprep kit, Macherey-Nagel) and amplification of the mutated plasmid the correct sequence was confirmed by sequencing. Notice that due to the truncated nature of the protein encoded by <italic>W204X LHX4</italic>, a specific primer design had to be considered to keep the myc C-terminal tag in frame. Mutagenesis primers used for each allelic variant are available on request.</p>
        <p>Reporter constructs containing different gene-regulatory regions with putative LIM factor binding sites were fused to a firefly luciferase gene. These constructs included the proximal promoter regions of the human <italic>PRL</italic> gene (PRL-250) (a gift of J. A.

        <p>HEK293T cells were cultured in 12-well plate and transfected as follows: 200 ng reporter constructs (TSHb, PRL-250, AlphaGsu, or POU1F1 promoter) and 200&#x2013;400 ng effector construct (pcDNA3.1 empty vector or wild- type or mutant LHX4) per well were cotransfected using the liposome technique (Polyfect transfection reagent; QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Total DNA was kept constant with pcDNA3.1 empty vector, which also acted as a control. Transfection efficiency was determined using 15 ng pCMV-Renilla, and used to normalize the luciferase firefly values. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection.

          <p>The propositus was referred to an endocrinologist at the age of two years because of growth delay. TSH and GH deficiencies were diagnosed and the patient received L-thyroxin and GH replacement therapy. Corticotroph deficiency was diagnosed later, at the age of nine, as the patient was suffering from asthenia. Hydrocortisone was therefore initiated (20 mg/day). Due to the prepubertal age of the propositus, FSH/LH deficiency was not evaluated. Pituitary MRI, performed at the age of two, showed a hypoplastic pituitary, and an ectopic posterior lobe. The pituitary stalk was not visualized. No extra-pituitary malformation was found.</p>

      <title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
      <p><italic>W204X</italic> mutation represents a new pathogenic allelic variant of <italic>LHX4</italic> found in a patient presenting with combined pituitary hormone deficiency. Identification of <italic>LHX4</italic> mutations linked to such defects have rarely been reported in the literature (8 mutations reported to date) [<xref rid="pone.0126648.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0126648.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and in our large GENHYPOPIT cohort of patients with CPHD (3 mutations in 321 patients screened, unpublished data). This rarity may, at least in part, be due to the fact that homozygous <italic>LHX4</italic> mutations are likely lethal in Humans: this is suggested by the fact that patients bearing <italic>LHX4</italic> mutations were always reported as heterozygous, and that mice with homozygous inactivation of <italic>Lhx4</italic> died shortly after birth[<xref rid="pone.0126648.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Comparison with the murine model is however difficult, as mice with heterozygous inactivation of <italic>Lhx4</italic> are unaffected[<xref rid="pone.0126648.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>The mechanism by which <italic>W204X</italic> mutation leads to a functionally defective protein is an abnormal DNA binding, as shown by the results of EMSA experiments. The functional alteration induced by this new mutation could also have been due to nonsense-mediated RNA decay. However, the mutant protein is expressed in our cells, as shown by Western blot results, argueing against this hypothesis. Abnormal DNA binding could be expected as the protein lacks a part of the homeodomain. We had previously reported such a mechanism for the <italic>Thr99fs LHX4</italic> mutation (8), but the predicted truncated protein was lacking the whole homeodomain. Our results suggest that LHX4 amino acids 204&#x2013;215, which encode for the third DNA-recognizing alpha-helix of the homeodomain, are crucial for proper DNA binding. Consistent with our results, Pfaeffle <italic>et al</italic>. had previously shown that a point mutation in this area (<italic>A210P</italic>) also led to abnormal DNA binding[<xref rid="pone.0126648.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>Delayed corticotroph deficiency (that appeared by the age of 9) is the main striking phenotypic feature of our patient bearing <italic>W204X</italic> mutation. This delayed deficiency had been reported at age 16 in another patient carrying <italic>LHX4 R84X</italic> mutation[<xref rid="pone.0126648.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is surprising as the other patients with <italic>LHX4</italic> mutations had early dysfunction of pituitary lineages. However, the father of the propositus carrying <italic>Thr99fs</italic> mutation had normal size, as did 2 children carrying the same mutation, despite GH and LH/FSH deficiency diagnosed by the age of 40 [<xref rid="pone.0126648.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This suggested that delayed onset deficiencies can be observed in patients with <italic>LHX4</italic> mutations. Delayed corticotroph, GH and TSH deficiencies have already been reported in patients carrying mutations of <italic>PROP1</italic>, a paired homeodomain transcription factor, involved in later stages of pituitary development [<xref rid="pone.0126648.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126648.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For these 2 transcription factors, the mechanisms of delayed deficiency remain however unknown [<xref rid="pone.0126648.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>Our functional studies did not show any deleterious effect of the three allelic variants <italic>DelK242</italic>, <italic>N271S and Q346R</italic>. Despite the fact that these variants have not been identified in SNP databases (data not shown), and that the patients were presenting with phenotypes compatible with <italic>LHX4</italic> mutations, our results supported their classification as rare polymorphisms (<italic>ie</italic>. they were not responsible for the phenotype of CPHD). Of note, the delK242 variant has been found in a heterozygous state in 3 individuals (3 out of 6259, i.e., 0.05%) from an American population, (see Exome Variant Server website URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/">http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/</ext-link>). Other genes coding for transcription factors have been screened, but no clear etiology could be identified. Other as yet unknown transcription factors or pathways might be involved in the phenotypes. Environmental causes during pregnancy may also be involved. Another possibility could be that our functional studies, performed in heterologous cells (chosen as they were not expressing endogenous LHX4), in an in vitro system, and on a limited number of target genes, did not manage to show a true defective mechanism due, for instance, to the lack of the cofactors network found in pituitary cells. These results however are consistent with the fact that the 3 amino-acids were located in non-functional domains, and that in silico analysis was in favour of silent polymorphisms. Nevertheless, defective mutations in supposedly non-functioning domains have already been reported for other transcription factors: for instance, LHX3 lacking a small part of its C-terminus domain (<italic>LHX3 W224X</italic>) has been shown to be functionally defective. It can be noted also that <italic>in silico</italic> analysis is not always reliable: <italic>LHX4 V101A</italic> and <italic>A210P</italic> mutants had indeed been considered as silent polymorphisms by prediction software, whereas functional studies showed that they had decreased transactivating abilities on pituitary hormone promoters [<xref rid="pone.0126648.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126648.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Analysing the potential pathogenic status of allelic variants by <italic>in silico</italic> analysis and on the basis of <italic>in vitro</italic> functional studies clearly suggests the need for a global approach of such new allelic variants, including both approaches, as well as disease segregation in the family: this last parameter might also be misleading, as shown by the example of the father of the propositus carrying <italic>c</italic>.<italic>293InsC</italic> mutation who had a normal gonadotroph axis, allowing him to transmit the mutation to his 2 affected children, and who finally had delayed gonadotroph deficiency at the time of molecular diagnosis [<xref rid="pone.0126648.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. All these points clearly show the difficulty in determining the pathogenic nature of some variants. Moreover identifying a patient with a presumed polymorphism does not rule out the need for a close monitoring over time to allow for timely diagnosis and treatment of pituitary hormone deficits of possibly delayed onset.</p>
      <p>To conclude, we report here four new allelic variants of <italic>LHX4</italic>, including one unequivocally deleterious mutation responsible for an unusual CPHD phenotype with delayed corticotroph deficiency. The fact that the 3 other variants were identified in patients with phenotypes compatible with <italic>LHX4</italic> mutations emphasizes the difficulties in determining the pathogenicity of such variants, using <italic>in vitro</italic> functional studies. Indeed, some uncertainty remains as to the accuracy of such studies to predict the possible involvement of such rare allelic variations in the observed phenotype. Identifying new etiologies of CPHD should allow improving the management of patients with yet unknown clear explanation of their phenotype.</p>
