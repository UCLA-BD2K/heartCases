        <p>Annular erythema (AE) associated with anti-Ro (SSA) and/or La (SSB) autoantibody in patients with Sj&#xF6;gren syndrome (SS) or with SS/systemic lupus erythematosus overlap syndrome (SS/SLE), has recently been described in Orientals, and it may be a counterpart of annular skin lesion of the subacute cutaneous LE seen mostly in Caucasians. The author examined five Korean AE patients in respect to dinical diversity. In this small-sample study, subtle differences appeared between individual cases regarding the serologic features and the diagnoses of the disease. Among the five cases, four had circulating anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, and one had only anti-La. Regarding the diagnosis, one was SS/SLE, two were primary SS, and the remaining two were only "AE associated with anti-Ro/La antibody". There seem to be a wide clinical spectrum in the disease expression of AE associated with anti-Ro/La autoantibody than previously thought.</p>
