      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Morbid obesity has become a very common problem worldwide, causing severe
health-related consequences including cardiovascular or metabolic diseases,
arthritis, sleep apnea, or an increased risk of cancer<sup>[<xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Bariatric surgery was shown to
be the only way to achieve sustainable weight loss and to decrease the frequency and
severity of metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities<sup>[<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric
band (LAGB) is in many countries, especially in Europe and
Australia<sup>[<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>, the
most frequently used technique<sup>[<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>, even though others such as the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
or biliopancreatic diversion are still performed<sup>[<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. The mortality rate in bariatric surgery is
between 0.05 and 2%, the most frequent cause of death being an anastomotic leak with
subsequent infection<sup>[<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Overall, between 10 and 25% of all bariatric patients need a
revision surgery for failure of the primary procedure, either determined by
inadequate weight loss or surgical complications<sup>[<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. The mortality is increased if revision surgery
is needed<sup>[<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this article is to present a potential complication of abdominal
surgery re-entry for gastric band correction at the level of the aorta having in the
end a lethal outcome.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 26 years old woman with morbid obesity was admitted for bariatric surgery
(laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding). The patient was released from the
hospital after three days. After about four months she was admitted again, with an
initial diagnosis of superior digestive hemorrhage and status post gastric banding.
Clinically, the patient was conscious, cooperative, without signs of peritoneal
irritation, with an arterial pressure of 110/60 mmHg. Radiological examination
revealed an anteriorly malrotated ring, intraparietal filling with a radiopaque
material, and a small retro-parietal fistula in the gastric fundus. As the patient
presented superior digestive hemorrhage and ring malrotation a surgical intervention
was performed, whose aim was to extract the band. Laparoscopy was performed with the
trocars located above the umbilicus, in the left flank, left and right hypochondriac
area, and in the epigastrium.</p>
      <p>During the surgical intervention, the rubber hose of the ring was associated a severe
inflammatory reaction, incorporating the abdominal esophagus, the cardiac area of
the stomach, and the celiac region. A difficult sharp dissection was started for
viscerolysis; while trying to mobilize the ring that was identified red, arterial
blood flowing through the nasogastric tube. The procedure was immediately converted
to a xiphoid-umbilical laparotomy associated with gastrotomy step in which were
evacuated large blood clots from the stomach; the source of bleeding was found to be
a laceration of about two centimeters at the anterior part of the aorta, located
posteriorly from the esophagus.</p>
      <p>At the same time the anesthetic team, noticing 600 ml of fresh blood in the aspirator
of the gastric content started the resuscitation protocol. After laparotomy, another
1800 ml fresh blood was aspirated from the surgical field. There was not an
available cell saver in the operating room. Due to the severity of the
intraoperative incident, together with the scarce reserve of the hospital blood
supplies, the patient received only four units of packed red blood cells and five
units of fresh frozen plasma. The laceration was sutured but the blood losses were
too great and the patient died of hemorrhagic shock, unresponsive to resuscitation
maneuvers.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>Autopsy findings</title>
        <p>On the anterior side of the lower part of the thoracic aorta, near the diaphragm,
an H laceration of about 1.2/1cm was identified, with an irregular contour and
hemorrhagic infiltrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). On the
posterior side of the aorta, corresponding to the anterior lesion, a small
laceration of about 0.2 cm was identified, affecting the intima and partially
the media. In the stomach, a callous ulcer near the pyloric antrum was
identified on the posterior gastric wall, with rounded margins, affecting the
mucosal, submucosal and muscular layer, with a diameter of about 1.5 cm. The
esophagus in the subdiaphragmatic part, near the cardia, had an anfractuous
laceration, affecting all the anatomical layers, with a sutured hemorrhagic
infiltrate.</p>

          <graphic xlink:href="rbccv-30-04-0494-g01"/>
        </fig>
        <p>Histology examination confirmed the laceration, affecting all the layers of the
aortic wall, with small hemorrhagic areas in the media, and abundant
inflammatory reaction with lymphocytes and plasma cells, located around the vasa
vasorum and in the surrounding interstitial tissue. The esophagus contained
numerous, recent hemorrhagic areas mostly located between the adventitial and
muscle layers, with a chronic inflammatory reaction (lymphocytes and plasma
cells) in the muscle and subadventitial layers. The stomach contained an
unspecific gastritis with large ulcero-necrotic areas, abundant chronic
inflammatory reaction in the interstitial and perivascular areas of the
submucosa, muscularis propria, and subserous layers, with immature granular
tissue in the subserous layer and acute inflammatory reaction at the serous
layer (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory associated gastritis). The cause of death
was considered acute hemorrhage (Ia), secondary to an aortic rupture during
bariatric surgery.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Ethics</title>
        <p>The management of ethics related issues was performed in accordance with the
Romanian Law regarding the organization and functioning of the medical legal
system N&#xBA; 1 from 20.01.2000, Art 2(3) and Art 15(e) and Decision No.774/2000
regarding the approval of the methodological norms for the application of the
Law 1/200, Art 39(1), in full compliance with relevant international norms,
including the Declaration of Helsinki. Both surgeries of the presented case were
done in a tertiary surgical department, neither author being involved in the
clinical management.</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="discussion">
      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Band slippage is a relatively frequent postoperative complication of LAGB, with an
overall prevalence of about 5.5%<sup>[<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. If it is confirmed the first step is represented by band
deflation through the subcutaneous port. However, in our case, the presence of
superior digestive hemorrhage suggested the possibility of gastric erosion or
ischemia, suggesting the need for a surgical re-intervention. During revision the
surgeon must be aware that around the band is often encountered a fibrous reaction
that requires careful dissection<sup>[<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Moreover, aorta passes posteriorly of the stomach and
esophagus, in close relation with these structures; therefore the fibrous tissue
developed after bariatric surgery may have had a traction effect upon this
vessel.</p>
      <p>There is no doubt that severe chronic inflammation, with dense adhesions between the
band, the abdominal esophagus, the stomach and the abdominal aorta passing through
its diaphragmatic hiatus played an important role for this major incident. The
characteristics of the aorta rupture suggest iatrogenic lesions during gastric
dissection, most likely done by a sharp object (e.g. scizzors), that could also
explain the presence of the posterior aorta lesion.</p>
      <p>Aortic complications secondary to bariatric surgery have been rarely cited. Gaia
cited a case of ruptured aortic aneurism and an aortic dissection in patients that
underwent a bariatric procedure<sup>[<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>; however they were not caused by the intervention
<italic>per se</italic> or its complications, being most likely associated with
the comorbidities of morbid obesity (atherosclerosis, aortic calcifications, and so
on). This is the first reported case, to our knowledge, of an intraoperative aortic
lesion secondary to a repositioning procedure for a gastric band.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="conclusions">
      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>The morbid obesity surgeries, especially revision surgeries, carry a high morbidity
and even mortality. Only a thorough preoperative planning, a careful operative
technique, and a low threshold for conversion to open surgery may decrease the
failure rate of these surgeries.</p>
