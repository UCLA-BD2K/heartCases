        <p>Cutaneous meningiomas are rare tumors most commonly located on the scalp. We report
the case of a 55-year-old male who presented with a 2x3 cm tumoral lesion on the
forehead. The lesion was hard, adherent and covered by normal skin. Incisional biopsy
revelead a proliferation of monomorphic round cells, organized in nests and focally
forming pseudovascular spaces. Immunohistochemical study revealed positivity for
epithelial antigen membrane and vimentin. Vascular markers, cytokeratins and S100
protein were negative. A brain CT scan did not show any evidence of intracranial
meningioma. The authors describe the case of a cutaneous frontal meningioma in
probable relation with previous cranioencephalic trauma.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Meningioma is the most common tumor of the neuroaxis and is derived from meningothelial
cells. Cutaneous meningiomas are collections of ectopic meningothelial cells in the
dermis and subcutis, occuring most commonly on the scalp. <sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The authors present a case of cutaneous meningioma of the frontal region with an unusual
presentation and which could not be included into any of the classical types described.
The objective of the report is to emphasize the rarity of this entity but also to
increase awareness of its existence, so that clinicians can include it in the
differential diagnosis of unusual scalp lesions.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 55-year-old male presented with a slowly growing asymptomatic tumoral lesion in the
frontal area, which had been evolving for 3 years.</p>
      <p>Physical examination revealed a 2x3 cm, firm, ovoid subcutaneous mass, which was
adherent to the deep tissues and covered by normal skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). There was no evidence of cervical lymphadenopathy on
palpation.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The patient had suffered an occupational injury resulting in head trauma (24 years
earlier) with fracture of the frontal bone and damage to the right brachial plexus. As a
consequence, he developed encephalomalacia, right arm palsy and epilepsy (focal right
frontal paroxysmal activity). In 2007 he suffered another episode of head trauma, which
caused an acute fronto-parietal subdural hematoma. There was history of alcohol abuse.
He was being treated with levetiracetam 1g 2 id, oxazepam 15 mg id and folic acid 5 mg
id.</p>
      <p>A deep biopsy was performed and histological examination showed a proliferation of cells
arranged in nests and lobules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2A</xref>). Some
areas showed an interstitial growth pattern, with collagen dissection, evoking the
formation of vascular spaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2B</xref>). There
was occasional entrapment of hyaline collagen, forming rounded collagen structures, but
no calcification was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2C</xref>). The cells
were round or ovoid, monomorphic, and devoid of mitotic activity or significant
cytological atypia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2D</xref>). The nuclei were
basophilic with finely scattered chromatin and the cytoplasm was moderately abundant,
staining with a pale eosinophilic color.</p>

morphological and immunohistochemical features established the diagnosis of cutaneous

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Because of its rarity, the literature regarding cutaneous meningiomas is mainly based on
case reports.</p>
      <p>In 1974, Lopez et al<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> developed a
classification based on clinical and histopathological criteria. This classification is
still widely used, and divides cutaneous meningiomas into 3 types:</p>
      <p>Type I are congenital lesions, although they are frequently noticed later in life. They
occur on the scalp (occipital area and along the suture lines) and para-vertebral
regions, and derive from meningothelial cells that become trapped in the dermis and
subcutis during development. There may be a connection with the central nervous system
(sinus tract), leading to the assumption that type I meningiomas may represent
rudimentary meningoceles that have not kept their connection to the central nervous
system. <sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Type II meningiomas are acquired lesions that probably develop from ectopic arachnoid
cells that extend to the skin by contiguity, along cranial and spinal nerves. Hence,
they are located around sensory organs (eyes, ears, nose and mouth) and along the course
of cranial and spinal nerves. There is no associated meningioma of the neuroaxis.
<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Type III are intracranial meningeal tumors that involve the skin by direct extension
through bone, traumatic or surgical defects, occurring most commonly on the face, temple
and scalp as slow-growing subcutaneous masses. <sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Due to its rarity and lack of characteristic clinical features (painless subcutaneous
nodules, alopecic areas with tufts of hair or hipertrichosis), the differential
diagnosis is quite broad, including nevus sebaceous, alopecia areata, adnexal tumors,
dermoid cysts, pseudocysts, fibromas, hemangiomas, squamous cell carcinoma, hamartomas,
meningocele, meningomyelocele, nasal glioma, neuroectodermic tumours, metastatic
lesions.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The clinical features and imaging studies are most of the times inconclusive, making
cytology, and most notably histology, crucial for establishing the definitive diagnosis.
The most common histopathogical form is the meningothelial type, with lobules, nests and
sheets of oval/polygonal meningothelial cells, with a whorled arrangement that shows
hyaline structures (<italic>collagen bodies</italic>) or calcification foci
(<italic>psammomma bodies</italic>), which are very helpful clues to the diagnosis.
<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The immunohistochemical features in our patient's lesion are in agreement with other
reported cases: positivity for EMA and vimentin, and negativity for cytokeratins, S100
protein, CD34 and CD31, CD68, desmin and smooth muscle actin. These allow to exclude
epithelial, melanocytic, vascular, histiocytic and myogenic differentation,
respectively. <sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The gold standard treatment is complete surgical excision, although some advocate
conservative treatment if the lesion is asymptomatic and there are no complications.
<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Type I lesions have better prognosis than type II and III. Some type III lesions can be
inoperable, significantly worsening the vital prognosis. Some investigational studies
based on molecular-based targeted therapies such as vascular endothelial growth factor
inhibitors and platelet-derived growth factor inhibitors are being performed. <sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Although our case does not fit neatly into any specific type of cutaneous meningioma, it
is probably best regarded as a variant of a type II lesion. We might speculate that
there may be a relation with the previous head trauma, with presumable extension of
meningeal tissue through the bone structural defect.</p>
      <p>The authors highlight the importance of a detailed clinical history in such cases, which
may contribute to evoke the possibility of cutaneous meningioma in certain clinical
settings. Histopathological examination plays the major role in establishing the
definitive diagnosis, namely through careful assessment of the morphological features
combined with a selected panel of immunohistochemical stains. Finally, imaging studies
are useful to detect associated features (namely a connection to the neuroaxis or a
possible association with an intracranial meningioma), and are of great importance in
planning the correct therapeutic approach in these cases.</p>
