      <abstract>
        <p>The actynomyces infection is a rare cause of chronic pelvic
inflammation, which can be manifested in multiple ways. It is
caused by the actynomyces bacteria, usually by the
<italic>israelii</italic> type, which can be a part of the normal flora of
the genital tract in patients who use intrauterine device (IUD).
There is a discussion about the importance of considering this
infection disease as part of the differential diagnosis in
patients using the IUD, with atypical manifestations and bizarre
presentation of infections of the genital tract, severe pelvic
adherent syndromes, tubo-ovarian complexes (abscesses) barely
symptomatic, and in the case of intraoperatory suspicion of pelvic
carcinomatosis among others.</p>
      </abstract>
    </article-meta>
  </front>
  <body>
    <p>Case 1</p>
    <p>The patient is a 38-year old female. She was admitted to the service for
a scheduled extraction of IUD by hysteroscopy. The patient was
asymptomatic. She has had the IUD for 9 years. During
the hysteroscopy, it was evidenced that the IUD was
perforating the uterine wall at the level of the fundus. There was
visualization of intestinal loops through the defect. The
laparoscopic procedure was converted into a laparotomy due to the
finding of sealed pelvis. The following are the findings from the
exploratory laparotomy: uterine perforation, right adnexal mass in
plastron, left tubo-ovarian complex perforated comprising the
bowel wall at the level of the sigmoid colon, and secondary
peritonitis. Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were
done. A Hartmann hemicolectomy plus drainage of the peritonitis
and lavage of the peritoneal cavity were also done. The
postoperative progress of the patient was adequate with absence of
inflammatory response signs. The patient was discharged home. The
histopathological analysis of the specimen showed infection by
actynomyces comprising the uterus adnexal tissues and with severe
inflammatory process of the uterine wall. Based on the results of
the histopathology, the patient was readmitted to the service for
intravenous antibiotic therapy. She was given crystalline
penicillin 1 000 000 IU per hour by continuous infusion for 15
days. Then, she was discharged home on amoxicillin 2 grams BID, PO
for six months. The patient has been followed up in two occasions
one month apart in the outpatient clinic. The physical examination
was within normal limits and laboratory workup showed no findings
of infection or sepsis.</p>
    <p>Case 2</p>
    <p>The patient is a 23-year old female. She was admitted to the
emergency room with a main complain of three-month
abdominal-pelvic pain associated with the feeling of abdominal
mass in some occasions, subjective fever (not assessed by
thermometer) in multiple occasions, asthenia, adynamia, and weight
loss. As a relevant past medical history, the patient has been
diagnosed with bilateral adnexal masses, which have been followed
up with tumor marker studies that are negative until this date.
The past surgical history is positive for appendectomy and two
c-sections. The contraception method used by the patient for the
last three years was the IUD. When the patient was admitted to the
service she presented a severe abdominal pain. Physical
examination revealed a right adnexal mass of approximated 6
centimeters in diameter that was bounded to the body of the uterus
and was not painful at manipulation. There was also a left adnexal
mass of approximated 10 centimeters of diameter which was painful
at palpation. Based on the findings of suffering left adnexal
mass, the patient was taken to an exploratory laparotomy due to
acute abdomen diagnosis. Intraoperative findings were the
following: severe adhesion syndrome with sealed pelvis, and 3
centimeter diameter cystic mass in the omentum with signs of
ischemia. During the surgical resection there was an incidental
dissection of the intestinal serosa near the tubo-ovarian complex.
Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was done with complete resection
of the plastron and suture of the serosa was also done. Three days
later the patient was readmitted by acute abdomen, she was taken
back to the operation room for a new laparotomy. The findings
during the laparotomy were as follows: generalized peritonitis
secondary to a perforation at the level of the ileum and rectum,
which required management with a colostomy. The histopathological
study was compatible with bilateral tubo-ovarian abscess with
infection by actynomyces. The patient received antibiotic therapy
with crystalline penicillin 24 000 000 IU per day intravenously.
Once the histopathology diagnosis was confirmed the patient
continued therapy with ampicillin for another 6 months.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The actynomyces infection is a chronic infection. It
is caused by the actynomyces organism which is a gram positive
anaerobe. The infection is usually localized around the
cervicofacial area, but it could also be present with
manifestations at the lungs, abdominal, or urogenital levels
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The infection that presents at the pelvic level
corresponds to a 10 to 15% of all reported cases. There is a
higher incidence of the infection in males than females, except in
the abdominal and pelvic localization where the higher incidence
is in females. It has been reported as an incidence of 1 to 16%
of all of the pelvic infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Actynomyces is a rare
cause of chronic infection; it causes local infiltration and
induration of the tissues. Its role as a pathologic entity in the
genital female tract is discussed because its manifestations have
a wide spectrum that includes: asymptomatic infection, chronic
pelvic pain, adnexal mass, tubo-ovarian complex, tumor-like
carcinoma, and pelvic adhesion syndrome. The preoperative
diagnosis is hard to achieve due to the finding of the
microorganism by culture or immunofluorescence studies of vaginal
secretion without being pathologic or any association to abdominal
pain or sepsis. Although the chance of making a precise diagnosis
is very attractive because it could change the therapeutic
options, these facts we must consider: it is a nonmalignant
process; it is a microorganism very sensible to B-lactams
antibiotics; the radical surgery in some cases can be complicated
with dissection of the intestinal and urinary tracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].
Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, the patients should be on
long term therapy with B-lactams antibiotics.</p>
