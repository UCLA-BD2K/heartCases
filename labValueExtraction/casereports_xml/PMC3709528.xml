        <title>SUMMARY</title>
        <p>A pointed, narrow and exaggeratedly upturned nasal tip and concave dorsal profile can give the nose an unnatural and artificial appearance that is the unmistakable hallmark of plastic surgery. As a result of changes in social attitudes, noses that have evidently been operated on are no longer acceptable and requests are made for correction. While a more natural dorsal profile can be obtained with camouflage grafts of autologous cartilage or alloplastic material (EPTFE), autologous grafts alone are used to reconstruct the tip. The most complex correction regards an obtuse nasolabial angle, for which the extension graft technique is used. Particular care must be taken during preoperative planning, where the aid of computer simulation and agreement with the patient are essential.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>"Doctor, I want a nose that looks natural, not one that has obviously been operated on".</p>
      <p>This is the first thing every patient always says today on first meeting a surgeon with a view to rhinoplasty. Ever since the 1990s, both surgeons and patients have in fact developed increasingly sophisticated tastes when considering operative results. As a result of the same evolution, the cute little turned-up nose is no longer considered an aesthetic model by the overwhelming majority of individuals wishing to alter the shape of their nose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01"><sup>1</sup></xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R02"><sup>2</sup></xref>.</p>
      <p>In many cases, the fact that an otherwise by no means unattractive nose that has a "rhinoplastic look" will prompt patients to undergo revision surgery to eliminate or at least attenuate this undesired result.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="S2">
      <title>The rhinoplastic look</title>
      <p>The major characteristics that make a nose look unnatural and artificial after surgery can be identified on the basis of patients' complaints as follows:</p>
      <list list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p>concave dorsal profile;</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p> over-rotation of the tip;</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p> narrow, pointed tip.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <sec id="S2a">
        <title>Concave dorsal profile</title>
        <p>The correction of slight concavity of the nasal dorsum is carried out at the strictly sub-muscular level using a camouflage graft, the selection and creation of which require particular care. The aim is in fact to improve an initial situation that is by no means disastrous, and patients will show little tolerance for errors in estimating the degree of elevation obtained, which falls within a narrow range where 1 or 2 mm can make all the difference. Computer simulation proves very useful indeed in planning these operations and helps to establish the thickness of the graft required for an optimal result in the preoperative stage.</p>
        <p>When available, autologous grafts of septal cartilage can be used as long as they are free from curving and irregularity, whereas cartilage from the auricular concha, which is curved and variable in thickness, is unsuitable for camouflage of the dorsum precisely where the nasal skin is thinnest.</p>
        <p>A valid alternative is the use of EPTFE (Gore-Tex), which is available in sheets of 1 mm in thickness for cutting to shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), and can be applied in two or three layers where necessary. The greatest advantage of EPTFE is its softness, which means that it moulds itself to the shape of the nasal dorsum and is undetectable by touch even in cases where the skin is particularly thin.</p>
        <fig fig-type="Halftone" id="F1" position="float">
          <label>Fig. 1.</label>
          <caption>
            <p>The shape and size of the Gore-Tex (EPTFE) graft are obtained from the outline drawn on the ridge of the nose in methylene blue.</p>

          <graphic xlink:href="0392-100X-33-177-g001"/>
        </fig>
        <p>Where greater thickness is required, it is possible to use a composite graft with autologous cartilage below and a layer of EPTFE on top. While the cartilage provides volume, the Gore-Tex ensures overall uniformity and conceals potentially visible irregularities. The two layers are stitched together with 6-0 nylon before insertion.</p>

        <title>Over-rotation of the nasal tip</title>
        <p>Over-rotation of the tip is frequently caused by excessive resection of the caudal septum, often related to the surgeon's practically unquantifiable view that <italic>"in any case, the tip always drops a little after..."</italic>.</p>
        <p>The correction of over-rotation often presents serious difficulties. If only slight adjustment is required, a Sheen-type shield graft may prove sufficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R03"><sup>3</sup></xref>. If the upper part of the shield shows a tendency to rotate upwards, a buttress graft will provide further support and strengthening to keep it in the desired position <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04"><sup>4</sup></xref>. In the comparatively frequent cases where slight over-rotation is combined with saddle nose, surgeons can also take advantage of the fact that correction of the latter produces an optical effect that makes the tip look less rotated than it actually is. When a greater degree of correction is required, an extension graft <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R05"><sup>5</sup></xref> to reconstruct the missing caudal septum must be used.</p>
        <p>The monolateral or bilateral septal extension graft is sutured (with 6-0 nylon) between the dorsal border of the septum and the upper lateral cartilages. Unlike a spreader graft, it projects beyond the anterior septal angle in proportion to the degree of elongation required. An intercrural graft is secured to the end to serve in the same way as a columellar strut for attachment of the medial crura of the alar cartilages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
        <fig fig-type="Halftone" id="F2" position="float">
          <label>Fig. 2.</label>
          <caption>

          </caption>
          <graphic xlink:href="0392-100X-33-177-g002"/>
        </fig>
        <p>The septal cartilage is the ideal material for these grafts when present in straight and sufficiently long segments.</p>
        <p>In cases where it is not available, there are two alternatives, namely the auricular concha and rib cartilage. The former is, however, insufficient for the purpose to exert caudal pressure on the complex of the alar cartilages and hence the nasal tip due to its curved and insufficiently rigid character. At the same time, using rib cartilage involves an additional scar and makes the operation more invasive. In my experience, insertion of alloplastic materials such as EPTFE or Medpor in a mobile structure like the nasal tip can lead to complications in the form of rejection or extrusion.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="S2c">
        <title>Narrow, pointed tip</title>
        <p>This is nearly always caused by interruption of the domes of the alar cartilages, a technique widely used in the 1960s and 1970s. While giving excellent results when performed by expert surgeons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R06"><sup>6</sup></xref>, in less expert hands this can lead to collapse of the lateral crura of the alar cartilages with both aesthetic and functional consequences, namely a pinched nose with an unnaturally narrow tip and insufficiency of the external nasal valve. The same effects can also be observed when the alar cartilages are not actually cut across the domes, but markedly weakened by excessive resection of their cephalic border.</p>
        <p>The surgeon must seek to restore the continuity of the arch of each alar cartilage by identifying the residual stumps so that they can be joined together again with non-absorbable sutures. Excessively weakened lateral crura must be strengthened with lateral crural onlay grafts or strut grafts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07"><sup>7</sup></xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Where this is not sufficient, the lateral crus must be rebuilt with autologous cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). While septal cartilage can be used for this purpose, cartilage from the concha can also be used, which proves very suitable in this case because its natural convexity recreates the shape of the lateral crura of the alar cartilages.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>In this type of secondary rhinoplasty involving modifications of the dorsum that are only apparently minimal, the margin of error is very broad indeed. One initial difficulty lies precisely in interpreting the patient's wishes correctly. Use of the computer to simulate the result is extremely useful in this regard. It is advisable to decide on the thickness of the dorsal graft before the operation with measurements carried out on the simulated computer image and agreed upon with the patient.</p>
      <p>The use of EPTFE offers undeniable advantages, the first of which is its absolute stability over time without the slightest degree of resorption. Other advantages include availability, solidity and rapidity of use. A recent review<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08"><sup>8</sup></xref> compared complications (specifically: infection, resorption, warping and extrusion) of autologous cartilage from the septum or ear and EPTFE with very similar results: 1.5-5% for cartilage and 1-3% for EPTFE. A minimum rate of extrusion for Gore-Tex is balanced by the absence of resorption.</p>
      <p>A narrow nasal tip, another hallmark of rhinoplasty, often also involves incompetence of the external nasal valve and is hence both an aesthetic and a functional problem. While batten grafts or lateral crural strut grafts are clearly effective in functional terms, a shield graft sutured to the alar cartilages also makes the complex of the tip more compact and thus strengthens the nasal valve. An open approach is particularly indicated in this type of operation, above all for the precision and ease it offers in the positioning of grafts.</p>
