      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The Mirizzi syndrome consists of the obstruction either of the common hepatic duct or
the choledocus, secondary to the extrinsic compression due to the impact of calculus in
the cystic duct or in the gallbladder infundibulum<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The first description is due to Pablo Mirizzi (1948), when he
observed some factors which could cause extra hepatic cholesthasis in certain groups of
patients carrying cholelithiasis<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. It
generally occurs in female with advanced age. Depending on the degree of involvement of
the biliary tract, the patients may be grouped into five distinct groups according to
the new rating of the Mirizzi syndrome<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The goal of this report is to present a case of a patient carrying type IV, surgically
treated through the laparotomy approach.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 56-year-old woman was admitted into the Service of Surgery of Get&#xFA;lio Vargas
Hospital with history of pain in the right hypochondrium with dorsal irradiation, daily
evening fever during three months, and a previous episode of choluria lasting 10 days.
The physical examination of admission was normal; laboratory tests demonstrated
transaminases changes: glutamic oxalacetic transaminase: 75U/L and glutamic pyruvic
transaminase: 62U/L; and the canalicular enzymes: alkaline phosphatase: 1924 U/L, and
gama glutamil transferase: 884 U/L; the bilirubins were normal. The abdomen ultrasound
showed cholelithiasis, bile duct of increased caliber measuring 1.7 cm, showing the
"double barreled" with the portal vein, with presence of hyperechoic image measuring 1.1
cm, compatible with calculus; intra-hepatic biliary tract had normal sonographic
appearance. The magnetic cholangiography showed cholelithiasis with intra and
extra-hepatic biliary tract dilation up to the level of the distal common bile duct,
which measured 1.6 cm.</p>
      <p>The patient underwent surgical procedure through the laparotomy approach with right
subcostal incision. Intraoperatively, there were adhesions of the transverse colon,
duodenum and stomach in the gallbladder, which was found to be scleroatrophic and full
of calculus. It was decided to perform anterograde cholecystectomy (Torek&#xB4;s). During the
procedure, it was observed the presence of fistula between the gallbladder infundibulum
and the choledocus, with erosion of its entire anterior wall covering from the
implantation of the cystic duct to the proximity of the duodenum, which was classified
as type IV Mirizzi. Choledocoscopy through the fistula was performed with flexible
choledocoscope, and a single calculus in the distal choledocus, was identified and
removed. The irrigation of the biliary tract with physiological saline solution without
elimination of aditional calculus, and endside choledocojejunal anastosomosis in
Roux-en-Y was performed with ligature of the distal choledocus. The peritoneal cavity
was drained with latex laminar drain. The diet was released on the second day after
surgery, with good acceptance. The drain debit oscillated between 20 and 755 ml, showing
bilious secretion until the 10<sup>th</sup> day, when it was removed due to the volume
reduction. The patient was discharged on the 12<sup>th</sup> day after surgery.</p>

    <sec sec-type="discussion">
      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Mirizzi syndrome is a rare complication and it occurs approximately on 0.5 to 4% of the
patients carrying cholelithiasis. It's more frequent on women between 21 to 90 years
old, probably a reflection of the gallstones preponderance in this group. It is the
complication of long standing cholecistolithiasis<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The constant compression of the calculus associated to the inflammation of the involved
structures may result in fistula between the gallbladder infundibulum or the cystic
duct, and the extra hepatic biliary tract. In the cholecystobiliary fistula, the
calculus may migrate to the main biliary tract, while in the coloentericystic fistula
the patient may show intestinal obstruction called biliary ileus<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The importance of the recognition the Mirizzi syndrome derives from the high risk of
lesions of the biliary duct during the surgical procedures. Summing up to this fact is
the difficulty for the preoperative diagnosis because there is no specific clinic and
laboratory presentation<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. The most frequent signs and symptoms are abdominal pain followed by
jaundice and cholangitis. Nausea, vomits, choluria, itch, hepatomegaly and, less
frequently, acute pancreatitis, gallbladder perforation and weight loss<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The Mirizzi syndrome, which was previously classified into four types, currently the
coloentericystic fistula is being included in as complication (type V)<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure
1</xref>). The types are: I) extrinsic compression of the common/choledocus hepatic
duct by calculus in the gallbladder infundibulum or cystic duct; II) presence of
cholecystoenteric biliary fistula with erosion of the diameter less than 1/3 of the
common/choledocus hepatic duct circumference; III) presence of cholecystoenteric biliary
fistula with a diameter bigger than 2/3 of the common/choledocus hepatic duct
circumference; IV) presence of cholecystoenteric biliary fistula involving the entire
common/choledocus hepatic duct circumference; V) any type, plus cholecystoenteric
biliary fistula (Va - without biliary ileus, and Vb - with biliary ileus).</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The surgical treatment of the Mirizzi syndrome requires ability and care in the
dissection of the biliary tract in order to perform the cholecystectomy, a safe
operation of the biliary tract can be avoided and the removal of the calculus so can
avoid any iatrogeny in the biliary tract, as in this particular case, where was opted to
dissect the biliary tract incompletely through the Torek technique due to the intense
inflammatory process<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Intraoperatively, perivisceral firm adhesions is found, the gallbladder in most of the
cases is scleroatrophic, with or without cholecystoenteric fistula, the Calot's fibrous
triangle should arouse the suspicion of this entity. The cholangiography performed by
puncture or by Kehr drain as the first procedure is mandatory so that can outline the
anatomy of the biliary tract <sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Some authors do not consider laparoscopy as first option due to the intense inflammatory
process caused by the disease, being even considered a contraindication to the treatment
minimally invasive, but it can be safely performed by experienced surgeons in some
cases<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>In the absence of cholecystobiliary fistula (Type I), the cholecystectomy and the
removal of the biliary calculus constitute the treatment of choice. In the presence of
lithiasis of common biliary duct, and when the choledocostomy shows technical
difficulties, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the postoperative with
the removal of the calculus may be a safe alternative<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>In types II and III, the dissection of the cystic duct and the exposure of the Calot
triangle may lead to the opening a fistulous orifice in the common biliary duct. In such
situation, one of the alternatives is to use technique on which partial cholecystectomy
is performed through anterograde via with preservation of the infundibulum, followed by
opening of the gallbladder, removal of the calculus of its interior, and choledocoplasty
with suture of the fistulous orifice on the remaining wall of the gallbladder. The Kehr
drain is introduced into the common hepatic duct over the repair site. The closing of
the orifice must be made with no tension and with the stump mucosal of the gallbladder
juxtaposed to the duct mucosal. The use of the gallbladder infundibulum to close the
orifice of the common hepatic duct is good because it consists of vascular tissue and it
has mucosal similar to biliary duct. However, there is a tendency for the formation of
fibrosis and stenosis on the suture lines of the biliary duct, even when it is carefully
performed<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
      <fig id="f02" orientation="portrait" position="float">
        <label>FIGURE 2</label>

          <p>Outline representation of a choledocoplasty and Kehr drain placing<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>
        </caption>
        <graphic xlink:href="abcd-27-03-0226-g02"/>
      </fig>
      <p>If the fistula cannot be primarily corrected with the techniques stated above, the
biliodigestive anastomosis can be performed. For the reconstruction of the biliary duct
in the Mirizzi syndrome type IV, a choledochal and hepaticojejunal anastomosis in
Roux-en-Y is usually necessary as a first act, as in the case of the patient here
reported<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. According Mirizzi classification, there is a well
defined protocol of surgical treatment for different types: type I - partial
cholecystectomy; type II - closing of the fistula with suture or choledocoplasty; type
III - choledocoplasty; type IV - biliodigestive anastomosis. The biliodigestive
anastomosis has been performed for some of the cases of type II when the erosion of the
biliary duct was considered significative<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The organs that can be involved in the cholecystoenteric fistula are the stomach, the
duodenum and the colon. The choosing procedure for the cholecystoenteric fistula with
biliary ileus is the enterolithotomy and the closing of the fistula, and the one for the
fistula without biliary ileus is the closing of the fistula orifice.</p>
