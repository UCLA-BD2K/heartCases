      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Sclerocornea is a rare form of congenital corneal opacity characterized by bilateral scleralization of the cornea. The disease is due to the disorganized migration of fetal neural crest cells between the corneal epithelium and the endothelium.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> The cases are either 50% autosomal recessive or dominant, while the remaining cases are sporadic.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Sometimes, sclerocornea is combined with systemic abnormalities such as mental retardation, hearing defect, and craniofacial abnormalities.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> While among them includes the rarely seen posterior fossa malformationshemangiomas-arterial anomalies-cardiac defects-eye abnormalities-sternal cleft and supraumbilical raphe (PHACES) syndrome.</p>
      <p>The manifestations of PHACES syndrome includes posterior fossa malformations, hemangioma, sternal defect, coarctation of the aorta, as well as anomalies of arteries, hearts, and eyes.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Ophthalmic abnormalities are seen in 16% of the patients with PHACES,<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> which includes Horner syndrome, exophthalmos, strabismus, sclerocornea, iris hydroplasia, glaucoma, congenital cataract, lens coloboma, optic nerve atrophy, retinal vascular abnormality, choroidal hemangiomas, and peripheral staphyloma.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Sclerocornera, an eye abnormality seen in PHACES, is a primary anomaly with scleralization of the peripheral part of cornea, presenting obscured boundary between sclera and cornea. Other abnormalities which involves the entire corneal tissue is called sclerocornea totalis.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> However, similar in other congenital corneal opacities, penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) is indicated in sclerocornea if involvement is bilateral.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup></p>
      <p>The patient in this case report of presumed PHACES syndrome with multiple congenital anomalies had bilateral total sclerocornea. The effort was made to preserve the limbus before performing PKP because the cornea was small and irregular. According to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of using special technique to salvage limbus before performing PKP. The graft remained clear without pannas ingrowth for 6 years, therefore the limbal stem cell deficiency did not occur, justifying the application of this technique.</p>

      <title>Presenting concerns</title>
      <p>A 12-year-old boy with clouding of bilateral corneas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A) since birth had hemangioma over the trunk and extremities, ectopic kidney, patent ductus arteriosus, tethered cord syndrome, communicating-type hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, leg length discrepancy, and flat feet according to his medical history. By judging from the skin, eye (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B) and coarctation of the aorta (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C), he was therefore, diagnosed as a case with PHACES syndrome.</p>

        <title>Clinical findings/diagnostic focus and assessment</title>
        <p>As for the ocular examination, it revealed bilateral total corneal opaque, blending of cornea with sclera, and superficial vascularization. His visual acuity was counting fingers less than 1&#x200A;m in both eyes. However, while there was no clear view of anterior chamber in right eye due to total opacity of cornea; aniridia, irregular pupil, markedly opaque cornea, and cataract of left eye were found under slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Furthermore, intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured as 29&#x200A;mm Hg in right eye and 24&#x200A;mm Hg in left eye, yet the light perception and color sensation were intact bilaterally. B-scan ultrasonography presented normal structure in posterior pole of both eyes without vitreoretinal pathology. First, to improve his vision, we decided to perform PKP in the left eye.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <label>2.2</label>
        <title>Therapeutic focus and assessment</title>
        <p>The operation was performed under general anesthesia. In order to control the IOP in advance, antiglaucoma agents including Latanoprost eye-drop every night in the bedtime, Timolol eye-drop twice daily and intravenous 20% <sc>d</sc>-mannitol 180&#x200A;mL for once were given preoperatively. The cornea was oval and measured 6.5&#x200A;mm vertically and 10.0&#x200A;mm horizontally in diameter. The horizontal diameter of the cornea is appropriate for a 6.0&#x200A;mm trephine, but the trephine may inevitably cut the limbus at 12 and 6 o&#x2019;clock. During trephination, to avoid inadvertently excising the limbus, a 6.0&#x200A;mm circle was demarcated by a marking pen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D). Then the 5 to 7 o&#x2019;clock limbus was recessed for 1.6&#x200A;mm by lamellar dissection, followed by posterior placement of limbal tissue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E, white arrow). The excessive bulbar conjunctiva was excised, and the graft was sutured with 8-0 vicryl sutures. The limbal defect created will then interfere with the suction of vacuum trephine, therefore, to overcome this, the crescent-shaped peripheral donor cornea was sutured to the defect with 10-0 nylon sutures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>F, black arrow heads). This step can be omitted if hand-held punch is used instead. Afterwards, a 6.0&#x200A;mm Barron vacuum trephine was used to punch the central cornea. After excising the cornea, total absence of the iris was noted, and the lens was opaque and membranous (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>G). The lens material was removed meticulously by aspiration, and the posterior capsule was left intact. A 6.5&#x200A;mm donor cornea was sutured with 16 stitches of interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>H). Postoperatively, dexamethasone 1&#x200A;mg/mL per hour, 0.2% ciprofloxacin 4 times a day, and Tobradex ointment (Alcon) twice a day were given.</p>

        <title>Follow-up and outcomes</title>
        <p>The preoperatively elevated IOP, which was commonly found among sclerocornea,<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> returned to normal range after PKP, suggesting that previous IOP measurement might be falsely high due to originally thicken and rigid cornea. The best-corrected vision improved to 20/400 postoperatively, while suboptimal visual acuity might be attributed to preexisting amblyopia. The graft remained its clarity for over 6 years (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>I). The optic nerve head remained normal, without cupping enlargement. The patient received similar surgery for the right eye cornea a year later, but the graft failed with edematous change three years after surgery. Interventions from patient's initial visit were illustrated with timeline (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). As the vision stayed still within counting fingers range, the patient declined advice of regrafting the right eye cornea. Since pannas invasion never happened in both eyes, we assumed that PKP-induced limbal stem cell deficiency never occurred to this patient.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Sclerocornea is a relatively uncommon cause of congenital corneal opacity. It is characterized by a flattened cornea with varying degrees of corneal opacification, which resembles sclera in appearance. The earlier surgical outcome was poor due to vascularization of peripheral cornea, smaller recipient cornea sizes<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> and glaucoma<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> but because the eyes were not always associated with glaucoma, PKP was performed successfully to some patients with sclerocornea.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> In this case of presumed PHACES syndrome, whose cornea is oval-shaped and scleralized, a novel technique was adopted to preserve this patient's limbus. Since without doing so, a 6.0-mm-sized PKP trephine may accidentally remove part of the limbus, not only would it induce partial limbal deficiency, but it may also jeopardize the donor cornea survival, resulting in graft failure due to close contact with limbal vasculature.</p>
      <p>Moreover, to clarify the corneal structure in sclerocornea, there were several reports emphasizing the ultrastructure of sclerocornea by light microscopy,<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> electron microscopy,<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> and ultrasound biomicroscopy.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> In regards to histopathology, the authors concluded that the architecture of the anterior scleralized cornea resembled sclera, with disorganized stroma and vascularization, abnormal Bowman layer, abnormal Descemet membrane and endothelium. However, Young et al found that through the study of proteoglycan content in sclerocornea, scleralized cornea expresses highly sulfated keratan sulfate proteoglycans in pattern, which can be found in cornea rather than in sclera. The above findings proved that sclerocornea is a congenital dysgenesis with failure of corneal type. In other words, sclerocornea resembles cornea rather than sclera.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> In addition, more supporting evidence indicated that the majority of stromal collagen in the scleralized cornea is type I collagen, similar to normal cornea instead of sclera, which is predominantly type III collagen. The lumican content in the scleralized cornea is reduced, while that of aggrecan is increased.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup></p>
      <p>In previous studies, it remained unclear whether the epithelium of scleralized cornea is corneal or conjunctival in phenotype. Recently, using immunoconfocal microscopy to examine the expression of keratin 3, 12, 13, and 19 as well as goblet cell mucin MUC5AC in scleralized corneas, we found positive K3/12, negative K13/19, and MUC5AC staining in these corneas, indicating that the scleralized cornea preserves the corneal but not the conjunctival epithelial phenotype.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Thus, following keratoplasty, normal corneal epithelium can repopulate the corneal surface, and the risk of conjunctivalization is minimal. Though, rejection and glaucoma due to the presence of stromal blood vessels and abnormal iris-anterior chamber structures are more commonly encountered after operation. Therefore, close follow-ups and meticulous caring of the patient is essential.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we reported a technique to avoid damaging the limbus during PKP in a case of presumed PHACES syndrome with total sclerocornea. There were no signs of limbal stem cell deficiency occurrence for more than 6 years postoperatively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>I), justifying that the application of this technique is effective. Still, such technique might also be useful for small and irregular opacity caused by other corneal pathologies.</p>
