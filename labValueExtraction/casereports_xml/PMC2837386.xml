      <abstract>
        <p>We investigated eight families with a novel subtype of congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL4) of whom five members had died from sudden cardiac death during their teenage years. ECG studies revealed features of long-QT syndrome, bradycardia, as well as supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias. Further symptoms comprised myopathy with muscle rippling, skeletal as well as smooth-muscle hypertrophy, leading to impaired gastrointestinal motility and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in some children. Additionally, we found impaired bone formation with osteopenia, osteoporosis, and atlanto-axial instability. Homozygosity mapping located the gene within 2 Mbp on chromosome 17. Prioritization of 74 candidate genes with <italic>GeneDistiller</italic> for high expression in muscle and adipocytes suggested <italic>PTRF-CAVIN</italic> (Polymerase I and transcript release factor/Cavin) as the most probable candidate leading to the detection of homozygous mutations (c.160delG, c.362dupT). PTRF-CAVIN is essential for caveolae biogenesis. These cholesterol-rich plasmalemmal vesicles are involved in signal-transduction and vesicular trafficking and reside primarily on adipocytes, myocytes, and osteoblasts. Absence of PTRF-CAVIN did not influence abundance of its binding partner caveolin-1 and caveolin-3. In patient fibroblasts, however, caveolin-1 failed to localize toward the cell surface and electron microscopy revealed reduction of caveolae to less than 3%. Transfection of full-length PTRF-CAVIN reestablished the presence of caveolae. The loss of caveolae was confirmed by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) in combination with fluorescent imaging. PTRF-CAVIN deficiency thus presents the phenotypic spectrum caused by a quintessential lack of functional caveolae.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Patients with generalized lipodystrophy have a marked lack of body fat. Several gene defects have been described that impede fat synthesis and maturation of fat cells. Here we report on mutations in a novel gene, called <italic>PTRF-CAVIN</italic>, causing congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 4 (CGL4) that is additionally associated with muscle disease. Patients' muscles are large but weak and show an involuntary, rolling contraction pattern called &#x201C;rippling.&#x201D; Further symptoms comprise life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and a disorder of bone formation. We searched for shared segments in the genome of seven patients and found the responsible gene, called <italic>PTRF-CAVIN,</italic> on chromosome 17. This gene is crucial for caveolae (latin for &#x201C;small caves&#x201D;) formation. These small indentations of the cell membrane are found on the surface of muscle, bone, fat, and immune cells and facilitate cell-to-cell communication and the absorption of substances from the extracellular space. Patients lack more than 97% of caveolae and artificial insertion of the correct gene into patient skin cells led to the reappearance of caveolae. As cardiac arrhythmia is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition, patients with CGL4 should be closely monitored by ECG and, if necessary, fitted with an implanted pacemaker and cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) device.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Congenital generalized lipodystrophies (CGL1-3, Berardinelli-Seip syndrome, MIM 608594, 269700, 612526) are autosomal recessive disorders characterized by almost complete absence of body fat associated with dyslipidemia and insulin resistance <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Garg1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000874-Garg2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The discovery of different CGL-related gene defects confirmed its genetic heterogeneity and shed new light on adipocyte function. Causative mutations were found in an adipocyte differentiation factor (Seipin, <italic>BSCL2</italic>) <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Magre1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, in an enzyme of the triglyceride and glycerophospholipid biosynthetic pathway (<italic>AGPAT2</italic>) <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Agarwal1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, and in a lipid-binding protein essential for the formation of caveolae on adipocytes (<italic>CAV1</italic>) <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000874-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Based on the clinical phenotype and genotyping results of patients from consanguineous Omani families, Rajab <italic>et al.</italic> delineated a novel, genetically distinct CGL-subtype (CGL4) <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Rajab1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000874-Heathcote1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In contrast to the &#x201C;classic&#x201D; variants, symptoms were more widespread comprising myopathy, smooth and skeletal muscle hypertrophy, cardiac arrhythmias, osteopenia and distal metaphyseal deformation with joint stiffness. These peculiarities suggested an associated problem both with myocyte growth/function and bone formation. A recent report on two siblings with generalized lipodystrophy, muscle weakness and cervical instability also reminded us of this phenotype <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Simha1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we report on the clinical and genetic evaluation of patients and their family members with CGL4 from Oman (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;10) and the UK (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;1) and describe the discovery of mutations in the gene <italic>PTRF-CAVIN</italic> (Polymerase I and transcript release factor/Cavin) which is an essential factor for the biogenesis of caveolae.</p>

          <title>Family I</title>
          <p>The now 14-year-old boy (FI:201, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g001">Figure 1E</xref>) was born to first degree cousins from Oman. His sister is healthy. After birth he presented with paucity of subcutaneous fat, increased amount of body hair, a protruding abdomen and a large tongue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Congenital hypothyroidism was excluded. At 6 weeks a hypertrophic pyloric stenosis was treated by pyloromyotomy. He had poor appetite and failure to thrive, with weight 3SD below the mean. He had episodic hot flushes and <italic>cutis marmorata</italic> and suffered from frequent staphylococcal skin infections and severe pneumonias. At 10 years of age investigation of frequent palpitations and syncopes revealed both ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles alternating with sinus bradycardia and post-tachycardic pauses of up to 2.2 sec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). A corrected QT-time (QTc with Bazett's correction) between 450&#x2013;480 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and T-wave abnormalities (alternating in V2,V3 and notched in V4) indicate an intermediate to high probability of long-QT syndrome <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Crotti1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Around the same time he had difficulties swallowing and a barium study revealed esophageal dysmotility. Presently, at 14 years of age, he often feels tired, weak, cannot walk for more than one kilometer and complains of back pain and joint stiffness. His mental development is normal, and he is a very good pupil. He has mild splenomegaly, a liver size at the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile with normal echogenicity on ultrasound but elevated transaminases (AST 120 U/l; N&lt;23 and ALT 76 U/I; N&lt;29). His bone phenotype comprises osteopenia with enlarged epiphyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), a bone age retarded by 1.5 years, finger contractures with ulnar deviation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g001">Figure 1G</xref>), spinal rigidity and a prominent hyperlordosis. Skin fold thickness was measured with a Holtain-T/W-Skinfold-Caliper (Holtain, Crymych, UK) over the triceps (2.5 mm); biceps (2.9 mm), subscapular region (3.6 mm), and iliac crest (2.8 mm) yielding 6.1% whole body fat (&lt;3<sup>rd</sup> percentile) <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Slaughter1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Muscular hypertrophy, especially of the thighs, is associated with limb girdle weakness. &#x201C;Mounding&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) and <bold>P</bold>ercussion <bold>I</bold>nduced <bold>R</bold>apid <bold>C</bold>ontractions (PIRCs) can be elicited from all larger muscles. These events are silent on EMG thus excluding myotonia. Serum investigations revealed elevated creatine kinase levels (1,898 IU/l; N&lt;169), dyslipidemia with <italic>elevated</italic> serum triglycerides (2.29 mmol/l; N 0.57&#x2013;1.71), pre-&#x3B2;-lipoproteins (VLDL 39%; N&lt;30) and <italic>reduced</italic> HDL-cholesterol (0.47 mmol/l; N&gt;0.96), apolipoprotein A1 (0.72 g/l; N 1.00&#x2013;1.50) and B (0.6 g/l; N 0.7&#x2013;1.2). Serum leptin levels were reduced (0.9 &#xB5;g/l; N 2.4&#x2013;24.4, reference range for adult individuals with a BMI below the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile). Insulin resistance was increased with a HOMA-IR index of 3.2 (N 0.97&#x2013;2.27) without any signs of <italic>acanthosis nigricans</italic>. Fasting glucose was 5.9 mmol/l and rose to 8.6 mmol/l (insulin 960 pmol/l) two hours after a standard glucose tolerance test with 1.75 g/kg BW <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Sinha1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>

          <title>Family II</title>
          <p>The girl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) was born to healthy first degree cousins (FII:201, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) from the UK. She showed neonatal hypotonia and elevated serum creatine kinase levels (1,300 IU/l). Her appetite in early childhood was poor. At 2 years of age her weight was between the 3<sup>rd</sup>&#x2013;10<sup>th</sup> percentile with normal height. Lack of subcutaneous fat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g003">Figure 3F</xref>) and pronounced muscle bulk led to the diagnosis of lipodystrophy. She complained of stiff legs, neck flexor weakness, dizziness and involuntary muscle movements, which were later diagnosed as rippling muscle disease. Her cognitive functions were normal. At 7 years of age she experienced periodic episodes of headache, abdominal pain, constipation and vomiting. At 10 years of age she developed proximal muscle weakness and had problems climbing stairs. Muscle stiffness, exercise-induced myalgia, PIRCs and spontaneous muscle rippling progressed over the next two years, without any evidence of myotonia. Cardiac loop recording after two syncopes revealed sinus arrhythmia, supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias and ventricular extrasystoles. The corrected QT-time was between 430&#x2013;501 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). At 12 years of age, an acute ileus after appendectomy required a partial bowel resection and histology of the colon wall revealed massive smooth muscle hypertrophy. She suffered from frequent infections (tonsillitis) from which she was slow to recover. Atlanto-axial instability with subluxation was verified by X-ray (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>) as well as magnetic resonance imaging and a DEXA-scan revealed severe osteoporosis (Z-score -5.7) and a total whole body fat of 9.7%. At 12 years of age her symptoms were accompanied by hepatomegaly with elevated transaminases (ALT 128 U/l, AST 105 U/l) and signs of fatty infiltration on ultrasound, elevated C-peptide (2,569 pmol/l; N 190&#x2013;990) and insulin levels (331 pmol/l) at a fasting glucose of 5.8 mmol/l. Insulin resistance was considerably increased with HOMA-IR indices ranging between 5.4 and 11.8 without evidence of <italic>acanthosis nigricans</italic>. A glucose tolerance test showed a fasting glucose of 5.6 mmol/l and elevated glucose (8.0 mmol/l) and insulin levels (1,241 pmol/l) two hours after glucose administration. Dyslipidemia was present with <italic>elevated</italic> triglycerides (3.7&#x2013;8.5 mmol/l), an abnormal cholesterol profile (HDL 0.4&#x2013;0.7 mmol/l, LDL 2.1&#x2013;2.3 mmol/l) and reduced apolipoprotein A1 (0.53&#x2013;0.81 g/l). Serum leptin levels (between &lt;0.1 to 0.2 &#xB5;g/l) were below normal. At the age of 13 years the patient collapsed while playing and died from sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation, which was still seen in the ambulance but impossible to cardiovert.</p>

        <title>Absence of PTRF-CAVIN protein from patient cells and tissue</title>
        <p>To verify the absence of PTRF-CAVIN at the protein level we performed a Western blot with protein-extracts from patient fibroblasts (FI:201) and skeletal muscle (FII:201) and probed it with anti-caveolin-1 and anti-PTRF antibodies. PTRF-CAVIN protein was completely absent from fibroblasts and skeletal muscle, whereas the caveolin-1 and caveolin-3 abundance was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g004">Figure 4D and 4G</xref>). Immunohistochemistry of patient muscle showed absence of PTRF-CAVIN from the smooth muscle layer of the intramuscular small vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g005">Figure 5</xref>). As caveolae are particularly abundant on adipocyte membranes <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Aboulaich1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, we searched for fat cells in the muscle of patient FII:201 and found complete absence of caveolin-1 immunoreactivity from the adipocyte cell membranes (red arrowheads on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g005">Figure 5</xref>). As caveolin-1 is essential for lipolysis, lipid droplet formation and lipoprotein metabolism <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Frank1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and patients with <italic>CAV1</italic> mutations suffer from lipodystrophy <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> we thus show that a severe reduction of caveolae <italic>per se</italic> may lead to a similar adipose tissue phenotype.

        <title>Severe reduction of caveolar numbers</title>
        <p>We used caveolin-1 immunoreactivity as a marker for caveolae on the fibroblast surfaces. Control fibroblasts showed a punctate staining pattern at the cell periphery that dissolved in the absence of PTRF-CAVIN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g007">Figure 7E and 7F</xref>) while the perinuclear caveolin-1 staining within the Golgi-apparatus remained unchanged. As caveolin-1 was present in patient fibroblasts in normal quantities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) lack of PTRF-CAVIN seems to disable recruitment of caveolin-1 into the caveolar microdomains of the outer cell membrane. However, transfection of a construct into patient fibroblasts, which contained the full-length, wild-type <italic>PTRF-CAVIN</italic> gene cloned downstream of the eukaryotic CMV-promoter, reconstituted the punctate staining pattern at the cell periphery that corresponds to the caveolae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g006">Figure 6E&#x2013;6G</xref>). Morphometric analysis by transmission electron microscopy of the quantity of caveolae on the cell surface revealed a severe reduction by &gt;97% in the patient's fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>). Complementary to this technique we employed medium and high resolution Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to study the cell surface of native and mildly fixated cells from patient and control. This revealed a comparatively smooth cell surface in the patient with only occasional indentations of 50&#x2013;100 nm corresponding to caveolae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g007">Figure 7C and 7D</xref>). In the patient, overlay between AFM and confocal images revealed the absence of the punctate caveolin-1 staining at the cell surface especially within the major indentations of the fibroblast cell membrane. Instead, the caveolin-3 immunoreactivity was diffusely distributed within the cytoplasm. As expected, PTRF-CAVIN immunoreactivity was entirely absent from the cell surface of patient fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g007">Figure 7H</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we describe eleven patients with mutations in a gene that encodes PTRF-CAVIN, which is essential for the biogenesis of caveolae. Thus the multi-facetted symptoms of our patients combine the features seen in individuals with mutations in caveolin-1 (lipodystrophy) and in caveolin-3 (myopathy). While drafting our report, we became aware of similar work by Hayashi <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1000874-Hayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Using a complementary candidate gene approach they had identified <italic>PTRF-CAVIN</italic> mutations in five Japanese patients with lipodystrophy and myopathy with muscular hypertrophy. The cardiac and bone phenotype was not described in detail. All their patients harbored the p.K233fs mutation, four in homozygous state and a fifth patient as compound heterozygote together with a p.E176fs mutation. Those mutant proteins failed to localize to the cell membrane, however, re-emergence of caveolae after transfection of patient cells with a full-length rescue plasmid was not examined. In muscle, contrary to our results, they found a secondary reduction of caveolin-3 on Western blot. Parallel to our findings from patient fibroblasts, they also found a severe reduction of caveolae on electron microscopic images of patient muscle. This further strengthens the assumption that PTRF-CAVIN deficiency presents the phenotypic spectrum caused by generalized impairment of caveolae biogenesis.</p>
      <p>In addition to the &#x201C;classic&#x201D; methods of transmission electron microscopy we here demonstrate the feasibility of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) in combination with immunofluorescent imaging to visualize the pathological changes brought about by an inherited defect of caveolae biogenesis. This method provides high-resolution images from the cellular surface without the need for dehydration and extensive fixation of the cells. It can even be used for live-cell imaging and may be a potential tool for real-time imaging of caveolar dynamics in the future <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <sec id="s3a">
        <title>Multiple caveolar dysfunctions may explain patient symptoms beyond lipodystrophy</title>
        <p>
<italic>PTRF-CAVIN</italic> is expressed in many tissues but highest mRNA-levels are found in adipocytes, muscle (smooth, heart, and skeletal), osteoblasts, but not in neuronal tissue (BioGPS, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biogps.gnf.org/">http://biogps.gnf.org/</ext-link>). Hence its expression pattern is congruent with the multi-system disorder seen in our patients that spares the nervous system.</p>
        <p>In addition to lipodystrophy, most patients showed signs of smooth muscle hypertrophy in the gastrointestinal tract leading to dysmotility, dysphagia, ileus and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS). Presently the genetic basis of IHPS is unknown, although several susceptibility loci have been discovered, with the Nitrate Oxide Synthase type 1 (<italic>NOS1,</italic> syn. <italic>nNOS</italic>) locus amongst them and a <italic>NOS1</italic>-knockout mouse showing a gastric outlet obstruction <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. As NOS1 co-localizes with caveolin-1 <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Sato1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and caveolin-3 <xref rid="pgen.1000874-GarciaCardena1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, we investigated the patient muscle with anti-NOS1 antibodies, and found an increased sub-sarcolemmal immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000874-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This finding is in accord with the data of Hayashi <italic>et al.</italic> who also found an overexpression of NOS1 in two muscle samples of their patients <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Hayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> as well as with results from myopathic mice with transgenic expression of mutant p.P104L caveolin-3 <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Sunada1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. These findings make it unlikely that PTRF-CAVIN-deficiency acts via NOS1 depletion to cause IHPS.</p>
        <p>Various cardiac ion channels, especially the nodal pacemaker channel HCN4 (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel 4), the voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup>-channel (Na<sub>v</sub>1.5, <italic>SCN5A</italic>), which is important for excitability and propagation of cardiac depolarization waves, and the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels (<italic>CACNA1C</italic>) necessary for excitation-contraction coupling <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Lhn1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, are closely associated with caveolae and caveolin-3 (<italic>CAV3</italic>) immunoreactivity. Mutations of <italic>SCN5A, CACNA1C</italic> and <italic>CAV3</italic> are associated with ventricular tachycardia, long-QT syndromes (LQT3,8,9), and sudden cardiac death while mutations of <italic>HCN4</italic> cause sick sinus syndrome type 2 <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Balijepalli1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Patients FI:201 and FII:201 showed features of both arrhythmias and additionally of LQT-syndrome, which we assume may be due to the simultaneous functional dissociation of all those ion channels that are functionally dependent on caveolae. Clearly, more functional and immune electron microscopic studies of cardiomyocytes are needed to verify the effect of PTRF-CAVIN on receptor clustering and function.</p>
        <p>The muscle weakness of our patients resembled the pattern seen in limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 1C (LGMD1C) and rippling muscle disease (RMD), which are caused by dominant-negative mutations in <italic>CAV3</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1000874-Betz1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. &#x201C;Rippling&#x201D; denotes rolling and sometimes painful muscle contractions which are not caused by sarcolemmal depolarization and thus silent on EMG <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Vorgerd1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. One theory implicates the propagation of action potentials inside the muscle fiber through a malformed longitudinal tubular system <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Lamb1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Disruption of the T-tubular system in the absence of PTRF-CAVIN seems to be likely, because alteration of <italic>PTRF-CAVIN</italic> mRNA-levels considerably influenced tubular morphology <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Regarding the increased susceptibility of both patients to bacterial infections, it is noteworthy that caveolae have been found on stimulated B-lymphocytes (plasma cells) and that murine <italic>Cav1</italic>
<sup>-/-</sup> B-lymphocytes showed reduced <italic>in vitro</italic> IgG<sub>3</sub>-secretion after LPS-stimulation <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Medina1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. These findings support the assumption that the structural integrity of caveolae is needed for a regular humoral immune reaction.</p>
        <p>Finally, caveolae are abundantly present on osteoblasts and are involved in the regulation of alkaline phosphate transcription and protein activity <italic>via</italic> the bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) signaling pathway <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Hartung1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, while caveolin-1 has a role in bone matrix calcification <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Sawada1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Disruption of both functions through absence of caveolae might be the cause for abnormal bone growth (osteopenia), reduced matrix calcification (osteoporosis) and reduced stability of the vertebrae and their ligaments (atlanto-axial instability) in our patients.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the diverse clinical spectrum of PTRF-CAVIN deficiency displays the consequences of a quintessential lack of functional caveolae. We have shown that the spectrum mirrors the expression pattern of the gene and the distribution of caveolar functions according to current knowledge. The presence of generalized lipodystrophy in combination with muscle rippling/mounding, intestinal obstruction and the absence of <italic>acanthosis nigricans</italic> should let geneticists think of PTRF-CAVIN deficiency.</p>
        <p>Taken together, these features clearly delineate CGL4-patients from individuals with <italic>BSCL2</italic>, <italic>AGPAT2</italic>, and <italic>CAV1</italic> mutations <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Garg2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Clinicians should be alerted to perform detailed cardiac investigations to search for potentially serious arrhythmias and, if positive, consider the application of an implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) device.</p>

Briefly, cells were grown on uncoated round glass cover slips in DMEM (+15% FCS) in 2 cm diameter plastic dishes to near confluence. After rinsing with PBS, cells were fixed in Na-cacodylate-buffered 2.5% glutaraldehyde (pH 7.3) containing 1 mg/ml ruthenium red (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) for 12 h at room temperature. Ruthenium red labels the cell surface only. Other staining protocols with OsO<sub>4</sub>, uranylacetate or leadcitrate were omitted. The cell monolayer was embedded in Epon resin <italic>in situ</italic> and the cover slips were removed by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. 70 nm sections were cut parallel to the culture substratum from the base of the cells with a microtome (Reichert Ultracut, Vienna, Austria) using a diamond knife and placed on Formvar-coated copper grids. Microscopic images were recorded with a Zeiss E905 transmission electron microscope. For quantification of the results, we counted the number of caveolae along the length of a total of 50 &#xB5;m cell membrane in random samples.

        <p>Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) visualizes the surface membrane topography in living or only mildly fixated cells with a resolution in the nanometer range <xref rid="pgen.1000874-Lucius1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. As opposed to scanning electron microscopy, dehydration of the samples is unnecessary, which allows simultaneous labeling with fluorescent antibodies, thus providing a powerful tool to see disease-specific changes on cell surfaces. Fibroblasts were cultured on glass bottom dishes (WillCo Wells BV, Amsterdam, Netherlands). After cells had attached and flattened, they were fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min at room temperature, followed by a 3&#xD7;5 min wash in PBS. Cells were labeled with anti-caveolin-1 and anti-PTRF antibodies and subsequently with appropriate secondary fluorescent antibodies. AFM measurements were carried out with NanoWizard II (JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany) combined with a Leica Optical Microscope DMI6000B equipped with a DFC360FX CCD camera (Leica Microsystems). The calibrated and deconvoluted fluorescent image from the same plane was then imported into the AFM software to secure the exact overlay between optical image and 3D surface structure. AFM measurements of the cell surface were performed in the tapping/intermittent contact mode with Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-cantilevers of a nominal spring constant of 0.35 N/m (type DNP, JPK Instruments). Selected squares of 10&#xD7;10 &#xB5;m (medium resolution) and of 1&#xD7;1 &#xB5;m (high resolution) were scanned at 0.5 Hz. AFM images were processed using the NanoWizard II Image Processing Software v3.2 (JPK Instruments). A 3D-topography was generated and presented as a 2D-image.</p>
