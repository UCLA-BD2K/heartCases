      <abstract>
        <p>A 45-year-old male patient presented with gradual onset of
headache, vomiting and blurring of vision of 28 days duration.
Ophthalmological examination revealed normal anterior
segment and pupillary reflex. No abnormality was detected
in the vitreous. Optic disc showed features of advanced
papilledema with normal macula and retinal periphery in both
eyes. Visual acuity was 20/200 in the right eye and counting
fingers close range in the left eye. Non-contrast computed
tomography of brain was normal and magnetic resonance
imaging showed sagittal sinus thrombosis without any evidence
of venous infarction or intracranial mass. Routine hematological
investigations revealed increased hemoglobin level, packed
cell volume and leucocytosis. Further investigation revealed
increased Vitamin B12 and decreased serum erythropoietin.
A diagnosis of polycythemia vera was made from the above
findings. This case is being presented for the rarity of association
of polycythemia vera with bilateral advanced papilledema due
to sagittal sinus thrombosis.</p>

    <p>Polycythemia vera, also commonly called polycythemia rubra
vera, is a chronic clonal disorder characterized by elevated
red cell mass, normal arterial oxygen saturation, leucocytosis,
thrombocytosis and splenomegaly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> The signs and symptoms
of polycythemia vera are due to slowing of blood flow and
formation of thrombosis as a result of increased viscosity.</p>
    <p>Cerebral venous thrombosis is a rare and life-threatening
condition that should be considered in all individuals with
unusual and intractable headache. Young adults and children
are typically affected and the superior sagittal sinus is the
most commonly affected. Septic sagittal sinus thrombosis may
develop in relation to infection of ear or paranasal sinuses or
to bacterial meningitis. Etiological factors for aseptic sagittal
sinus thrombosis are head injury, tumors, oral contraceptive
pill, pregnancy and coagulopathies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> We report a rare case
of bilateral papilledema with thrombosis of posterior part of
sagittal sinus due to polycythemia vera.</p>

      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>A 45-year-old male presented with sudden onset of headache,
vomiting and blurring of vision of 28 days duration. Past
medical history was insignificant. Detailed ophthalmological
examination revealed normal anterior segment findings. The
pupillary reaction to both direct and consensual light reflex
was normal. Relative afferent pupillary defect was not detected.
Visual acuity in both eyes was reduced to 20/200 in the right
eye and counting fingers close range in the left eye. Visual field
could not be tested due to low vision. However, fundoscopic
examination revealed a clear optical media with significant
advanced papilledema in both eyes [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>]. The macula, fovea
and periphery of fundus in both eyes were normal. Non-contrast
computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain was found to be
normal, though magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed
features of sagittal sinus thrombosis without any evidence of
venous infarction or mass lesion [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>]. Routine hematological
and biochemical investigation revealed the following significant
features: Differential count- (Neutrophil 90 Eosinophil 02
Basophil 00 Lymphocyte 08 Monocyte 00); Total leucocyte count-
(164,000/mm<sup>3</sup>), Hemoglobin- 18 gm%; Packed cell volume-56%
total platelet count-4.4 lakhs/mm<sup>3</sup> ; prothrombin time -25.55sec
and INR (International normalized ratio)-2.04.</p>
      <p>High level of hemoglobin, packed cell volume and a raised
platelet count with leucocytosis aroused the suspicion of
polycythemia vera and on further hematological investigation,
it was found that serum Vitamin B12 level was increased
(796.0 pg/ml) and serum erythropoietin level was decreased
(2.19 U/L). Taking all the above parameters into account and in
consultation with a hematologist, the diagnosis of polycythemia
vera with bilateral papilledema was made.</p>
      <p>The patient was treated initially with subcutaneous injection
of Heparin (40 mg twice daily) and acetazolamide 250 mg orally
twice daily. Therapeutic venesection was done followed by
systemic hydroxyurea (500 mg four times daily to start followed
by 500 mg twice daily). Headache and vomiting subsided within
10 days of initiation of treatment. On follow-up visit after three
weeks, a marked recovery of vision was observed in the right
eye with visual acuity 20/30 and no improvement was seen in
the left eye due to post papilledema optic atrophy.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Cerebral venous thrombosis is a rare clinical entity. Septic
sagittal sinus thrombosis may develop in relation to infection
of ear or paranasal sinuses or to bacterial meningitis. Etiological
factors for aseptic sagittal sinus thrombosis are head injury,
tumors, oral contraceptive pill, pregnancy and coagulopathies.
It affects sagittal sinus (71%) more often than any other dural
sinuses because of its high position, low pressure and slow
flow.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> The symptoms and signs of sagittal sinus
thrombosis are related to the site of occlusion. It is minimal in occlusion
of the anterior part of the sagittal sinus and the symptoms
are headache and paresthesia. When the posterior part of the
sagittal sinus is affected, the neurological consequences are
devastating.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> Such patients complain of severe headache which
is often worse at night or when arising and may be increased
by bending or performing the Valsalva maneuver. In many
patients, vision becomes transiently obscured. These episodes
usually affect both eyes, last 10 to 15 seconds, sometimes
precipitated by bending, coughing or standing. Constant
blurring of vision, diplopia, tinnitus and syncopal spells may
occur, but less frequently.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> Decreased visual acuity in one or
both eyes, enlarged blind spots, concentric decrease in visual
fields can also be present in chronic papilledema.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></p>
      <p>The papilledema is usually bilateral and symmetric, however
it may be unilateral and asymmetric; the visual sensory function
is usually not affected unless macular hemorrhage and exudates
or papilledema become chronic. In aseptic thrombosis due to
polycythemia vera, the raised intracranial pressure usually
results from occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus producing
the symptoms of papilledema, which results from impaired
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption and consequent elevation
of intracranial pressure.</p>
      <p>Cerebral sinus thrombosis is diagnosed by CT scan or MRI.
On non-contrast CT scan a thrombosis is visualized as a linear
area of hyperdensity. On contrast imaging, a dark triangle
may be observed in the sinus, where flow is blocked and this
is termed as the <italic>empty delta sign</italic>. Magnetic resonance imaging
and magnetic resonance venography may demonstrate acute
thrombosis and lack of blood flow in involved sinus. It remains
the best diagnostic tool and should not be delayed if there is a
clinical suspicion of thrombosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></p>
      <p>Medical management of cerebral venous thrombosis should
include attention to the treatment of seizures, broad-spectrum
antibiotics for septic thrombosis, detection and management of
metabolic derangements and management of cerebral edema and
elevated intracranial pressure. Patients with aseptic thrombosis
are treated with anticoagulant to combat risk of hemorrhage.
Prolonged anticoagulation may be required for refractory cases
or for patients with an identified pro-thrombotic state.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></p>
      <p>For patients who complain of progressive or rapid loss of
vision, the procedure currently favored by ophthalmologists
is fenestration of optic nerve sheath which consists of partial
unroofing of the orbit and intraorbital incision of the dural-
arachnoid sheaths surrounding the optic nerve.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> In some cases
surgical thrombectomy can be done. In patients who do not
respond to these conservative measures, lumbo-peritoneal shunt,
ventriculoperitoneal or ventriculoatrialshunt, and subtemporal
decompression is necessary to reduce CSF pressure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></p>
      <p>In a patient of polycythemia vera, the management is
only to prevent thrombotic complication and to maintain
normal hematocrit level by doing periodic phlebotomies and
the correction of raised intracranial pressure. Hydroxyurea
or Interferon-&#x3B1; or Anegrelide can be given to control
thrombocytosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Visual prognosis in patients with papilledema
treated medically or surgically is generally good.</p>
      <p>In our case the patient was diagnosed and treated
earlier, because of which he regained his vision. Hence any
case presenting with bilateral papilledema should always
necessitate a thorough clinical, hematological, biochemical and
radiological workup and prompt treatment in order to save
vision and life. The ophthalmologist may play an important
role in the care of patients with polycythemia vera since ocular
lesions may precede potentially serious extra-ocular disease.</p>
