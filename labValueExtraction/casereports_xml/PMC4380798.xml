        <p id="P1">Transcriptional elongation is critical for gene expression regulation during embryogenesis. The super elongation complex (SEC) governs this process by mobilizing paused RNA polymerase II (RNAP2). Using exome sequencing, we discovered missense mutations in <italic>AFF4</italic>, a core component of the SEC in three unrelated probands with a novel syndrome that phenotypically overlaps Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), that we have named CHOPS syndrome (C for <underline>C</underline>ognitive impairment and <underline>C</underline>oarse facies, H for <underline>H</underline>eart defects, O for <underline>O</underline>besity, P for <underline>P</underline>ulmonary involvement and S for <underline>S</underline>hort stature and <underline>S</underline>keletal dysplasia). Transcriptome and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses demonstrated similar alterations of genome-wide binding of AFF4, cohesin and RNAP2 between CdLS and CHOPS syndrome. Direct molecular interaction between SEC, cohesin and RNAP2 was demonstrated. This data supports a common molecular pathogenesis for CHOPS syndrome and CdLS caused by disturbance of transcriptional elongation due to alterations in genome-wide binding of AFF4 and cohesin.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P2">Transcriptional regulation during embryogenesis is of paramount importance in determining the precise temporospacial gene expression pattern. Recent evidence suggests that such transcriptional control is mainly achieved by the regulation of transcriptional elongation<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Approximately 50 base pairs after transcriptional initiation, RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) pauses in genes whose expression is mainly controlled by elongation phase. For this transcriptional pausing, NELF(negative elongation factor) and DSIF(DRB Sensitivity Inducing Factor)(a heterodimer of SPT4 and SPT5), are required <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Serine residues located within the C-terminus heptapeptide repeats of RNAP2 undergo phosphorylation modifications during gene transcription. Ser5 phosphorylated RNAP2 (RNAP2 Ser5ph) is enriched at the promoter proximal region and Ser2 phosphorylation occurrs after transcriptional elongation starts. Therefore, Ser2-phosphorylated RNAP2 (RNAP2 Ser2ph) is regarded as actively elongating RNAP2 <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Mobilization of the paused RNAP2 machinery is governed by the super elongation complex (SEC) which is comprised of multiple proteins including AFF4, ELL2 and the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) which is a heterodimer of CDK9 and cyclin T1<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. CDK9 phosphorylates the Ser2 residue of RNAP2 in order for initiation of transcriptional elongation <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P3">Since many multiple congenital anomaly genetic conditions are due to the disruption of proper transcriptional processes during embryogenesis, disruption of the transcriptional elongation process would be a likely underlying pathogenic mechanism for developmental disorders however to date no causal links have been identified. Through the characterization of a novel genetic disorder caused by gain-of-function mutations in the <italic>AFF4</italic> gene, encoding a critical component of the SEC, we have established a link between the dysregulated transcription observed amongst disorders of cohesin function (collectively termed &#x201C;cohesinopathies&#x201D;) and disruption of RNAP2 elongation, caused by altered genome-wide binding of AFF4 and cohesin.</p>

        <title>A novel genetic disorder caused by <italic>AFF4</italic> missense mutations</title>
        <p id="P4">Germline mutations of cohesin complex structural and regulatory components cause Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) (OMIM 122740, 300590 and 610759)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. CdLS is a multisystem developmental disorder characterized by craniofacial dysmorphisms, intellectual disabilities, growth retardation, limb anomalies and several other systemic abnormalities<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Mutations in <italic>NIPBL</italic> have been identified in nearly 60% of CdLS probands, and <italic>HDAC8</italic>, <italic>SMC1A</italic>, <italic>SMC3</italic> and <italic>RAD21</italic> mutations account for an additional small portion of patients with CdLS<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. The probands (CHOPS T254S, CHOPS T254A and CHOPS R258W) found to have <italic>AFF4</italic> mutations were originally suspected of having CdLS, due to intellectual disability, short stature and craniofacial dysmorphisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1a</xref>). However, clinically, their physical features are distinctively different from typical CdLS probands and allowed us to classify this as a novel clinical entity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We propose &#x201C;CHOPS syndrome&#x201D; as an acronym to describe this novel genetic disorder: &#x2018;C&#x2019; for <underline>C</underline>ognitive impairment and <underline>C</underline>oarse facies, &#x2018;H&#x2019; for <underline>H</underline>eart defects, &#x2018;O&#x2019; for <underline>O</underline>besity, &#x2018;P&#x2019; for <underline>P</underline>ulmonary involvement and &#x2018;S&#x2019; for <underline>S</underline>hort stature and <underline>S</underline>keletal dysplasia.</p>
        <p id="P5">The striking phenotypic similarities between the three unrelated probands, all born to unaffected non-consanguineous parents, led us to hypothesize that their clinical features were likely the result of a detrimental germline <italic>de novo</italic> mutation in the same gene. To test this hypothesis, we performed exome sequencing of these three probands. Each proband had 414 (CHOPS T254A), 720 (CHOPS R258W), 725 (CHOPS T254S) rare deleterious mutations (non-synonymous, protein truncating, deletion/duplication or splice site mutations) respectively. Exome statistics are listed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>. Among these, variants in 16 genes were identified in common to all probands. However, the variants in 14 genes were found to also be present in in-house control samples, arguing against causality. Variants in the remaining two genes, <italic>AFF4</italic> and <italic>ZFHX3</italic>, were scrutinized further. Genetic variants of <italic>AFF4</italic> and <italic>ZFHX3</italic> were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. All of the missense mutations found in <italic>AFF4</italic> (c.760A&gt;G (p.Thr254Ala), c.761C&gt;G (p.Thr254Ser) and c.772C&gt;T (p.Arg258Trp)) were <italic>de novo</italic> (not present in the 6 biological parents of the 3 probands) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.1</xref>). All 3 missense mutations were located within the ALF (AF4/LAF4/FMR2) homology domain of AFF4, and these missense mutations altered highly evolutionarily conserved amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1b</xref>). All of the identified <italic>ZFHX3</italic> variants were inherited from one of the parents of each proband (all of whom were unaffected). Paternity was confirmed by STS markers in all three probands. Screening of an additional 25 probands with atypical features of CdLS for mutations in the <italic>AFF4</italic> gene failed to identify mutations. However none of these probands exactly fit the CHOPS syndrome phenotype indicating that mutations in this gene are highly correlated with the specific phenotype as characterized by the 3 patients described here. Collectively this data supports that the missense mutations in the ALF homology domain of AFF4 cause CHOPS syndrome.</p>

        <title>Mechanism of <italic>AFF4</italic> mutations leading to CHOPS syndrome</title>
        <p id="P6">A missense mutation in the ALF homology domain of <italic>Aff1</italic> (<italic>Af4</italic>) was reported in the robotic mouse, an ataxia mouse model created by ENU mutagenesis<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. The pathogenetic mechanism of this missense mutation is a gain-of-function effect due to decreased clearance of the protein by SIAH1 ubiquitin E3 ligase<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Given the vicinity of the location of the missense mutations in our probands to that described in the robotic mouse, we hypothesized that the missense mutations found in the three probands would likewise disrupt the ubiquitinylation-dependent proteasomal degradation of the AFF4 protein. To test this hypothesis, we created an AFF4 and SIAH1 overexpression model using HEK293T cells. When a wild type (WT) AFF4 expression vector was transfected with an SIAH1 expression vector, the amount of AFF4 protein was significantly decreased; however the AFF4 constructs containing the missense mutations found in the three CHOPS syndrome probands hindered the degradation of AFF4 with SIAH1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The addition of MG132, which is a proteosomal degradation inhibitor, resulted in the recovery of AFF4 bands.</p>
        <p id="P7">Several genes including <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>JUN</italic> have been identified as direct transcriptional targets of AFF4<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Upregulation of <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>JUN</italic> expression was confirmed in patient derived skin fibroblast samples by quantitative RT-PCR, although one proband with an AFF4 p.Arg258Trp alteration had a normal expression level of <italic>JUN</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The expression levels of <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>JUN</italic> were also evaluated in HEK293T cells with AFF4 overexpression vectors. With WT AFF4 overexpression, the expression level of <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>JUN</italic> increased, confirming that <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>JUN</italic> are downstream targets of the AFF4 protein.

The amount of AFF4 protein in patient derived skin fibroblasts was elevated, supporting the suggestion that the missense mutations found in these probands results in a more stable AFF4 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4a</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P15">Through the identification of gain-of-function mutations in <italic>AFF4</italic> as the cause of a novel syndrome consisting of a highly conserved pattern of features that we have termed CHOPS syndrome, we demonstrate that an altered RNAP2 distribution and resultant transcriptional elongation abnormalities underly the transcriptional dysregulation of CHOPS syndrome as well as CdLS.</p>
      <p id="P16">CHOPS syndrome represents the first human developmental disorder caused by germline mutations in an SEC component, although synonymous mutations were previously suggested to correlate with autism in two individuals<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. AFF4 is a scaffold protein comprising the core component of the SEC. In the probands reported here, the missense mutations create a resistance to ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal degradation, resulting in excessive amounts of mutant AFF4 protein accumulation. This persistence of AFF4 protein in turn results in an altered genomic distribution of AFF4 and leads to the unique transcriptome pattern of CHOPS syndrome. The transcriptome effects of <italic>AFF4</italic> gain-of function mutations seen in CHOPS syndrome were opposite to that observed in AFF4 knock-down experiments, confirming that the disease mechanism of these mutant AFF4 proteins is a gain-of-function rather than haploinsufficiency or a dominant negative effect. In addition the phenotype of the CHOPS syndrome probands is different from that of the Aff4 knock-out mouse as well as in human subjects with genomic deletions encompassing the <italic>AFF4</italic> gene lending further support to a gain-of-function effect<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Comparing the AFF4 binding patterns among the up-regulated genes, and down-regulated genes, AFF4 alteration was seen only in the up-regulated genes, further supporting the notion that the primary effect of AFF4 mutations found in CHOPS syndrome is a gain-of-function, leading to transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). The fundamental role of transcriptional elongation in gene expression control during embryogenesis has been better understood recently<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, CHOPS syndrome can be regarded as a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome caused by disturbance of the transcriptional elongation process.</p>
      <p id="P17">Although accumulation of AFF4 was observed in the transcriptionally activated genes in CHOPS syndrome and CdLS, there was no correlation between AFF4 ChIP-seq and RNA-seq/RNAP2 Ser2ph ChIP-seq in either syndrome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). This finding suggests that AFF4 controls gene expression for only a subset of AFF4-bound genes, which is consistent with previously reported data by Luo et al., demonstrating that the knock down of AFF4 leads to down-regulation of expression of only a very small subset of genes (7 genes) among the genes that harbor an AFF4 ChIP-seq peak around TSS in 293T cell line <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. In CHOPS syndrome and CdLS, transcriptional alterations are more likely seen in the genes where expression is mainly regulated by the transcriptional elongation step. Similar findings were reported for other transcription elongation controller molecules such as DSIF and NELF <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P18">In the CHOPS syndrome fibroblast cell lines, even with the massive accumulation of AFF4 in the chromatin fraction, the amount of other SEC components (i.e. ELL2 and CDK9) remained unchanged. However, the amount of these proteins forming SEC is likely to be increased, given that the primary effect seen in CHOPS syndrome is activation of AFF4 target genes. CDK9 is known to form a complex with BRD4 or 7SK RNA and HEXIM outside of the SEC as well as existing as a free CDK9 molecule <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Therefore, the amount of CDK9 forming SEC is likely to be increased with the concurrent decrease of CDK9 forming complexes with BRD4 or 7SK RNA and HEXIM or free CDK9 in the nucleus. This speculation is supported by the fact that transfection of AFF4 alone exerted transcriptional activation effects on SEC target genes such as <italic>MYC</italic> or <italic>JUN</italic>, even without cooverexpression of other SEC components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P19"><italic>AFF4</italic> is expressed in the fetal brain, lung and heart, and adult brain, heart, skeletal muscle and pancreatic tissues <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. It is very intriguing that all CHOPS syndrome probands manifested with chronic lung disease, given the strong expression of <italic>AFF4</italic> in fetal lung. In addition, AFF4 is implicated in the regulation of the appetite, because hypothalamic <italic>AFF4</italic> expression is up-regulated upon fasting <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is possible that gain-of-function mutations of <italic>AFF4</italic> have led to increased appetite, resulting the obesity seen in CHOPS syndrome probands.</p>
      <p id="P20">While CHOPS syndrome and CdLS are clinically recognizable distinct entities there is some phenotypic overlap between these two diagnoses suggesting a common underlying pathogenesis. Given the apparently divergent molecular etiologies of each we were somewhat surprised to discover striking similarities in the transcriptome profile between CHOPS syndrome and CdLS.</p>
      <p id="P21">Effects on gene transcription by mutated cohesin components/regulators has been proposed as the pathogenic mechanism of CdLS establishing a critical role for cohesin in transcriptional regulation <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. One mechanism by which cohesin controls transcription is through the creation of looping DNA structures that allow for physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and promoter regions<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. However, the exact mechanism by which cohesin regulates transcription remains poorly understood.</p>
      <p id="P22">We discovered that both CHOPS and CdLS syndromes display a similar disruption in behavior of AFF4 and RAD21. Interestingly, the genes significantly increased in CHOPS syndrome and CdLS demonstrate elevated AFF4 binding. In combination with the finding that similar sets of genes were up-regulated and down-regulated in both CdLS and CHOPS syndrome, we can conclude that the altered genome-wide distribution of AFF4 binding affects cohesin binding in CHOPS syndrome with the inverse relationship being true in CdLS (altered genome-wide distribution of cohesin affects AFF4 binding).</p>
      <p id="P23">Furthermore, as a molecular link between CHOPS syndrome and CdLS, we demonstrated a physical interaction between SEC, STAG1-cohesin complex and RNAP2. This represents the first demonstration of such a physical interaction not only between SEC and cohesin but also between cohesin and RNAP2. Recently, functional differences between the STAG1 and STAG2 components of cohesin have started to emerge. Previously, the <italic>Stag1</italic> knock-out mouse model demonstrated the importance of STAG1 in transcriptional regulation, as well as a critical function in chromosomal segregation<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Our results point towards a more significant role of STAG1 in the pathogenesis of CdLS.</p>
      <p id="P24">Previously, a role for cohesin in transcription elongation has been proposed. Cohesin selectively binds genes in which RNAP2 pauses just downstream of the transcription start site, and it was hypothesized that cohesin facilitates transition of paused RNAP2 to elongation<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. This role of cohesin in transcriptional elongation is likely facilitated by NIPBL/MAU2, with AFF4 and the SEC mediating its effect. Recently, the cohesin loaders (NIPBL/MAU2) were shown to be important in maintaining nucleosome-free regions in yeast models, and it was hypothesized that the derangements of nucleosome positioning cause transcriptional disturbance in the cohesinopathies<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Our observation suggests that NIPBL/MAU2 also plays a role in the transcriptional elongation process, which requires the presence of paused RNAP2 at gene promoters.</p>
      <p id="P25">In summary, we report the identification of a novel genetic disorder, CHOPS syndrome, caused by mutations in <italic>AFF4</italic>, and demonstrate that altered genome-wide biding of AFF4 leading to RNAP2 gene body accumulation underlies the transcriptional abnormalities. We also demonstrate a molecular link between CHOPS syndrome and CdLS, and implicate a role for cohesin in transcriptional elongation. These observations underscore the importance of proper proximal pausing of RNAP2 as a crucial regulator of gene expression during human embryogenesis.</p>

ChIP was performed as previously described <sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Briefly cells were crosslinked by 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. Soluble cell lysates were prepared by sonication or both MNase treatment and sonication.

After decrosslinking of elutes and Input, DNA was purified using PCR purification kit (Qiagen). DNA from Input and ChIP fractions was further sheared to an average size of approximately150 base pairs (bp) by ultrasonication (Covaris), end-repaired, ligated to sequencing adapters and amplified according to manufacturer's instructions (NEBNext ChIP-seq Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina; New England Biolabs). Sequenced reads were mapped to the human genome using Bowtie version 1.1.0 <sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, allowing two mismatches in the first 28 bases per read and outputting only uniquely mapped reads (-n2 &#x2013;m1 option).

        <p>Western blot analysis of the SEC components in CHOPS syndrome skin fibroblast cell lines. (a) CHOPS syndrome sample cell lysates demonstrate a stronger AFF4 band, however, the amounts of NIPBL, MAU2 and SMC1 were unchanged compared to the control samples. GM02036 and GM03348 are control samples. (b) Accumulation of AFF4 in the chromatin fraction was seen in the CHOPS syndrome samples, however, the amount of ELL2 and CDK9 remained unchanged. Numbers beneath the bands represents the signal intensities normalized against the band intensity of the control GM02036 sample, and also normalized against alpha tubulin in total cellular lysates and histone H3 in chromatin fraction samples. *The asterisk indicates a nonspecific band. CdLS sample used was CDL006 with a frameshift mutation of <italic>NIPBL</italic>.</p>

        <p>Molecular interaction among SEC, cohesin and RNAP2. Results of immunoprecipitation-Western blot. (a) Protein interaction between SEC and cohesin. STAG1 (SA1) interacts with various SEC components including AFF4, ELL2, Cyclin T1 and CDK9. Immunoprecipitation with STAG2 (SA2) did not show such interaction with SEC. Addition of DRB slightly increased the amount of SEC components interacting with SA1. (b) Protein interaction between cohesin and RNAP2. STAG1 (SA1) interacts with various forms of RNAP2. Addition of DRB (D) and flavopiridol (F) decreased the amount of RNAP2 Ser2ph and Ser5ph precipitated with STAG1. RNAP2 was not immunoprecipitated with STAG2 (SA2) antibody.</p>

        <p>In this table, the group means are average expression levels of genes measured by microarrays, after normalization and log2-transformation. The processed measurements were compared between groups by the SAM method to generate the p values, and the un-log transformed measurements were used to calculate the percentage of expression change between groups.
