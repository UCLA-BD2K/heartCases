    <p>We report a case of a polytrauma victim who required central venous catheter insertion in intensive care. This line was inserted but required replacing due to malposition felt to be caused by unidirectional twisting motion.</p>
    <p>A 78-year-old female was involved in a road traffic collision and sustained multiple injuries including pneumothoraces, diaphragm rupture and a lacerated spleen. She had chest drains placed and proceeded to laparotomy with splenectomy. Post-operatively she required dialysis in the intensive care unit.</p>
    <p>A central venous catheter (CVC) &#x201C;Arrow 12 FR Blueguard&#x201D; was placed in the right subclavian vein using a Seldinger technique. After dilatation the catheter was advanced. In order to overcome some resistance in its placement a unidirectional clockwise rotating action was used. Initially position seemed satisfactory because of some ventricular ectopics associated with the guide wire and easy aspiration of blood from both ports.</p>
    <p>Chest radiograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">figure 1</xref>) showed the dialysis line was twisted into a U-shape position. It was removed and a new line one was fed through into position.</p>

    <p>A repeat chest radiograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">figure 2</xref>) indicated that withdrawal of the dialysis line had pulled the left subclavian CVC out of position and therefore also required replacement.</p>

    <p>CVCs are placed commonly in emergency departments and intensive care units. Risks associated with central venous cannulation include malposition (9.3%), bloodstream infection (4.0%), arterial punctures (3.0%) and pneumothorax (1.5%).<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> This particular complication has not previously been described.</p>
    <p>The rotating technique used to advance the catheter caused the twisting motion, which may have resulting in kinking of the line. This case demonstrates a potential complication of the Seldinger technique. Smaller motions in both clockwise and anticlockwise directions could prevent this complication occurring in future.</p>
