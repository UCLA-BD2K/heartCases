      <abstract>
        <p>Patients with Disorders of Sex Development (DSD), especially those with gonadal dysgenesis and hypovirilization are at risk of developing malignant type II germ cell tumors/cancer (GCC) (seminoma/dysgerminoma and nonseminoma), with either carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic> (CIS) or gonadoblastoma (GB) as precursor lesion. In 10&#x2013;15% of 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis cases (i.e., Swyer syndrome), <italic>SRY</italic> mutations, residing in the HMG (High Mobility Group) domain, are found to affect nuclear transport or binding to and bending of DNA. Frasier syndrome (FS) is characterized by gonadal dysgenesis with a high risk for development of GB as well as chronic renal failure in early adulthood, and is known to arise from a splice site mutation in intron 9 of the Wilms&#x2019; tumor 1 gene (<italic>WT1</italic>). Mutations in <italic>SRY</italic> as well as <italic>WT1</italic> can lead to diminished expression and function of SRY, resulting in sub-optimal <italic>SOX9</italic> expression, Sertoli cell formation and subsequent lack of proper testicular development. Embryonic germ cells residing in this unfavourable micro-environment have an increased risk for malignant transformation. Here a unique case of a phenotypically normal female (age 22 years) is reported, presenting with primary amenorrhoea, later diagnosed as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism on the basis of 46,XY gonadal dygenesis with a novel missense mutation in <italic>SRY</italic>. Functional <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showed no convincing protein malfunctioning. Laparoscopic examination revealed streak ovaries and a normal, but small, uterus. Pathological examination demonstrated bilateral GB and dysgerminoma, confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Occurrence of a delayed progressive kidney failure (focal segmental glomerular sclerosis) triggered analysis of <italic>WT1</italic>, revealing a pathogenic splice&#x2013;site mutation in intron 9. Analysis of the <italic>SRY</italic> gene in an additional five FS cases did not reveal any mutations. The case presented shows the importance of multi-gene based diagnosis of DSD patients, allowing early diagnosis and treatment, thus preventing putative development of an invasive cancer.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Disorders of Sex development (DSD) are congenital conditions of incomplete or disordered gonadal development leading to discordance between genetic sex, gonadal sex, and phenotypic sex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Hughes1">[1]</xref>. DSD occurs with an estimated incidence of 1&#x2236;5000 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Hughes1">[1]</xref>. Individuals with an underlying DSD, especially those with specific Y chromosomal material in their karyotype, have an increased risk for developing a type II germ cell tumor/cancer (GCC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Cools1">[2]</xref>. GCCs arise from primordial germ cells (PGC) or gonocytes and can be subdivided into seminomas/dysgerminomas and non-seminomas with carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic> (CIS) or gonadoblastoma (GB) as precursor lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Oosterhuis1">[3]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Hersmus1">[4]</xref>. GCC risk varies, but is estimated to be over 30% in patients with complete gonadal dysgenesis and is often bilateral <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Cools1">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Frasier syndrome (FS), currently classified as 46,XY DSD, complete gonadal dysgenesis, is characterized by gonadal dysgenesis, a high risk for development of a GCC and chronic renal failure in early adulthood. Usually patients with complete gonadal dysgenesis are not diagnosed at birth because of their normal female appearance of external genitalia. However, these patients will not develop secondary sex characteristics at pubertal age, and will generally attend the clinic because of primary amenorrhea, with hormonal analysis showing hypergonadotropic hypogonadism because of lack of gonadal function.</p>
      <p>Wilm&#x2019;s Tumor 1 (WT1) is an important regulator of early gonadal and kidney development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Kreidberg1">[5]</xref>. It is expressed earlier in time than SRY in the urogenital ridge, from which the gonads and kidneys are derived. All known WT1 isoforms share four C-terminal zinc fingers which are necessary for DNA/RNA binding. The two major WT1 isoforms are produced by alternative splicing, resulting in an insertion (+KTS) or exclusion (-KTS) of lysine, threonine and serine between zinc fingers three and four. The &#x2013;KTS isoform mainly plays a role in transcription, and <italic>AMH</italic> transcriptional activation in Sertoli cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Nachtigal1">[6]</xref>. The +KTS isoform is involved in RNA processing, and in the mouse plays a role in <italic>Sry</italic> regulation <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Bradford1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Essential in the process of sex determination is the presence of the sex determining region on the Y chromosome (SRY) gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Polanco1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Ottolenghi1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Wilhelm1">[10]</xref>. <italic>SRY</italic> mutations residing in the HMG (High Mobility Group) domains are found in 10&#x2013;15% of the 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis cases and affect binding to and bending of DNA or nuclear transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Giese1">[11]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Sim1">[14]</xref>. As a consequence these mutations can lead to an early error in the process of sex determination preventing proper formation of a testis. Specific intron 9 splice site mutations in <italic>WT1</italic> resulting in a decreased WT1+KTS isoform are typically found in FS patients, leading to a diminished expression of SRY and subsequently SOX9, thereby disturbing testicular development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Schumacher1">[15]</xref>. Furthermore, knockout mice for the +KTS isoform showed sex reversal in males <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Hammes1">[16]</xref>. Thus both <italic>SRY</italic> and <italic>WT1</italic> mutations can cause (complete) sex reversal.</p>
      <p>A highly informative marker for the presence of type II GCCs (i.e. GB, CIS and their invasive counterparts dysgerminoma and seminoma as well as embryonal carcinoma) is the transcription factor OCT3/4, also known as POU5F1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Looijenga1">[17]</xref>. OCT3/4 is involved in the regulation of pluripotency, is expressed in PGCs and gonocytes during normal gonadal development, is required for PGC survival, and is lost after maturation to pre-spermatogonia in males and oogonia in females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Looijenga1">[17]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-deJong1">[20]</xref>. In DSD patients OCT3/4 positivity of the germ cells might be due to maturation delay and not due to malignant transformation. To distinguish between these, Stem Cell Factor (SCF, also known as KITLG) has been shown to be informative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Stoop1">[21]</xref>. GB arises in the context of granulosa cells, staining positive for FOXL2 and negative for SOX9 (a Sertoli cell marker), this in contrast to the precursor lesion arising in a testicular environment, being CIS, in which the supportive (Sertoli) cells are negative for FOXL2 and stain positive for SOX9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Hersmus2">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we present a unique case with bilateral GB and dysgerminoma in an adult woman presenting with primary amenorrhea at the age of 22 years, who was initially diagnosed with 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis. Mutation analysis identified a novel missense mutation (c.383A&gt;G, p.Lys128Arg) in the HMG domain of the <italic>SRY</italic>, which did not have a significant effect on transcriptional activation and nuclear import <italic>in vitro</italic>. Laparoscopy revealed streak ovaries with GB and dysgerminoma on both sides. During follow-up the patient developed progressive renal failure based on focal glomerulosclerosis. Subsequent analysis of the <italic>WT1</italic> gene revealed a splice site exon 9 mutation (IVS9+5 G&gt;A) resulting in the final diagnosis FS. Sequence analysis of DNA from five additional FS patients with a proven <italic>WT1</italic> mutation for <italic>SRY</italic> mutations did not reveal any variants, indicating that the presence of mutations in both genes in FS patients is rare. To our knowledge this is the first case describing a patient with a mutation in both <italic>WT1</italic> and <italic>SRY</italic>, and underlines the importance of proper diagnosis, especially in patients with an increased risk for GCC, allowing early diagnosis and treatment, thus preventing the development of invasive cancer.</p>

        <p>DNA encoding wild type SRY, mutant SRY and SF1 were cloned into the pcDNA3 mammalian expression plasmid (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), and sequence verified. To test for SRY activation of TESCO, <italic>in vitro</italic> luciferase assays were performed on a human embryonic kidney carcinoma cell line (HEK293T, ATCC, CRL-11268). Cells were cultured in DMEM, High Glucose, GlutaMAX media (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 1% sodium pyruvate and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.

        <title>Patient Clinical History</title>
        <p>A phenotypically normal female presented at the outpatient clinic with primary amenorrhoea at the age of 22. She reported to have had some vaginal bleeding at the age of 13 and 14 years which she thought was the start of menarche. This together with the fact that she grew up in different families was the reason of her late clinical presentation. Patient history mentioned migraine and severe asthma for which she was treated with corticosteroids. Physical examination showed normal female external genitalia, with Tanner stage III breast development and stage II pubic hair development. She had a scoliosis and 2.5 cm difference in length of her legs. Hormonal analyses at the age of 22 and 23 years revealed low oestradiol: 11 and &lt;10 pmol/L (normal 100&#x2013;1000 pmol/L), testosterone: 1 nmol/L (normal 0.5&#x2013;3 nmol/L), high FSH: 215 and 219 IU/L (normal 1&#x2013;8 IU/L), and high LH: 78 and 75 IU/L (normal 2&#x2013;8 IU/L) levels, indicating hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Furthermore an increase in serum creatinine levels 111&#x2013;217 umol/L (normal 90 umol/L) was found over the course of ten months suggestive of impaired kidney function, although not diagnosed at the time of presentation. Chromosome analysis on peripheral blood lymphocytes showed the presence of a 46,XY karyotype, and mutational analysis of the <italic>SRY</italic> gene revealed an, at that time, unclassified variant K128R (c.383 A&gt;G, p.Lys128Arg). Based on these results the patient was diagnosed with 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis. Laparoscopic examination showed streak ovaries and a normal, but small, uterus. Because of the known tumor risk in these patients, both ovaries were removed during this intervention (for histology, see below).</p>
        <p>Two months after gonadectomy the patient visited the emergency room with complaints of agonizing headache, which were caused by severe hypertension; her blood pressure was 200/127 mmHg, with a good response to treatment with Amlodipine. In addition, blood analyses showed severe renal failure and additional examinations showed that the progressive renal failure was due to primary focal glomerulosclerosis. The rapid progression of kidney failure together with the diagnosis of 46XY gonadal dysgenesis and bilateral GB and dysgerminoma (for histology, see below) triggered investigation for a <italic>WT1</italic> mutation. The patient is currently on haemodialysis and awaits kidney transplantation, which has to be postponed for five years (until 2014) due to the treatment of the GCC.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Sex determination and specifically testis differentiation in males is critically dependent on transcriptional regulation of a selective number of genes including <italic>WT1, SRY</italic>, and <italic>SOX9</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Koopman1">25</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Park1">26</xref>. Expression of the Y-chromosome located <italic>SRY</italic>, above a threshold and in a critical time window, is crucial in triggering testis formation. SRY will upregulate SOX9 which will orchestrate the formation of the pre-Sertoli cells and further regulates testis development. <italic>WT1</italic> is expressed in the gonadal ridges before the onset of SRY, and plays an important role in testicular as well as kidney formation. It has been suggested that the WT1+KTS isoform functions in terminal Sertoli cell differentiation and homeostasis through the maintenance of a critical level of <italic>SRY</italic> and <italic>SOX9</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Schumacher1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>SRY</italic> mutations play a role in 46,XY sex reversal (46,XY DSD) and in about 15% of 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis cases mutations are found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Cameron1">[27]</xref>. The majority of mutations reside in the HMG domain, which is involved in the binding and bending of DNA. Besides these, mutations located in one of the NLSs have been reported, resulting in a reduced nuclear import of SRY. The K128R mutation described here does not lead to a statistically significant reduction in transactivational activity as ascertained by an <italic>in-vitro</italic> assay, although a minor reduction (about 20%) was observed. In addition, although located adjacent to the cNLS of SRY, the mutation does not result in a significant reduction in nuclear import of the protein. This suggests that the phenotype of the patient is not due to a nuclear import defect as has been observed in other cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Harley2">[13]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Sim1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Hersmus3">[28]</xref>. Although the lysine on position 128 is conserved between man and mouse, mutation of lysine on position 128 to arginine does not affect regulation of SRY subcellular distribution by (de-)acetylation via p300 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Thevenet1">[29]</xref>. Taken together, the results show that the mutation has little effect on the <italic>in vitro</italic> transactivation and nuclear import assays available. Therefore it is unlikely that the SRY K128R mutation has a significant effect on the (gonadal) phenotype of the patient has, although a more dramatic effect of the mutation in an <italic>in vivo</italic> situation cannot be ruled out.</p>
      <p>Reviewing the literature shows that almost all gonadal dysgenesis cases with a proven <italic>SRY</italic> mutation (86 cases in total, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040858.s001">Table S1</xref>) show a female phenotype (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;81, 94%). Only a few cases show ambiguous genitalia (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;4), and one patient has a male phenotype with ambiguous genitalia (respectively 5% and 1%). In a total of 61 cases gonadal histology was analyzed: 18 showed a GB (30%), one a dysgerminoma (1%) and two GB along with dysgerminoma (3%). This strongly shows the known increased GCC risk in these patients (34% in this cohort). Only a limited number of papers describe the functionality of <italic>SRY</italic> mutations (20 in total, 23%), and the effects range from completely abolished DNA binding to no differences in DNA binding when compared to wild type SRY. Based on these data, no genotype-phenotype correlation can be gathered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040858.s001">Table S1</xref>). In some cases the mutations described are also present (in mosaic form) in male family members, with one showing hypospadias and cryptorchidism, one diagnosed with a testicular seminoma, and one without GCC and a normal male phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Isidor1">[30]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Filges1">[32]</xref> (refs 14, 15 and 54 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040858.s001">Table S1</xref>). Whether this is also the case in the patient described here, or the mutation arose <italic>de novo,</italic> cannot be investigated because family members are not available for analysis (see above).</p>
      <p>The patient described here was initially diagnosed as a 46,XY DSD complete gonadal dysgenesis and a (until now unclassified) mutation in <italic>SRY</italic> was found (i.e. Swyer syndrome), associated with GB and dysgerminoma. However, upon follow-up the diagnosis of progressive renal failure based on focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, prompted analysis of the <italic>WT1</italic> gene. Initially the mild renal impairment found at presentation was not considered to be indicative to screen <italic>WT1</italic> for mutations.</p>
      <p>Mutations in <italic>WT1</italic> play a role in 46,XY DSD (i.e. FS, Denys-Drash syndrome, and WAGR-syndrome), and those found in FS consist of <italic>WT1</italic> intron 9 splice-site mutations. These patients have complete 46,XY sex reversal, late onset kidney failure (between 10&#x2013;20 years), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, streak gonads, and a high risk for GB, but not Wilm&#x2019;s tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Klamt1">[33]</xref>. Sequence analysis of the <italic>WT1</italic> gene in the patient described here revealed a classic FS mutation in the intron 9 splice-site (IVS9+4 C&gt;T). This ultimately results in the decrease of the +KTS isoform and it is known that the subsequent reversion in +KTS/&#x2212;KTS ratio causes defects in the development of glomerular podocytes and male sex-determination, ultimately leading to _ephritic syndrome and male-to-female sex reversal, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Klamt1">[33]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Barbaux1">[34]</xref>. Careful review of the literature revealed that this is the first patient described having both a <italic>WT1</italic> as well as a <italic>SRY</italic> mutation; however in almost all cases described a mutation screen of both <italic>SRY</italic> and <italic>WT1</italic> was not performed. Analysis of five additional FS patient samples with a proven <italic>WT1</italic> mutation by conventional Sanger sequencing of the <italic>SRY</italic> gene did not reveal any mutations. The majority of FS patients described in literature are phenotypically females (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;48, 96%) and only two phenotypically males are presented (4%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040858.s002">Table S2</xref>). It also underlines the high incidence of GB and/or dysgerminoma in this patient group; 18 out of 39 patients with described gonadal histology showed GB (46%), in one patient carcinoma <italic>in-situ</italic> (CIS) is described, the precursor lesion of GCC in the testis, and in one patient GB next to CIS is described. Five patients had an invasive dysgerminoma next to the GB, one patient is described as having GB and a metastatic tumor, and one patient is mentioned as having dysgerminoma. In the other patients with described gonadal histology, the majority show streak gonads (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;17, 44%), in one it is described as a dysgenetic gonad and in one no gonadal tissue could be found. For the other patients no gonadal histology was analyzed (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;11).</p>
      <p>It has been described that <italic>SRY</italic> and <italic>SOX9</italic> expression can be diminished in FS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0040858-Schumacher1">[15]</xref> and one could speculate that in the case presented here the effects from reduced <italic>SRY</italic> expression by a mutated <italic>WT1</italic> were exacerbated by the presence of the SRY K128R mutation, although a reduced SRY function could not be shown conclusively <italic>in vitro</italic>. This situation may have contributed to the maldevelopment of the gonads, thereby creating the micro-environment in which embryonic germ cells can survive, and are prone to become malignant. However, screening an additional five FS patients with a proven <italic>WT1</italic> mutation did not reveal any sequence variants in <italic>SRY</italic>. Although this is a limited series of these unique cases, it indicates that presence of <italic>SRY</italic> mutations in FS is rare.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge this is the first patient described with a mutation in <italic>SRY</italic> together with a classical FS <italic>WT1</italic> mutation, and thus seems to be a rare condition. Nonetheless, in this patient an optimal diagnosis could have been made, if a screening for <italic>WT1</italic> mutation was performed at an earlier time point. The patient is currently on haemodialysis and awaits kidney transplantation, which has to be postponed for five years (until 2014) due to the GCC in her history. This case clearly demonstrates the significant role of proper diagnosis of the variants of DSD, especially in those with an increased risk for GCC, allowing early diagnosis and treatment, thus preventing the development of invasive cancer. The presence and type of <italic>WT1</italic> mutation has major consequences for the patient. We therefore suggest that <italic>WT1</italic> mutation screening should be performed in all patients with 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis, especially in case of an unclassified SRY variant, and not vice versa. In addition, careful evaluation of kidney function at early stage is recommended in these patients.</p>
