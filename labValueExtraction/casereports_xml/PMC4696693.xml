  <body>
    <p>In August 2013, a man in his 20s from Tonga, Polynesia, who had moved to the United States
in June 2010, was examined in a hospital in Portland, Oregon after experiencing 4 weeks of
fever, night sweats, headache, productive cough, shortness of breath, and weight loss. He
also reported pleuritic chest pain and abdominal pain radiating to his back. A computed
tomography scan showed lung and liver abnormalities. Blood cultures grew <italic>Brucella
suis</italic> biovar 1. After treatment with oral sulfamethoxazole (800 mg 3&#xD7;/d),
trimethoprim (160 mg 3&#xD7;/d), and doxycycline (100 mg 1&#xD7;/d); and intravenous
gentamicin (580 mg 3&#xD7;/d), the infection resolved. Because <italic>Brucella</italic>
infection is a reportable condition in Oregon, the case was referred to the Oregon Health
Authority Acute and Communicable Disease office, and authority personnel informed the
Oregon Department of Agriculture&#x2019;s veterinary officials that the patient had
routinely purchased pigs from a local farm for home slaughter, suggesting the patient may
have contracted <italic>B. suis</italic> from commercial swine.</p>
    <p>The US commercial swine herd is considered to be free of <italic>B. suis</italic>; however,
<italic>B. suis</italic> is endemic among feral swine and occasionally has infected
domestic swine (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>). Slaughter surveillance, primarily
by using the buffered acidified plate antigen test, is conducted routinely to identify such
events to prevent the re-establishment of <italic>B. suis</italic> in the commercial swine
herd and to protect workers. </p>
    <sec>
      <title>The Study</title>
      <p>Serum from sows culled on the farm in question had been collected during routine
slaughter surveillance. Two weakly positive results during the previous 3 years were
investigated by following the guidelines in the USDA Swine Brucellosis
Control/Eradication State-Federal-Industry Uniform Methods and Rules (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>); no brucellosis was confirmed.
Although feral swine reside in Oregon, none had recently been reported near the farm. </p>
      <p>The case-patient&#x2019;s lack of exposure to feral swine and a known exposure to
commercial swine required further investigation. An epidemiologic investigation to
evaluate the commercial herd&#x2019;s infection status would require testing of swine on
the premises and related farms, and tasks such as tracing sales from the herd and
testing swine possibly exposed to swine brucellosis by temporary movement of boars to or
from farms for breeding purposes. Such investigations can be costly, especially if there
has been extensive movement of swine in and out of the herd.</p>
      <p>Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses can
provide increased resolution to identify the source of infections without conducting
more expensive field investigations (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>). The National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) had
implemented WGS and SNP analysis as the primary means of genotyping <italic>B.
abortus</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> isolates and applied this
information to identify sources of other outbreaks. Although a project to sequence
<italic>B. suis</italic> isolates from animals of US origin was in process at the
time of this investigation, few had been sequenced. To rapidly investigate the case in
Oregon, laboratory staff from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention extracted
and provided DNA from the isolate recovered from the Oregon patient, and the NVSL
sequenced 59 <italic>B. suis</italic> biovar 1 isolates recovered from US-origin
animals. Oregon was declared free of swine brucellosis in 1987 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oregon.gov/ODA/programs/AnimalHealthFeedsLivestockID/AnimalDiseases/Pages/AnimalDiseases.aspx">http://www.oregon.gov/ODA/programs/AnimalHealthFeedsLivestockID/AnimalDiseases/Pages/AnimalDiseases.aspx</ext-link>),
and the NVSL did not have archived isolates from Oregon or surrounding states.
Consequently, isolates selected for sequencing were mostly from the southern United
States and had been recovered from domestic swine and cattle during 1993&#x2013;2013
(<xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Technical Appendix</xref> 1). A few isolates
were selected from dogs, horses, and humans, all of whom, based on data from
epidemiologic investigations, likely had contact with feral swine.</p>
      <p>To obtain the whole-genome sequences, we sequenced <italic>B. suis</italic> DNA on a
MiSeq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using 2&#xD7;250 paired-end chemistry
and the Nextera XT library preparation kit (Illumina), targeting 100% coverage. FASTQ
files from the instrument were put through the NVSL in-house analysis pipeline
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/USDA-VS">https://github.com/USDA-VS</ext-link>). Reads were aligned to <italic>B.
suis</italic> isolate 1330 (GenBank Reference Sequence accession nos. NC_017250 and
NC_017251) by using BWA (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>) and
Samtools (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>). We processed BAM
files (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>) by using the Genome
Analysis Toolkit best-practice workflow (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). SNPs were called by using the UnifiedGenotyper from
the toolkit, outputting SNP to variant call files (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). Results were filtered by using a minimum Phred
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.1000genomes.org/node/101">http://www.1000genomes.org/node/101</ext-link>) quality score (scaled probability of
SNP presence) of 300 and allele count of&#xA0;2. From the variant call files, SNPs
gathered were output in 3 formats: an aligned FASTA file (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/blastcgihelp.shtml">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/blastcgihelp.shtml</ext-link>); a tab-delimited
file with the position location and SNPs grouped and sorted; and a phylogenetic tree
created by using RAxML (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>). We
visually validated SNPs using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>). Sequencing files were deposited in the
National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under the
Bioproject PRJNA251693 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA251693">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA251693</ext-link> (online
Technical Appendix 1). </p>
      <p>Initially, as evidenced by the 60 isolates described, the United States could not be
ruled out as a source because of a lack of resolution. Two approaches were considered to
improve the resolution of the <italic>B. suis</italic> database: sequence enough
isolates originating in the United States to assess the likelihood that any US-origin
isolate would closely match, or sequence isolates originating from Tonga and determine
whether they were clustered with the isolate from the case-patient in Oregon. The
difficulty in obtaining isolates from representative feral swine throughout the United
States precluded the first option as a viable solution. To obtain isolates from Tonga,
we contacted the Ministry of Primary Industries in New Zealand for assistance; its staff
members provided DNA from 7 <italic>B. suis</italic> isolates recovered from patients
who were from Tonga. New Zealand is not known to have <italic>B. suis</italic> in its
feral or commercial swine populations; therefore, humans with diagnoses of <italic>B.
suis</italic> had likely been infected in another country. </p>
      <p>We constructed a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree comprising the Oregon human
isolate, the 59 field isolates from the United States, and the 7 isolates from New
Zealand recovered from patients from Tonga (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure</xref>). The branch labeled as OutGroup_suis3 roots the phylogenetic tree, and
the A node is the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for all isolates. Three lineages
evolved from the MRCA. Initially, the Oregon human isolate was the only representative
in its lineage. Without the perspective of the Tonga isolates, a US source for this
isolate could not be ruled out because it shared the same MRCA as 2 other lineages
occurring within the United States. All additional Tonga&#x2013;origin isolates
clustered tightly with the Oregon human isolate share a common ancestor at the B node.
The Oregon human isolate is anchored by 2 additional common ancestors: C and D. In
addition to the phylogenetic tree, a table displaying divergent SNPs of closely related
isolates, including nucleotide calls and the positions within the genome, was created
for transparency and clarity (<xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Technical
Appendix</xref> 2). Often, 1 or 2 SNP calls inform the epidemiology of a case. For
example, the 08-924 isolate recovered from a patient in Tonga in 2008 has 1 additional
SNP (a thymine at position 1809039 on chromosome 2) from sharing a common ancestor with
the Oregon isolate.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>WGS and SNP analysis effectively concluded that this case-patient was infected in Tonga
and not by swine in the United States. Thus, widespread testing of domestic swine was
not conducted; agricultural trade continued without restrictions, and postexposure
treatment of contacts participating in home slaughter or meat preparation was not
needed. This case also demonstrates the value of and need for an international database
of validated WGS isolates that can be used by both human and animal health officials in
their respective and collaborative epidemiologic investigations. Finally, this case
highlights the benefits of a One Health (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://onehealthinitiative.com/">http://onehealthinitiative.com/</ext-link><underline>) </underline>approach between
public and animal health, including state, federal, and international authorities.</p>
