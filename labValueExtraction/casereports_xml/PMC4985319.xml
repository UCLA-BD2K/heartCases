      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cardiac arrhythmias are common cardiac complications that may appear during pregnancy. Compared to nonpregnant women of childbearing age, an increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias has been reported in pregnant women, which is likely because of a combination of hormonal, hemodynamic, and autonomic changes.
<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[1]</sup></xref> Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the most common sustained arrhythmia with a reported incidence of 13 to 24 per 1000 pregnancies.
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[2]</sup></xref> Arrhythmias are significantly more frequent in patients with a history of arrhythmias with structural heart disease ahead of pregnancy. Pregnancy may trigger an exacerbation of preexisting arrhythmias, whereas other arrhythmias may occur for the first time. Fortunately, most maternal cardiac arrhythmias in pregnancy are benign and severe arrhythmias requiring aggressive therapies are rare.
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[3]</sup></xref> For benign arrhythmias, conservative therapies are preferred. However, not all cardiac arrhythmias can be conservatively treated in pregnancy. In fact, more than 30% of the time in patients with tachycardia is at risk for progression to dilated cardiomyopathy.
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[4]</sup></xref> Moreover, blood pressure is lower than normal during tachycardia, which can lead to poor placental perfusion and pose a risk to fetal health. The influence of arrhythmias during pregnancy on fetal and neonatal outcomes is harmful. Adverse fetal events have been reported in 20% of pregnancies, which included respiratory distress syndrome, small fetus for gestational age, prematurity, and congenital heart diseases.
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[5]</sup></xref> Therefore, hemodynamically unstable or dangerous rhythm disturbances that jeopardize the life of mother or fetus should be treated promptly. There are 2 main medical treatment options for symptomatic arrhythmias, including antiarrhythmic medications and catheter ablation.
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[6]</sup></xref> Drugs might be a choice for pregnant patients with symptomatic tachyarrhythmia; however, antiarrhythmic medications also carry risks and most drugs are classified as class C or D, except sotalol (class B), by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The 3 commonly used drugs, such as amiodarone, phenytoin, and atenolol, are class D because of their adverse maternal and fetal effects. The potential adverse risks of antiarrhythmic medications on the fetus include low birth weight, fetal demise, teratogenicity, and proarrhythmicity effects.
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[7]</sup></xref> Current recommendations also suggest avoiding the use of these drugs, especially during the first trimester if possible, and that medications with the longest safety record should be used first. It is important to optimize maternal health and to manage the mother's symptoms properly. A careful risk-benefit analysis of long-term medication therapy should be studied on an individual basis and discussed by the whole treatment team. Usually the minimum recommended dose should be applied first, and accompanied with periodical monitoring of clinical responses.
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[8]</sup></xref>
</p>
      <p>Although radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation is a highly successful procedure in the nonpregnant patients, there has been a reluctance to carry out ablation in pregnant women because radiation exposure can be potentially harmful to a mother and her fetus. In the case of drug refractory, life-threatening, poorly tolerated SVT and VT during pregnancy, higher risk strategies, such as catheter ablation procedure, should be considered.
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[9]</sup></xref> Fortunately, in recent years, 3-dimensional navigation system allows for the visualization of catheters with minimal or without fluoroscopy. In some centers, nonfluoroscopic catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias is now routinely performed by using 3-dimensional navigation system.[
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>]
These techniques reduce the threshold to perform ablation in pregnancy, thus avoiding the potentially harmful effects of antiarrhythmic drugs.

      <title>Case presentation</title>
      <p>Two women (aged 33 and 22 years old, respectively) with drug refractory arrhythmia during pregnancy (31 and 25 weeks of gestation, respectively) were referred to our hospital for catheter ablation. They both had arrhythmia episodes before pregnancy, which became more frequent or incessant and drug resistant during pregnancy. The 2 patients had structurally normal hearts. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> summarizes their baseline characteristics.</p>

      <p>Patient 1 was a 33-year-old pregnant primigravida at the 31st week of pregnancy with severe symptoms of premature ventricular contraction (PVC) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) refractory to &#x3B2;-blockers. Patient 1 had suffered from palpitations since childhood, but during pregnancy the symptoms became aggravated. A 24-hour Holter monitor recorded PVCs more than 50% of the time.</p>

      <p>A multidisciplinary consultation with the electrophysiologist, obstetrician, and medical physicist reached the consensus that fast or incessant arrhythmias pose a potential risk to the fetuses and mothers. Catheter ablation was recommended for the treatment. Since the patients and their relatives worried about the risk of radiation exposure to the fetuses, the patients finally chose to undergo catheter ablation using the Ensite NavX system with a zero-fluoroscopy approach. The 2 patients were informed of the potential risks to both themselves and their fetuses during the procedure. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China. Written informed consents were obtained from 2 patients before the procedures.</p>

        <title>Procedure</title>
        <p>Antiarrhythmic medications were discontinued for at least 5 half lives before the procedure. After performing local infiltration with 1% lidocaine, we obtained venous access from the femoral vein. Three orthogonal pairs of electrode patches were placed on the skin of the patient. Transthoracic electrical fields are created by emitting low-amplitude electrical signals through these patches. The right femoral vein was canulated with a 6 or 8&#x200A;F sheath and electrophysiology catheters were introduced. An electrophysiological study was performed using standard pacing protocols.[
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref>]
The entire procedure was done without any fluoroscopy and catheter navigation was guided by the Ensite NavX system, a nonfluoroscopic navigation.
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[10]</sup></xref> Mapping catheters were placed at the right ventricle apex, His bundle, or coronary sinus (CS); and appropriate geometry was drawn to allow for completion of the procedure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B).</p>
        <p>The mapping points were as follows: for Patient 1, the virtual geometry of the targeted area in the right ventricle was reconstructed after a rough mapping (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C); for Patient 2, the tricuspid valve was labeled with 5 white points according to electrophysiological characteristics before the ablation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B and C).</p>
        <p>End points were as follows: for Patient 1, abolishment of right ventricular outflow tract premature and VT; for Patient 2, no evidence of accessory pathway and noninducibility of tachycardia.</p>

        <title>Literature review</title>
        <p>We conducted a search of the PubMed, MedlinePlus, Embase, and Ovid databases until December 2015 using the following search terms: &#x201C;pregnancy&#x201D; and &#x201C;catheter ablation&#x201D; and &#x201C;zero-fluoroscopy&#x201D; or &#x201C;without fluoroscopy.&#x201D; No language restrictions were applied. Studies were reviewed for case reports that pregnant patients were performed on catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias. After screening titles and corresponding contents, 8 published studies were identified as meeting the search criteria.</p>

        <title>Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (Patient 2)</title>
        <p>Two catheters were introduced in CS and right atrium (RA). Atrial pacing protocols demonstrated a right accessory pathway consistent with atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT). Based on local unipolar and bipolar signals, 2 RF applications, lasting at most 5&#x200A;seconds were attempted but failed due to instable tissue contact, and then a Swartz R0 (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN) sheath was introduced via the navigation of ablation catheter (AB) inside. Finally, 3 RF applications (70, 70, and 90&#x200A;seconds, respectively) were delivered in the approximately 10:30 o&#x2019;clock region of tricuspid annulus and the accessory pathway was successfully ablated. The procedure time was 71&#x200A;minutes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p>

The studies had 3 patients with atrial tachycardia, 3 patients with atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT), 4 patients with AVRT, and 2 patients with persistent junctional reciprocating tachycardia. The mean maternal age was 29 years old (range: 20&#x2013;48), and catheter ablation was performed at a mean gestational age of 23.4 weeks (range: 10&#x2013;33). Ablations were successfully performed using RF energy. After the procedure, all women and fetuses were in good general condition and had an uneventful postoperative course. There were no reported recurrence of arrhythmia and complications related to the procedure.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We performed successful catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias in 2 patients without fluoroscopy under the guidance of Ensite NavX system. In our cases, the 2 patients&#x2019; burden of SVT or PVC/VT was severe enough to pose risks to both the mothers and fetuses. Standard antiarrhythmic drugs failed to control tachycardia, therefore catheter ablation became the final choice.</p>
      <p>According to the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology and the European Society of Cardiology guidelines, the recommendation of catheter ablation to treat pregnant women with SVT is IIB; the level of evidence is &#x201C;C.&#x201D; Catheter ablation is recommended for drug refractory, poorly tolerated SVT and to be performed in the second trimester. Actually, the mainly concerned issue about the safety of procedure is radiation dose and risk.
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[23]</sup></xref> As for catheter ablation to treat pregnant women with ventricular arrhythmia, there is no relevant recommendation,
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[24]</sup></xref> which may also be due to the lack of enough clinical data. Potential risks to the mother and fetus from catheter ablation during pregnancy include anesthesia-related risk, pacing-induced maternal tachycardia, and radiation exposure.
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[25]</sup></xref> Medical care for the maternal patient during procedure prompts technical challenges and safety concerns to the electrophysiology staff. Also, the anesthesia care should be individualized to the unique patient so as to prioritize the safety of the mother and fetus. Collaboration with a group of experienced anesthesia and obstetrics is generally considered necessary to guarantee maternal and fetal safety.
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[18]</sup></xref> In order to avoid aortocaval compression by the gravid uterus, the mother should be lying in the left lateral tilt position rather than the supine position.
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[22]</sup></xref> Frequent episodes may lead to a progressive deterioration in ventricular contractile function or a sudden reduction in cardiac output. Therefore, rapid pacing in tachycardia during the procedure should be minimized to avoid deleterious effects on fetal well-being. Generally, fetal cardiotocography was put to use for intraprocedural fetal monitoring. Changes in the fetal heart rate pattern in response to maternal physiologic condition might need to be identified and treated.
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[9]</sup></xref> In our 2 patients, the procedures were performed solely with local anesthesia and without sedation, which avoided the risk of systemic hypotension and potential low placental perfusion.</p>
      <p>Since conventional RF catheter ablation that required the use of fluoroscopy for the determination of cardiac anatomy and catheter navigation was applied as an effective method to eliminate the arrhythmogenic substrate in symptomatic patients with various types of arrhythmias,
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[26]</sup></xref> the concern has remained to avoid ablation associated with ionizing radiation and complications. Ionizing radiation exposure to interventional electrophysiologist is an underestimated risk because of its unpredictable side effects. Andreassi et al
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[27]</sup></xref> confirmed a significant correlation between years of work in a catheterization laboratory and the formation of micronuclei that were created by chromosomal breaks. A higher incidence of the left-sided brain tumors among this subgroup of clinicians suggested that the proximity of the left hemisphere to the x-ray source may be a culprit.
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[28]</sup></xref> Ionizing radiation exposure is relevant not only to the interventional electrophysiologist but also to the patients. Radiation exposure presents even more risks for individuals with special conditions such as patients with immune system dysfunction and pregnant women.
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[29]</sup></xref> Major concerns with catheter ablation during pregnancy are the risks of fluoroscopy to both the mother and the developing fetus. The potential side effects of radiation exposure to the developing fetus are various, including fetal death, major organ malformations, intrauterine growth restriction, microcephaly, and cognitive deficits.
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[30]</sup></xref> Case&#x2013;control studies have indicated that antenatal exposure of as little as 10&#x200A;mGy may increase the risk of childhood cancer.
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[31]</sup></xref> Radiation exposure to the fetus should be minimized particularly in the early pregnancy during neuronal development and organogenesis.
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[32]</sup></xref> Minimizing radiation exposure to the pregnant patient is the responsibility of the electrophysiologists when performing interventional radiologic procedure. Abdominal shielding of the mother, extending completely around the pregnant abdomen, limits fetal radiation exposure to theoretical less than 1&#x200A;mGy
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[33]</sup></xref> for the conceptus during catheter ablation procedure. To emphasize the importance of minimizing of radiation exposure during cardiac intervention procedure, the American College of Cardiology strongly recommends that all catheterization laboratories apply &#x201C;ALARA&#x201D; (as low as reasonably achievable) principle, which intends to protect both the staff and patient.
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[34]</sup></xref> Accordingly, to help realize this goal, the use of 3-dimensional navigation system for catheter ablation has grown.</p>
      <p>Electroanatomical navigation system has been applied for over a decade for localization and ablation of tachycardia substrates.
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[12]</sup></xref> Ensite NavX system was developed as a nonfluoroscopic 3-dimensional navigation system to guide procedures, and it has facilitated a significant decrease, and in some circumstances, complete elimination of X-ray exposure during catheter ablation.
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[35]</sup></xref> Elimination of fluoroscopy removes all the short- and long-term risks of teratogenicity and oncogenicity, especially in pregnant and pediatric patients. In addition to reduced ionizing radiation, nonfluoroscopic navigation system provides additional advantages compared with conventional fluoroscopy. The navigation system performs accurate 3-dimensional reconstructions of the geometry of both vessels and cardiac chambers, and visualizes all diagnostic and therapeutic catheters in real time and in 2 simultaneous views, leading to more precise spatial localization of the catheter.
<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[36]</sup></xref> The navigation system elucidates detailed individual variations in anatomy and electrogram distributions, and tags important sites, such as catheter locations and lesion sites, which can be accurately revisited. The system also can establish shadows of the catheter, which can be used to reposition the catheter in the case of dislodgment.
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[11]</sup></xref> We successfully performed a zero-fluoroscopy approach using the Ensite NavX system for ablation of incessant arrhythmia in pregnant patients without compromising ablation time, number of RF applications, or complications related to the procedure. In fact, catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmia (except arrhythmias originating in the left atrium) is now routinely performed without radiation exposure utilizing 3-dimensional navigation system in our center (unpublished data). Many studies have demonstrated that interventional cardiologists had experienced an alarming incidence (40%&#x2013;75%) of spinal complaints.
[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref>] An additional benefit of a zero-fluoroscopy approach is the removal of protective lead apparel by the medical staff, thus showing a significant reduction in physician injury associated with wearing heavy lead garments.
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[40]</sup></xref>
</p>
      <p>However, a zero-fluoroscopy approach has some limitations. It is not applicable to patients with arrhythmias arising from the aortic cusps, with newly implanted intracardiac leads, and with epicardial arrhythmias.
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[40]</sup></xref> It is also a little more costly than a conventional fluoroscopic approach due to the additional electrodes used. However, the increased costs may not outweigh the advantages, such as decreased radiation exposure and cancer risk. Based on economic considerations, Casella et al
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[10]</sup></xref> conformed that the increase in life expectancy and in period of life without cancer made minimally fluoroscopic approach economically affordable at a rough economical analysis. The cost may be cut down in the future through more widespread use of this technology. The transition from a fluoroscopy to nonfluoroscopic approach needs a learning curve, a fact that is mentioned in previous studies.
<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[41]</sup></xref> Learning nonfluoroscopic ablation manipulation can be fulfilled quickly, especially as most electrophysiologists are already using 3-dimensional navigation system in ablation procedures. After a period of adjustment, electrophysiologists will become more familiar with the procedures and gain more experience over time. A shorter learning curve can be anticipated with adult patients.
<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[42]</sup></xref> In conclusion, compared with the conventional fluoroscopic procedure, 3-dimensional navigation system makes catheter ablation more effective, with an almost complete absence of radiation, with lower RF energy, fewer RF applications, shorter procedure time, reduced spinal injuries, reduced risk of inadvertent atrioventricular block, and greater safety for staff and pregnant patients.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>We demonstrated that catheter ablation of SVT or PVC/VT in pregnant patients can be safely and effectively performed with a completely zero-fluoroscopy approach guided by the Ensite NavX system. Three-dimensional navigation system has the potential to change the traditional treatment strategy for clinically severe cardiac arrhythmias in pregnant women, away from medications and towards a cure. However, catheter ablation with advanced modern technology should be considered as a last resort for life-threatening and drug-resistant arrhythmias in pregnant patients.</p>
