      <abstract>
        <p>Optic pathway glioma associated with neurofibromatosis 1
has a classically indolent course. However, involvement of
the optic radiations is relatively rare and is associated with a
more aggressive course. A three-year-old girl presented with
strabismus and loss of vision in the left eye with relative afferent
pupillary defect and optic disc pallor. She had multiple caf&#xE9; au
lait spots. Visually evoked potential was suggestive of an optic
nerve conduction defect and magnetic resonance imaging of the
brain was suggestive of an optic pathway glioma involving the
optic nerves, the optic chiasma and the optic tracts. The optic
radiations and the dentate nuclei had hamartomas. Optic nerve
biopsy confirmed pilocytic astrocytoma. Radical radiotherapy
under general anesthesia was subsequently given. This case
report aims to highlight the involvement of the optic radiations
and the unusually aggressive clinical course in this case.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF-1) is a relatively common
(incidence 1 in 3000) autosomal dominant disorder.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> In addition
to multiple peripheral neurofibromas, NF-1 predisposes
to central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Most of these are
pilocytic astrocytomas, arise in children and are located in the
optic pathways or in the brainstem.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> A majority of the gliomas
arising in association with NF-1 are indolent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> and in the younger
age group do not require active intervention until progression
is documented or the disease is severe enough to affect visual
outcome. However, optic pathway gliomas in NF-1 may rarely
involve the optic radiations. Optic radiation involvement may
signal a more aggressive optic pathway glioma in patients with
NF-1.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> We report the case of a three-year-old girl presenting
with an unusually aggressive optic pathway glioma involving
the optic radiations associated with NF-1 and treated with
radiotherapy.</p>

      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>A three-year-old female child presented in the last week of April
2005 with a history of the left eye squinting intermittently and
not focusing well since 10 days. There were pigmented skin
lesions present since infancy.</p>
      <p>On ophthalmic evaluation, the best-corrected vision in the
right eye was 20/40 (N9) and in the left eye was counting fingers
at one foot with accurate projection of rays. There was left
eye exotropia with poor fixation without any abnormal head
posture. There was no nystagmus. Corneal reflex test showed a
deviation of 10 degrees. Prism bar cover test showed a deviation
of 20 prism diopters for distance and near.</p>
      <p>The extraocular movements were full. She had a relative
afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in the left eye. The skin
showed multiple caf&#xE9; au lait spots, [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>] some larger than
5 mm in the greatest diameter. Axillary and inguinal freckles
were also present.</p>
      <p>Visually evoked potential showed an optic nerve conduction
defect and delayed latency in the left eye as compared to the
right with normal amplitudes in both. Electroretinography
was normal.</p>
      <p>A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>]
performed in May 2005 showed a fusiform enlargement of the
left optic nerve with a thickened right optic nerve.</p>
      <p>The optic chiasma showed enhancement extending to
involve the optic tracts bilaterally. Posteriorly non-enhancing
altered signals appearing hyperintense were seen along the
optic radiations. A non-enhancing hyperintense signal was
seen in the dentate nuclei bilaterally - consistent with the classic
hamartomatous CNS fibromas of NF-1.</p>
      <p>The patient was referred to a neurosurgeon and the biopsy
of the optic nerve was done through left frontal temporal
craniotomy, which revealed Rosenthal fibers with eosinophilic
globular bodies [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>] strongly positive for Glial Fibrillary
Acidic Protein (GFAP) stain confirming a diagnosis of pilocytic
astrocytoma of the optic nerve.</p>
      <p>A diagnosis of NF-1 with bilateral optic pathway glioma -
pilocytic astrocytoma was made.</p>
      <p>Radical radiotherapy under general anesthesia was given
in September 2005; post radiotherapy, the gliomas significantly
regressed in size with reduced enhancement on a repeat MRI
done in April 2006. The altered signal in the dentate nuclei
however was unchanged. On post radiotherapy follow-up,
visual acuity in the right eye was 20/40 and in the left eye was
no perception of light. The fundus examination showed disc
pallor both eyes, left eye more than right.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The most common differential diagnosis of a child with
painless loss of vision, RAPD, strabismus and an abnormal
disc includes optic glioma, optic nerve meningioma, optic
neuritis and Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy (ADOA).
The diagnosis of optic nerve glioma associated with NF-1 in
this case was suggested by caf&#xE9; au lait spots, asymmetric disc
presentation and later supported by MRI findings and finally
the biopsy report.</p>
      <p>NF-1 is a rare condition characterized by hamartomas of
neural crest origin. It has an autosomal dominant inheritance
although half the cases are new mutations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></p>
      <p>Among the various clinical manifestations, astrocytomas are
the major type of CNS tumors in NF-1 and pilocytic astrocytoma
(WHO Grade I) the main histological subtype.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> A stable or a
very slow progressive course that may account for the overall
good prognosis of CNS tumors in NF-1 usually characterizes
pilocytic astrocytomas. Optic radiation involvement though
rare may signal a more aggressive optic pathway glioma in
patients with neurofibromatosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></p>
      <p>In pediatric patients with NF-1 and optic pathway gliomas,
the likelihood of visual loss is dependent on the extent and
location of the tumor by MRI and is particularly associated
with the involvement of post chiasmal structures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></p>
      <p>Considering the risk of visual loss, the NF-1 optic pathway
glioma task force<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> has recommended annual screening
including neuroimaging, for children with asymptomatic
NF-1 till the age of six. Thereafter, the interval is yearly for
those with optic pathway glioma and two-yearly for the rest.
Recommended guidelines for therapy include observation in
the case of a stable painless intraorbital tumor and good vision;
a tumor causing disfiguring proptosis and poor vision should
be excised. Progressive chiasmal tumors should be treated
with radiotherapy. Juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma has a better
prognosis among all the histological subtypes and a five-year
survival rate of 80 to 100% has been documented.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></p>
      <p>Our case was unusual in presenting with an unusually
aggressive course at a younger age with involvement of the
optic radiations requiring radiotherapy for the same. We
would like to reiterate the importance of a thorough systemic
evaluation of any child presenting with unexplained visual loss
and strabismus along with the importance of neuroimaging in
the diagnosis and prognostication of neurofibromatosis and
optic nerve glioma. Finally, optic nerve glioma involving the
post chiasmal structures including the optic radiations can
present as a more aggressive variant and warrants intervention
for the same.</p>
