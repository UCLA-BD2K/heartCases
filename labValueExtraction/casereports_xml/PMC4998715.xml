        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>The etiology of congenital scoliosis and its development remains unclear and has not yet been fully identified, even there are theories that congenital scoliosis could be derived from the failure of formation or failure of segmentation, which are etiologically heterogeneous with genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors contributing to their occurrence. We reported a case of long-term follow-up after posterior vertebral column resection (PVCR) in both identical twins with similar congenital kyphoscoliosis at thoracolumbar levels. Twin I had been noticed by his parents to have asymmetry of his back at age 5 years, but no treatment was given. Twin II was first noticed to have a spinal problem at 11 years of age by his parents. Overtime, spine of both twins became further deviated to the left with kyphosis and was referred to our hospital. Both monozygotic twins were treated by PVCR and satisfactory results were demonstrated at 10-year follow-up.</p>
        <p>This case is the first report on the surgical treatment with PVCR, almost simultaneously, in both identical twins who had similar congenital vertebral anomalies causing kyphoscoliosis. Both identical twins with congenital kyphoscoliosis had undergone surgical correction by PVCR, anterior support with a mesh cage and posterior fusion using pedicle screws at the age of 14 years and achieved a satisfactory correction and a stable spine without curve progression with 10-year follow-up.</p>

      <p>There are very few reports of congenital scoliosis in monozygotic twins.

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>Two male monozygotic twins, born in 1991, following a full-term pregnancy by cesarean section. The pregnancy was uneventful. Birth weights were 1870&#x200A;g (twin I) and 2800&#x200A;g (twin II), respectively, and twin I was treated for low birth-weight in the incubator for 1 month. There was no history of maternal toxin, drug, or smoking exposure during the pregnancy. The family history did not contain any cases of congenital spinal anomalies.</p>
      <p>Twin I had been noticed by his parents to have asymmetry of his back at age 5 years, but no treatment was given. Overtime, his spine became further deviated to the left with kyphosis and was referred to our hospital by a private clinic physician after a radiograph had shown congenital anomalies in the thoracolumbar spine at 13 years of age. The height and weight of Twin I was 155&#x200A;cm and 45&#x200A;kg. Trunk shift to right was 15&#x200A;mm and left thoracolumbar hump 40&#x200A;mm.</p>
      <p>Twin II was first noticed to have a spinal problem at 11 years of age by his parents. Overtime, his spine also became further deviated to the left with a severe kyphotic deformity, and he was referred to our hospital with twin I at 13 years of age. The height and weight was 158&#x200A;cm and 55&#x200A;kg, respectively. Trunk shift to right was 10&#x200A;mm and left thoracolumbar hump was 28&#x200A;mm.</p>
      <p>On the clinical examination, both twins were noted to have left thoracolumbar scoliosis and severe kyphosis. Examinations were otherwise within normal limits. Neurological examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were unremarkable. Both twins had normal electrocardiography (EKG), normal heart function without cardiac anomaly in echocardiogram, and normal pulmonary function (Twin I: FVC: 3.19&#x200A;L, FEV1: 2.92&#x200A;L, FEV1/FVC&#x200A;=&#x200A;86%, Twin II: FVC: 3.31&#x200A;L, FEV1: 3.03&#x200A;L, FEV1/FVC: 86%) in spirometry before surgery.</p>
      <p>Surgery was conducted with somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) monitoring, and we checked motor/sensory after surgery and during postoperative care. Motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring was not available in early years of our study because MEP was introduced in 2007 in our hospital. Surgical procedure was performed with PVCR and posterior fusion.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Twin I had a left thoracolumbar scoliosis of 50&#xB0; (T11-L2) and segmental kyphosis of 52&#xB0; (T11-L2) with T12 and L1 hemivertebra (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A and B). At the age of 14 years, Twin I underwent a PVCR of L1, hemivertbra resection of T12, anterior support with a mesh cage and posterior fusion with pedicle screws from T9 to L3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). The preoperative scoliosis of 50&#xB0; improved to 13&#xB0; postoperatively and maintained to 17&#xB0; at 5-year follow-up (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B) and 18&#xB0; at 10-year follow-up (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A and B).

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The etiology of congenital scoliosis and its development remains unclear and has not yet been fully identified.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The risk of deformity progression and its subsequent severity is affected by various factors including the number, type, and location of vertebral anomalies.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> There are very few reports of congenital scoliosis in monozygotic twins. Furthermore, no reports have been described in the literature about surgical treatment with PVCR almost simultaneously in identical twins with a long-term follow-up.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Associated malformations should be looked for clinically and with an appropriate work-up. Thorough physical examination including foot or leg asymmetry, craniofacial malformation, cardiac and urinary malformations should be performed as well as neurological examination including abdominal reflexes and root tension signs.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Both twins in our study showed normal physical and neurological examinations. Our case of monozygotic twins with analogous congenital spine anomalies was presented in both with significant kyphoscoliotic deformity at the thoracolumbar junction. However, there were some differences of clinical features between the twins. Twin I had low height and weight and was more severe trunk shift and thoracolumbar hump compared with Twin II.</p>
      <p>Diagnosis of congenital scoliosis/kyphosis is confirmed with whole spine posterior&#x2013;anterior and lateral radiographs and clinical findings, which were essential for the diagnosis of congenital scoliosis. Computed tomography (CT) with thin slices and reconstruction is useful, and MRI provides high-quality pictures of the cartilage end plates, possibly giving the best information on growth potential.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The treatment goal of congenital spine deformities is to obtain a balanced trunk and spine while maintaining as much normal spinal growth as possible and preventing neural deficit.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Complications that could occur in untreated congenital kyphoscoliosis include progression of curve, shoulder imbalance, trunk shift, pulmonary compromise, or directly damage the neurologic elements by growing in the canal.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Conservative treatment with bracing or localizer cast is not well indicated because braces usually do not affect progression of the congenital curve even if braces sometimes could be used to control compensatory curves that develop above or below the congenital curve.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The principle of surgery would give rise to allowing best management of severe complex pediatric deformities. Surgery is performed when progression of the curve is documented or an anomaly is predicted to have high risk of progress.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> There are 2 different main principles of surgery: (1) prophylactic surgeries and (2) corrective surgeries.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Surgical treatment should be selected for correcting the deformity, preventing curve progression, and reducing the influence of adjacent vertebral growth.</p>
      <p>Surgery is usually recommended for patients with severe spinal deformity, but the surgical treatment for severe spinal deformities in children is extremely challenging. There are various types of surgical procedure in the treatment of congenital kyphoscoliosis. However, the definitive treatment of the congenital kyphoscoliosis due to hemivertebrae should include removal of hemivertebrae. Recently, hemivertebrae excision through posterior approach and PVCR in pediatrics have been reported as the treatment of choice with successful results.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The indication of PVCR was congenital spinal deformities with a curve magnitude &gt;30&#xB0; with fast progression. This included documented progression of curve with &gt;10&#xB0; in a 1-year period, failure of the conservative treatment, or both.</p>
      <p>Congenital kyphoscoliosis is a complex 3-dimensional deformities with rotation.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> PVCR could enable translational correction as well as rotational correction of the spine with a controlled manipulation of the both spinal columns simultaneously via single posterior approach.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In our case, monozygotic twins with analogous spinal anomalies was described. Differences of vertebral anomalies at birth and differences of deformity type with different curve patterns during the growth between twins may be associated with complex interactions mediated by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors during the development of congenital scoliosis.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> However, little information exists regarding the relative contribution of each of factors to the development of congenital scoliosis.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The limitation of the study is that this case reports represents a rarity for the very fact that the anomalies occurred in monozygotic twins or that genetic plays a role in linking these twins. Grauers et al reported the findings on heritability of scoliosis following a survey of 64,578 twins in the Swedish twin registry and concluded that genetic factors were responsible for 38% of scoliosis cases as compared to 62% environmental association with the development of scoliosis.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> In fact the hemivertebrae stated in this study are not identical. There are many phenotypes which are identical in twins for many pathologies in spinal disorder, but this case does not seem to be one of them.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge, this is the first report on the surgical treatment with PVCR, almost simultaneously, in both identical twins who had similar congenital vertebral anomalies causing kyphoscoliosis. Both identical twins with congenital kyphoscoliosis had undergone surgical correction by PVCR, anterior support with a mesh cage, and posterior fusion using pedicle screws at the age of 14 years and achieved a satisfactory correction and a stable spine without curve progression with 10-year follow-up.</p>
