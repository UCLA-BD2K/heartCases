        <p><italic>Background</italic>. The incidence of unilateral twin ectopic
pregnancy is a rare condition. Several factors increase the risk
of ectopic pregnancy, the most important of which is pelvic
inflammatory disease, followed by operative trauma, congenital
anomalies, tumors, and adhesions resulting in anatomically
distorted fallopian tubes. We present a case of a woman with a
history of four confirmed sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
including <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>,
herpes simplex virus 2, and <italic>Treponema pallidum</italic>. The case
illustrates the potential impact of sexually transmitted
infections (STIs) on the risk of a twin ectopic pregnancy.
<italic>Case</italic>. A 24-year-old primigravida, presented with an
unknown last menstrual period, lower abdominal pain, watery
vaginal discharge, and vaginal spotting. During this
hospitalization, serum &#x3B2;-HCG testing was 263 mIU/mL and
transvaginal ultrasonographic examination suggested a nonviable
unilateral twin ectopic pregnancy. At exploratory laparotomy, a
10 cm mass involving the right fallopian tube and ovary was
excised. Pathological evaluation of the specimen identified a
monochorionic, diamnionic twin ectopic pregnancy
within the fallopian tube. <italic>Conclusions</italic> Patients with a
history of multiple (STIs) are known to be at risk for the
development of chronic pelvic infection and postinflammatory
scarring. The resulting distortion of the normal tubal anatomy
leads to an increased risk of an uncommon presentation of ectopic
pregnancy.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Patients with a history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
 are at increased risk for the development of
ectopic pregnancies because of postinflammatory fallopian tube
scarring and deformity. Unilateral twin ectopic pregnancy is a
rare condition, first described in 1891 by De Ott [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Live
twin ectopic pregnancies are thought to occur at a frequency of
1/125 000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Unilateral twin ectopic gestation is thought
to occur in approximately 1 in 200 ectopic gestations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].
One would therefore calculate a frequency of 1 in 20 000 pregnancies with a 1% ectopic rate in the United States.
Simultaneous bilateral tubal pregnancy is the rarest form of
double-ovum twin pregnancy.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="case">
      <title>CASE</title>
      <p>A 24-year-old primigravida with an unknown last menstrual
period presented to the emergency room with a 3-month
history of lower abdominal and lower back pain that radiated
into her right thigh. The pain occurred two to three
times daily, lasting 5 minutes with each episode and worsening
during the few days prior to presentation. During the
three previous months the patient described irregular vaginal bleeding and watery vaginal discharge. 
She was evaluated two months previously at another hospital and was diagnosed as
having a &#x201C;cyst.&#x201D; She was discharged with a narcotic prescription
that she noted had improved her pain, but did not relieve it.</p>
      <p>Her medical history revealed no prior surgeries or any
history of assisted reproduction. Coitarche began at 14 years
of age and she noted a minimum of 15 previous sexual partners.
Hospital medical records listed positive toxicology
screen results for illegal drugs on multiple emergency room
visits. During the previous 6 years, culture and serology results
documented four prior separate infections with <italic>Chlamydia
trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>, herpes simplex virus
2, and <italic>Treponema pallidum</italic>, respectively. The patient reported
that she completed treatment for all four infections. Current
testing for <italic>C trachomatis</italic> and <italic>N gonorrhoeae</italic> by DNA
probe was negative for both species. Serum testing for rapid
plasma reagin (RPR) was also negative. The patient did not
demonstrate any clinical sequelae of herpes simplex virus
and thus testing for this STI was not performed on the current
admission.</p>
      <p>On physical exam, the patient was afebrile, and her vital
signs were stable. Abdominal palpation elicited tenderness in 
the right lower quadrant. Pelvic examination revealed blood
in the vagina, a closed cervical os, uterine tenderness, and a
palpable right adnexal mass. Rectovaginal exam concurred
with the pelvic exam and stool guaiac testing for occult blood
was negative.</p>
      <p>Diagnostic testing showed a quantitative serum &#x3B2;-HCG
titer of 263 mIU/mL, a hematocrit of 38%, and a serum progesterone
level of 2.2 ng/mL. Additionally, ultrasonographic
examination displayed a 10 &#xD7; 10 &#xD7; 8 cm right adnexal mass
containing a nonviable twin pregnancy with each fetal
crown-rump length corresponding to a gestational age of 9.3
weeks. A separating linear echo was seen in the mass between
the two fetuses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>An exploratory laparotomy revealed a hemoperitoneum
containing 300 mL and a 10 cm right-sided pelvic mass incorporating
the right fallopian tube and ovary. Small intestine
and the appendix were adherent by fibrous adhesions to
the mass. The contralateral ovary and fallopian tube had numerous
adhesions distorting their normal anatomy. A right
salpingoophorectomy, an appendectomy, and an extensive
lysis of adhesions were performed. The patient's postoperative
course was uncomplicated.</p>
      <p>Pathological evaluation of the surgical specimen showed
a twin pregnancy within the fallopian tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). During
more detailed histopathologic examination, the finding
of a dividing membrane established the pregnancy to be
monochorionic diamnionic, and measurement of the twin
fetuses estimated their gestational age at 7 weeks.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="discussion">
      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Several factors are thought to increase the risk for ectopic
pregnancy. Pelvic inflammatory disease is associated with the
greatest increase in risk, but other associated factors include
operative trauma, congenital anomalies, tumors, adhesions,
and advancing maternal age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>Arey in 1923 suggested that anything that interferes with
the passage of the ovum through the tube increases the risk
of an abnormal placental implantation site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Additionally,
studies suggest a delay in ovum transport and in implantation
also increase the risk of monozygotic twinning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].
Minor trauma to the blastocyst during assisted reproductive technology may also lead to an increased incidence of
monozygotic twinning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Correspondingly, the majority of twin ectopic pregnancies have been monozygotic. As of 1990,
95% of twin ectopic pregnancies were reported as monozygotic
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>Despite these potential sources for ectopic twin gestation,
the reported incidence is low. Goker in 2001 reported only
the one hundred and first case of unilateral twin ectopic pregnancy,
and the sixth to be diagnosed preoperatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The
current case is the eighth in the literature to be diagnosed
preoperatively. One reason for the low incidence may stem
from the fact that fetal wastage in monozygotic twins is high and malformations are common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>In the current case, the patient's prior STIs may have had
a direct causal link to her ectopic twin gestation. Current
studies show that <italic>C trachomatis</italic> and <italic>N gonorrhoeae</italic> interfere with the function of the ciliated cells of the tubal mucosa,
thereby slowing ovum transport and increasing the risk for
tubal implantation. G&#xE9;rard reported that 7 of 10 tubes with
ectopic pregnancies were found to have <italic>C trachomatis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].
In addition to these findings, it has been demonstrated with
laparoscopy that one episode of PID resulted in a 12.8% incidence
of bilateral tubal occlusion, two episodes with a 35%
incidence, and three episodes with a 75% incidence of bilateral
tubal occlusion.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="conclusions">
      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <p>This case illustrates one of the long-term consequences of
STIs with respect to reproductive function. Patients with a history of multiple STIs are 
known to be at risk for development of chronic pelvic infection and its associated fallopian
tube scarring. The tubal anatomy distortion that ensues potentially
increases the risk for a presentation of ectopic pregnancy
that is considered uncommon.</p>
