        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a crucial health problem. With sudden death often being the first presentation, early diagnosis for ARVC is essential. Up to date, electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used diagnostic method without invasive harms. To diagnose and treat ARVC as well as possible, we should clearly elucidate its pathophysiological alterations.</p>
        <p>A 66-year-old farmer presented to the Emergency Department with continuous palpitation, chest tightness, profuse sweating, and nausea with no obvious predisposing causes. An ECG indicated ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure and acute confusion. After an immediate electrical conversion, his consciousness was gradually restored, and symptoms relieved. The patient was then transferred to the Department of Cardiology to receive ECG, echocardiography, coronary angiogram, biochemical assays, endocardiac tracing, and radiofrequency ablation.</p>
        <p>In the end, he was diagnosed with ARVC, evidenced by bilateral ventricle dilation and epsilon waves in leads V1&#x2013;V3. Appropriate therapies were provided for this patient including pharmacological intervention and radiofrequency ablation. Although the diagnosis of ARVC is not difficult, this patient's ECG manifested several interesting features and should be further investigated: T wave inversions were found extensively in the anterior and inferior leads, revealing the involvement of bilateral ventricles; VTs with different morphologies and cycle lengths were found, and some VTs manifested the feature of irregularly irregular rhythm, reminding us to carefully differentiate some special VTs from atrial fibrillation (AF); and epsilon waves gradually appeared in leads V1&#x2013;V3 and avR since the onset of ARVC. Most importantly, the epsilon waves behind QRS complex appeared in both sinus rhythm and ventricular premature beats/VT originating from cardiac apex, whereas the epsilon waves prior to QRS complex occurred in VT originating from right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT).</p>
        <p>The features of T wave inversion and epsilon wave in ECGs and the appearance of VTs with different morphologies can reflect the progression of ARVC. The position relationship between epsilon wave and QRS complex in VT depends on ventricular activation sequence, that is, the localization of epsilon wave depends on where VT is originating from.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>The institutional review board (Chengdu Military General Hospital) approved this work and waived the need for informed consent. In 2013, a 66-year-old farmer with a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and hypertension presented to the Emergency Department with continuous palpitation, chest tightness, profuse sweating and nausea with no obvious predisposing causes. The patient experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure and acute confusion. After an immediate electrical conversion, his consciousness was gradually restored, and symptoms relieved. Then, this patient was transferred to the Department of Cardiology for further evaluations and treatments. The patient's blood pressure was 105/75 mm Hg upon admission, with a heart rate of 75 beats/min, body temperature of 36.6&#xB0;C and respiration rate of 18 times/min. The heart border extended to the left, with the apical impulse located in the left 5th intercostal space, 1.0&#x200A;cm lateral to the midclavicular line. The patient had a history of hypertension over 30 years without regular antihypertensive medication. The highest blood pressure was 170/110 mm Hg. There was no family history of early coronary artery disease or sudden cardiac death. He did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs, and rarely consumed alcohol. He also reported no known contacts with sick persons and no recent travel.</p>
      <p>Twelve-lead surface electrocardiogram (ECG) of VT indicated that the origin of VT was at the boundary between right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and tricuspid valve. When VT increased to 150 beats/min or higher, no epsilon waves were found in the precordial leads (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A and B). In contrast, when VT decreased to 120 beats/min or lower, epsilon waves appeared in leads V1&#x2013;V2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C). Notably, the epsilon waves preceded QRS waves in leads V1&#x2013;V2, while endocardiac tracing confirmed that the corresponding local potential originating from RVOT appeared prior to the ventricular rhythm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D). Sinus ECG in the year of 2013 suggested a slight left deviation of electric axis, with a heart rate of 87 beats/min and flat T waves in lead II. T wave inversions were found in leads III, avF and V1&#x2013;V3, meanwhile epsilon waves were found following QRS complex in leads V1&#x2013;V3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). When the lead avR was amplified, epsilon waves were also found behind QRS waves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). Atrial premature beats appeared occasionally. Moreover, ventricular premature beats were also found to originate from the right ventricular apex, with epsilon waves appearing behind QRS waves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). In contrast, sinus ECG obtained in the year of 1999 revealed similar left deviation of electric axis, flat T waves and T wave inversions, but absence of epsilon waves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). Data from biochemical assays were as follows: cardiac troponin I level was 0.714&#x200A;&#x3BC;g/L (normal range, 0&#x2013;0.06&#x200A;&#x3BC;g/L), serum B-type natriuretic peptide level was 466.530&#x200A;pg/mL (normal range, 0&#x2013;100&#x200A;pg/mL), serum <sc>d</sc>-dimer level was 8.14&#x200A;mg/L (normal range, 0&#x2013;0.55&#x200A;mg/L), blood urea level was 11.69&#x200A;mmol/L (normal range, 2.90&#x2013;7.20&#x200A;mmol/L), serum creatinine level was 144.00&#x200A;&#x3BC;mol/L (normal range, 44&#x2013;133&#x200A;&#x3BC;mol/L), serum uric acid level was 611.40&#x200A;&#x3BC;mol/L (normal range, 100&#x2013;432&#x200A;&#x3BC;mol/L), and endogenous creatinine clearing value was 57.90&#x200A;mL/min (normal range, &gt;80&#x200A;mL/min). Echo data revealed remarkably enlarged right atrium and right ventricle, and widened ROVT. Uncoordinated motions of the left and right ventricular walls were also detected. Moreover, we also found aortic valve degradation with slight regurgitation, slight mitral regurgitation, and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. The left ventricular diastolic function was reduced to 55% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A and B). The coronary angiogram revealed no vascular stenosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C&#x2013;E). Based on the above-mentioned examinations, this patient met at least 2 major criteria, the bilateral ventricular dilation and the existence of epsilon waves, providing diagnostic support for ARVC.</p>

      <p>A diet with low salt and low fat was suggested. The patient was also treated with metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets (23.75&#x200A;mg daily, p.o.), amiodarone (200&#x200A;mg daily, p.o.), furosemide (20&#x200A;mg daily, i.v.), and compound &#x3B1;-ketoacid tablets (2.52&#x200A;g daily, p.o.). Moreover, VTs with different morphologies and cycle lengths were found during radiofrequency ablation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The substrate voltage mapping revealed that the anterior wall of RVOT was wrapped by circular scar (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). Considering the association of VT with scar areas, substrate ablation was chosen for this patient. The residual potentials in the scar areas were searched, and then linear and focal ablations were performed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). Neither programmed stimulation nor induced stimulation could induce VT after the procedure was completed, indicating the success of operation. The ECG after radiofrequency ablation showed sinus rhythm, with a heart rate of 61 beats/min, T wave inversions in leads III and avF, and epsilon waves and T wave inversions in leads V1&#x2013;V3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D). This patient was discharged from hospital on day 9 with a regimen of metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets (23.75&#x200A;mg daily, p.o.), amiodarone hydrochloride tablets (200&#x200A;mg daily, p.o.), spironolactone tablets (40&#x200A;mg daily, p.o.), and fosinopril sodium tablets (10&#x200A;mg daily, p.o.). The patient was followed up 3 months after discharge. He had no recurrent palpitation, chest tightness, profuse sweating or nausea. Although ARVC was the main diagnosis at the time of this patient's initial presentation, it is essential in such cases to perform a reassessment for the presence of structural heart disease, which can evolve over time.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The clinical manifestations of ARVC usually appear in patients ranging from 30 to 50 years old, and consist of premature ventricular beats, lightheadedness, ventricular arrhythmias, syncope, etc. In desmosome genetic analysis for Han Chinese group study, 21 mutations were identified from 48 cases, and <italic>PKP2</italic> was the most common mutated gene.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Furthermore, some studies focusing on cytoplasmic calcium overload have led to an apoptotic theory in which fibrofatty infiltration progressively occurs following inappropriate myocardial apoptosis.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Santulli et al<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> claim that the excitation-contraction coupling in cardiomyocytes is closely linked with type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2), the rare mutations of which were identified in patients of catecholaminergic polymorphic VT. Moreover, the augmented oxidative stress in metabolic syndrome patients can impair Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and Na<sup>+</sup>&#x2013;Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger activity, leading to cardiac electrical and structural remodeling.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Sardu et al<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> have revealed that metabolic syndrome can give rise to a higher recurrence rate of outflow tract premature ventricular contraction beats after catheter ablation. Based on Task Force Criteria 2010 proposed by a consensus report,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> ARVC can be recognized by electrocardiographic, morphological and functional features. Discrimination between ARVC and idiopathic RVOT-VT is very critical, as their prognoses and therapeutic options differ. The positive T-wave alternans test during exercise testing can be used to distinguish ARVC from idiopathic RVOT-VT.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> However, some recent studies suggested that there were multiple drawbacks in the diagnostic criteria for ARVC.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> With the research advancement, more elements may be introduced into the criteria, providing more accurate pieces of evidence for the diagnosis of ARVC.</p>
      <p>The electrical manifestations of right ventricle are important to aid in the differential diagnosis of ARVC. More than 90% of ARVC patients present ECG abnormalities which reflect the pathophysiology of right ventricle replaced by fibrous and fatty tissues.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In our patient, there are some intriguing findings in ECG. First, extensive T wave inversions were found in the inferior and anterior leads, and these repolarization abnormalities may serve as early ECG markers of biventricular involvement. Consistent with our findings, ARVC can no longer be regarded as an isolated disease of right ventricle. In one study of 42 patients, histologic involvement of left ventricle was found in up to 76% of participants.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> And such correlation could also be confirmed by serial echocardiographic examinations.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Second, VTs with different morphologies and cycle lengths were found during the operation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In patients with advanced ARVC, abnormal right ventricle may possess multiple arrhythmogenic foci to present several morphologies of VT.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> It is well known that irregularly irregular rhythm is an important feature of atrial fibrillation (AF).<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> One interesting finding was that some VTs occurred in the operation manifested irregularly irregular rhythm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D). After comparing the graphs obtained from surface and coronary sinus electrodes, the ventricular rhythm was confirmed. Therefore, we should differentiate special VT from AF when reviewing ECG. These results suggest that different arrhythmogenic foci share the same export. Third, several important features of epsilon waves were shown in the ECG, as follows: no epsilon waves were found in any lead of the sinus ECG obtained 14 years ago, whereas epsilon waves appeared in the precordial leads in the sinus ECG got during this hospitalization. Our case supports the concept that ARVC is generally progressive in nature, and that surface 12-lead ECG is able to assess disease progression. Although a previous research declared that serial electrocardiographic recordings failed to predict the progression of ARVC,<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> many studies have suggested that ECG changes are generally progressive in ARVC patients,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> which is in consistent with our present finding. Epsilon waves were found in lead avR of the present sinus ECGs, but not in his previous ones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A-C). Epsilon wave in the lead avR is an indicator of poor prognosis for ARVC patients. Thus, the prognosis of this patient is not optimistic. The epsilon waves appeared behind QRS complex in both the sinus rhythm and ventricular premature beats/VT originated from heart apex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B); in contrast, epsilon waves appeared in front of QRS complex in the VT originated from RVOT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C). To our knowledge, this feature has not been reported before. When VT happens, the position relationship between epsilon wave and QRS complex depends on ventricular activation sequence. The amplitude of epsilon wave may be associated with the number of survived cardiomyocytes in residual myocardium islands wrapped by fibrofatty tissues. Deeply understanding these features of epsilon waves can help us differentiate the site and severity of cardiac lesions, and thus providing pieces of evidence for the prevention and treatments of ARVC.</p>
