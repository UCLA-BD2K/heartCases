      <abstract>
        <p>We report the biophysical characterization of hair from a patient with a <italic>de novo</italic> ribosomopathy. The patient was diagnosed with a mutation on gene RPS23, which codes for a protein which comprises part of the 40S subunit of the ribosome. The patient presents with a number of phenotypes, including hypotonia, autism, extra teeth, elastic skin, and thin/brittle hair. We combined optical microscopy, tensile tests, and X-ray diffraction experiments on hair samples obtained from the scalp of the patient to a multi-scale characterization of the hair from macroscopic to molecular length scales and observe distinct differences in the biophysical properties in the patient&#x2019;s hair when compared to hair from other family members. While no differences were observed in the coiled-coil structure of the keratin proteins or the structure of the intermediate filaments, the patient&#x2019;s hair was 22% thinner, while the Young&#x2019;s modulus remained roughly constant. The X-ray diffraction results give evidence that the amount of lipids in the cell membrane complex is reduced by 20%, which well accounts for the other observations. The pathologies characterized by these techniques may be used to inform the diagnosis of similar <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in the future.</p>

        <title>Clinical Pathologies from <italic>de novo</italic> Diseases</title>
        <p>A clinical challenge often exists in addressing diseases arising from <italic>de novo</italic> mutations, as there is no defined diagnostic or treatment protocol. Some disease may present with symptoms similar to a different disease, leading to mis-diagnosis. Exome sequencing is rapidly becoming a useful tool to determine the genetic causes of <italic>de novo</italic> diseases [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, exome sequences may identify a number of genetic variants, which can add confusion when trying to determine the source of disease pathologies. The fast and detailed characterization of clinical pathologies can be a useful exercise when treating patients with <italic>de novo</italic> diseases and understanding their exomes [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], as only 10-50% of exome sequences result in a diagnosis [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149619.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
        <p>Here, we report the biophysical characterization of hair obtained from a Dutch, 12-year old, male patient with a <italic>de novo</italic> ribosomopathy. After 3 years of work, the patient was diagnosed with a mutation on gene RPS23, which codes for a protein which comprises part of the 40S subunit of the ribosome. The patient presents with a number of phenotypes, including hypotonia, autism, extra teeth, elastic skin, and thin/brittle hair. While the RPS23 gene mutation is associated with the patient&#x2019;s ribosomopathy, there is no clear connection between the mutation and the pathologies.</p>
        <p>Optical microscopy, tensile tests, and X-ray diffraction experiments were performed on hair samples obtained from the scalp of the patient and also hair from his family. These tests allowed for a multi-scale characterization of the hair from macroscopic to molecular length scales. We observe distinct differences in the biophysical properties in the patient&#x2019;s hair when compared to hair from other family members.</p>

        <title>General Properties of The Hair Fibre</title>
        <p>Human hair is a layered structure with a total diameter between 40-110 <italic>&#x3BC;</italic>m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149619.g001">Fig 1a and 1b</xref>). The inner most layer is the <italic>medula</italic>, followed by the <italic>cortex</italic>, then the <italic>cuticle</italic>, all bound together by cell-membrane complexes. The <italic>medula</italic> is a thin structure composed largely of disordered protein. The majority of the hair fibre is the <italic>cortex</italic>, which contains spindle shaped cells that lie parallel along the fibre axis. Most cortical cells are composed of keratin protein that is an <italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-helical protein, which forms coiled-coil dimers in strands along the fibre axis. 7 such dimers form bundles 75-90 &#xC5; in diameter, known as protofilaments. These protofilaments further aggregate into intermediate filaments. The <italic>cuticle</italic> is the outermost layer, which is composed of overlapping dead cells that form a protective barrier against the outside environment [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>

        <p>The details of hair structure and organization have been studied in the past with X-ray diffraction. In particular, the <italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-helical keratin structure within the <italic>cortex</italic> has been extensively studied since the 1930&#x2019;s [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A typical diffraction pattern is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149619.g001">Fig 1c</xref>).</p>
        <p>X-ray diffraction observes signals from keratin in protofilament bundles, the coiled-coil keratin dimers, and the lipids in the cell membrane complex. We have previously used X-ray diffraction to study the hair of a number of individuals with differing characteristics. Genetic similarities were observed, <italic>i.e.</italic>, similarities between the patterns observed in the hair of father and daughter strands, as well as similarities in identical twins [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We have also used X-ray diffraction to probe the effect of hair treatments on the hair structure. While no change was observed from the single use of shampoo, structural changes were observed due to permanent waving treatment [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
        <p>Changes to the molecular structure of the fibre will likely translate into changes in mechanical properties. Tensile tests of hair were performed by measuring the force required to pull the hair along its long axis. From the resultant stress-strain curve, the Young&#x2019;s modulus of the fibre was obtained.</p>
        <p>Certain genetic disorders may be diagnosed based on structure and properties of the hair fibre. For example, in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), the absence of the lipid 18-methyleicosanoic acid from the hair, caused by a mutation leading to the removal of an enzyme, comprimises the stability of the hair [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The development of a breast cancer screening protocol using X-ray diffraction of human hair has been extensively studied by James and Corino [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149619.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This screening protocol is already in the clinical trial stage, with an overall accuracy of greater than 77% and a negative predictive value of 99% [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Here, we examine the physical appearance, structural integrity, and microscopic structure of hair to characterize a phenotype of a novel ribosomopathy.</p>

        <title>General Properties of the Hair Samples</title>
        <p>This research was approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (HIREB) under approval number 14-474-T. Written consent was obtained from all participating adults, and informed consent was also obtained, in writing, from the next of kin on behalf of the children enrolled in the study. The subjects of the study included six members of a Dutch family: the male subject or patient (aged 12 years, denoted P), his mother (47 years, denoted M); his father (50 years, denoted F); a sister, denoted as Sibling 1 (8 years, S1); a brother, denoted as S2 (14 years, S2); and a second sister, herein denoted as S3 (10 years, S3). A set of &#x223C;50 hairs were received, untreated, from each person. Upon initial visual inspection, all hair samples appeared normal, with no obvious deformities. Some hairs from subject F were grey, likely due to his age [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149619.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The family maintains standard Western hygiene practices, and uses shampoo and conditioner on a regular basis such that the hairs cannot be considered &#x201C;virgin hairs&#x201D; [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
        <p>Surface images obtained of hair samples from all subjects were obtained using an Inverted Microscope. Representative images are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149619.g001">Fig 1d</xref>). The surface of all hair samples appear normal, with characteristic overlapping dead-cells forming a shingle-like appearance [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. No hairs imaged appeared to have surface abnormalities.</p>
        <p>The diameter of select hairs from each individual was extracted from microscope images, as described in Materials and Methods. Hair widths were measured in the centre of the hair fibre. Ten hairs were measured for each subject, and the averages and standard deviations are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149619.g002">Fig 2a</xref>). The average hair diameters were between 50 <italic>&#x3BC;</italic>m and 90 <italic>&#x3BC;</italic>m, with standard deviations on the order of 10 <italic>&#x3BC;</italic>m, in agreement with previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While subjects M, S1, S2, and S3 have average hair diameters of 80-90 <italic>&#x3BC;</italic>m, subjects F and P have diameters between 50-60 <italic>&#x3BC;</italic>m, indicative of a decrease of &#x223C;25%.</p>

        <title>Results of Tensile Tests</title>
        <p>Tensile tests were performed to examine the stiffness of the hair samples, as described in Materials and Methods. Three hairs from each person were tested, with a single measurement per hair. Stress-strain curves were obtained, which describe the force needed to extend a hair of length &#x2113; to an extension of &#x394;&#x2113;, recorded from &#x394;&#x2113; = 0 up to the point of hair fracture. A sample curve is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149619.g002">Fig 2b</xref>) (inset). The first linear portion of the curve is related to elastic stretching of keratin in the hair fibre, and the slope of this region is proportional to the Young&#x2019;s modulus of the fibre [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149619.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
        <p>The corresponding elastic moduli are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149619.g002">Fig 2b</xref>), along with the mean and standard deviation measured for each person. Note that F is not represented in the pulling experiments as his hairs were too short to be accurately measured with the setup available. Also, only two measurements are shown for S2 as the third yielded a result which was an order of magnitude higher than the rest, suggesting a systematic error occured during this measurement. The elastic moduli measured with this analysis are between 2 GPa and 6 GPa, which agree well with previous reports for human hair [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While the hair from the patient appears slightly stiffer than the others (4.1&#xB1;0.7 compared to 3&#xB1;0.5), the difference is not statistically significant.</p>

        <p>A number of peaks are observed and the assignment of scattering signals to biological structures is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149619.g003">Fig 3</xref>. The keratin proteins in the <italic>cortex</italic> are known to organize in bundles, whose structure is dominated by <italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-helical coiled-coils [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149619.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Coiled coils consist of <italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-helices wound together to form a ropelike structure stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. The coiled-coil motif is found in about 10% of the proteins in the human genome [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
        <p>The main features of this motif is a &#x223C;9.8 &#xC5; (<italic>q</italic><sub>||</sub>&#x223C;0.66 &#xC5;<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) equatorial reflection corresponding to the spacing between adjacent coiled-coils and a &#x223C;5.0 &#xC5; meridional reflection (<italic>q</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub>&#x223C;1.25 &#xC5;<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) corresponding to the superhelical structure of <italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-helices twisting around each other within coiled-coils [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

In addition, a broad ring of scattering was observed at <italic>Q</italic>&#x223C; 1.6 &#xC5;<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> by scattering contributions from the membrane complexes and an amorphous halo, as will be discussed below. In the 2-dimensional data, scattering signals from all individuals show good agreement in signal position and shape, suggesting that the overall molecular structure of the hair is not different in the patient <italic>vs.</italic> the rest of the family.</p>
        <p>To better understand the observed scattering, and to check for the possibility of subtle changes in the molecular structure of the hair, high resolution line scans were recorded along <italic>q</italic><sub>||</sub>, and displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149619.g004">Fig 4</xref>. These scans captured length scales of 2.1 &#xC5; up to 21 &#xC5;, and were performed with counting times 8-times longer than single lines in the 2-dimensional plots. Longer counting times significantly increased counting statistics. Lorentzian fits were used to describe the data. The profile at 9.8 &#xC5; represents scattering from keratin fibres. In addition, three other peaks were observed at 4.5 &#xC5;, 3.5 &#xC5;, and 2.3 &#xC5;.</p>

        <p>Peaks at 4.7 &#xC5; and 2.3 &#xC5; agree well with lipid correlation peaks observed in single and multi-component fluid lipid membranes [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149619.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In particular, the appearance of a second order tail correlation peak at 2.3 &#xC5; is strong evidence this scattering can be assigned to ordered lipids within the cell membrane complex. A peak at 3.5 &#xC5; is a characteristic &#x201C;amorphous halo&#x201D; often observed in disordered polymer/biopolymer systems, and related to a typical carbon-carbon distance [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149619.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, as the cell membrane complex is oriented along the radial axis of the fibre, the lipid peak should be oriented along <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub>. The peaks at 4.5 &#xC5; and 3.5 &#xC5; were integrated as a function of azimuth angle <italic>&#x3D5;</italic> away from the <italic>q</italic><sub>||</sub> axis from the 2-dimensional data and the results (for subject M) are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149619.g005">Fig 5</xref>.

SAXS profiles of human hair show peaks at 90 &#xC5;, 45 &#xC5;, and 27 &#xC5;, which describe the form-factor of keratin protofilaments. No changes in position or width in any of these peaks are observed among the subjects tested. However, an observable increase in intensity is observed at 45 &#xC5; for M. In a recent X-ray diffraction study of human hair, an increase in this peak was shown to be the result of permanent waving treatment, caused by the use of reducing/oxidating agents in the treatment [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>

To quantitatively test this observation, regions of the 2-dimensional plots were integrated to capture scattering from the keratin peak as well as the lipid peak. We note that the lipid and amorphous contributions could be well separated to exclude a contribution of the amorphous halo. The ratio of these two integrated intensities is proportional to the volumetric ratio of lipid and keratin in the hair fibre.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Hair of a male patient, aged 12 years, with a novel ribosomopathy was tested by various biophysical techniques. One of the symptoms of the patient&#x2019;s novel disorder is thin, brittle hair. Optical microscopy, tensile tests, and X-ray diffraction were combined to examine the structure and properties of the hair fibre on macroscopic and microscopic length scales. In comparing the results from his fibres to his family&#x2019;s, the goal was to identify and characterize a clinical phenotype in hair for this ribosomopathy.</p>
      <p>In general, measurements of all the hair yielded results which were within normal limits, indicating all hair samples were intact. The diameter, Young&#x2019;s modulus, and molecular structure of the hair samples all agreed with previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, there were subtle variations observed between the patient and his family.

        <p>First of all, the hair fibre of the patient is measurably thinner. His hair is an average of 60 <italic>&#x3BC;</italic>m in diameter, while the diameter of caucasian hair (for a teenaged male) is 70-80 <italic>&#x3BC;</italic>m [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149619.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Indeed, this is the diameter observed for the patient&#x2019;s older brother (S2) who is also a teenaged male. His father&#x2019;s hair is also closer to 55 <italic>&#x3BC;</italic>m in diameter, however, this is expected for an older caucasian male as the hair diameter is known to peak at 70-80 <italic>&#x3BC;</italic>m, at an age of 20-25 years for men, then decline monotonically with age [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149619.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The average diameter of his hair was measured to be 55 <italic>&#x3BC;</italic>m, which is in agreement with previous reports for men his age.</p>
        <p>Secondly, X-ray diffraction measurements suggest the patient has a lowered molecular ratio of lipids relative to keratin in his hair structure. The X-ray diffraction measurements are sensitive to the molecular packing of the lipid and keratin molecules, represented by in-plane peaks at 4.5 &#xC5; and 9.8 &#xC5;. The integrated area of these two peaks is proportional to the relative content of lipid and keratin molecules, respectively. The ratio of these areas is lowest in the patient. However, the position and width of these peaks agree, suggesting that while molecular fraction of these components has changed, their structure remains the same. This result can be explained by either an increase in the amount of keratin, or decrease in the amount of lipid.</p>
        <p>Note that like hair fibre width, the volume of lipids within the fibre is not constant with age. The volume of lipids increases rapidly at ages 8-10, then decreases again at age &#x223C;50 [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The members without the ribosomopathy follow a trend observed previously (as sketched by the black line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149619.g007">Fig 7c</xref>)) [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149619.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149619.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], while the patient does not.</p>
        <p>Lastly, the Young&#x2019;s modulus of the hair is not significantly different compared to his family. In past experiments, researchers have, in general, explained the linear stretching of the hair to elastic deformations of the keratin coiled-coils within the fibre, where the keratin proteins are modelled as Hookean springs [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Recently, however, Chou <italic>et al.</italic> related the linear regime to stretching of the protein matrix in contact with the keratin macrofilaments [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Since keratin is responsible for the restoring force (where the strength of the force is given by the Young&#x2019;s modulus), increased keratin by volume should increase the restoring force and Young&#x2019;s modulus. However, as no significant increase in stiffness is observed, we conclude that the concentration of keratin remains roughly the same. We can therefore report two main findings: the patient&#x2019;s hair is (1) thinner and (2) contains less lipid (and not more keratin) when compared to his family.</p>

        <title>Possible Relevance to Disease</title>
        <p>The patient studied here presents with a de novo ribosomopathy, caused by a mutation on gene RPS23. The patient&#x2019;s symptoms are analogous to other ribosomopathies, such as diamond-blackfan anemia (although he does not have anemia). The symptoms can be broadly classified as developmental issues, and include hypotonia, elastic skin, and learning disabilities.</p>
        <p>While the biophysical experiments here cannot conclusively connect the properties of his hair fibre to his disease, the results of this study suggest that the development of his hair is different from his families. There is evidence his hair fibre diameter and lipid content are not at normal levels. Ribosomopathies have, in the past, presented with endocrine deficiencies [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The endocrine system is involved in hair development [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and in particular plays a role in hair diameter and lipid content [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It can therefore be speculated that an altered endocrine system is responsible for the change in biophysical properties of the hair fibre.</p>
        <p>Many diseases result in observable changes to the hair fibre, making the hair fibre useful as a diagnostic tool. The biophysical characterization of hair has already been incorporated as a diagnostic tool for breast cancer [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In particular, the detailed study of hair can be used to characterize clinical pathologies and inform exome sequence analysis for the diagnosis of <italic>de novo</italic> genetic diseases. Changes in the properties of hair in this study are likely directly related to the presence of a <italic>de novo</italic> mutation in the patient. While the mutation in the subject studied here is already known, in the future, these results can be used to inform diagnosis of similar diseases.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>We report the detailed hair pathology of a patient with a mutation to the ribosome gene RPS23. The hair structure of a patient with a <italic>de novo</italic> ribosomopathy was analyzed from macroscopic to molecular length scales by optical microscopy, tensile tests, and X-ray diffraction. Results from the patient were compared to his family and to literature values, in order to characterize a phenotype for this ribosomopathy.</p>
      <p>X-ray diffraction did not reveal a change in the molecular structure of the hair, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the organization of keratin into coiled-coils and the structure of intermediate filaments. Visual inspection did not reveal any deformities in the hair fibre. However, diffraction results suggest the patient&#x2019;s hair has 20% less lipid content. In addition, we observe the diameter of his hair is reduced by 22%. Tensile tests were performed on the hair and revealed the Young&#x2019;s modulus of the fibre is roughly unchanged in the patient. The pathologies together suggest hair from the patient is subject to an altered developmental cycle caused by his ribosomopathy</p>
      <p>The diagnosis of diseases caused by <italic>de novo</italic> mutations can present clinical challenges. The detailed characterization of pathologies from these diseases can inform diagnosis. A detailed pathology can be used to reduce leads in exome sequencing to find <italic>de novo</italic> mutations and identify similar ribosomopathies in the future.</p>

        <p>Optical images of hair were also obtained on a Celestron (Model 44202) microscope with 10&#xD7; widefield lens. Image were recorded using a Sony DSCW310 Cybershot digital camera. A section of hair about 6 mm long was recorded, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149619.g008">Fig 8a</xref>). For each image, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149619.g008">Fig 8b</xref>), cross sectional intensity profiles were measured tangential to the hair fibre at five points along the hair, and the width of the hair extracted using this intensity profile.

        <title>Tensile Experiments of Hair Samples</title>
        <p>Tensile experiments were perfomed using an Instron 5943 single column testing instrument, operated by the Biointerfaces Institute at McMaster University. For performing tensile tests, the ends of the hair samples were mounted onto 1 cm &#xD7; 1 cm silicon wafers. First, the hair was tied into a tight knots at either end of the hair, within 5 mm of the end of the fibre. The knotted section of the hair was placed on a silicon wafer and then epoxy was applied. A second wafer was applied to the top of the epoxy, sandwiching the hair between the wafers and fixing the knot within the epoxy. This procedure was repeated for the opposite end of the hair. The samples were allowed to dry overnight before testing. This preparation procedure was designed to prevent slipping of the hair from the mount when it is pulled. Before testing, the effective length of the hair (the length of the hair visibly exposed between the two wafer sandwiches) was recorded. Also, microscope images were taken to determine the cross sectional area of the hair.</p>
        <p>The wafer mounts were then sandwiched between the opposing jaws of the Instron tensile tester. The force required to extend the hair a unit length (force <italic>vs.</italic> extension) was collected. The curves were recorded at a rate of 7% extension per minute. Measurements were taken to the point of mechanical failure, characterized by breaking of the hair. If a hair sample slipped out the epoxy at high stress, rather than fracturing, or fractured at a location within the epoxy, the measurement was not used for analysis. Experiments were performed at ambient conditions of 25&#xB0;C and 50% relative humidity.</p>
        <p>Stress-strain curves were obtained by normalizing the <italic>y</italic>-axis of the measured force <italic>vs.</italic> extension curves by cross sectional area of the hair sample (obtained from microscope images) and by normalizing the <italic>x</italic>-axis by the length of the hair. Three distinct regions are observed in stress-strain curves of hair, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149619.g009">Fig 9</xref>: (1) a linear regime at &lt;10% extension, followed by (2) a plateau at &#x223C;10% up to &#x223C; 30% extension; and (3) above 30%, extension another linear regime is observed up to the point of failure [<xref rid="pone.0149619.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The Young&#x2019;s Modulus is obtained by obtaining the slope of the linear regime at low extension by a linear fit.</p>

        <title>Diffraction Experiments</title>
        <p>To prepare hair for diffraction analysis, hair samples were cut into strands &#x223C;3 cm long. Care was taken to prevent stretching or deforming the hair strands during this process.

Focusing multi-layer optics provides a high intensity parallel beam with monochromatic X-ray intensities up to 10<sup>10</sup> counts/(s&#xD7;mm<sup>2</sup>). By aligning the hair strands in the X-ray diffractometer, the molecular structure along the fibre direction and perpendicular to the fibres could be determined.
