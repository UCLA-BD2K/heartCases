      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>About 210,000 valve replacement surgeries are performed annually worldwide.
Paraprosthetic regurgitations are a complication that can happen, especially in
mechanical prostheses and reoperations, reaching a prevalence of 10 to 15% in follow-up
studies<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Surgical treatment remains the first choice, especially when there are significant
symptoms and hemolysis. However, due to high perioperative mortality (6-14%)<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>,
percutaneous techniques for correction of paraprosthetic regurgitation have been
developed, although there are not yet specific occlusion devices.</p>
      <p>Real time three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3DTEECHO) plays a
fundamental role in the procedure since diagnosis, quantification of regurgitation,
location and measurements of the regurgitant orifice, guiding in real-time the
implantation of percutaneous prostheses.</p>
      <p>The initial experience of our service is four cases of occlusion of mitral
paraprosthetic regurgitation percutaneously. Although we have not achieved complete
resolution of regurgitation in three cases (two remained with moderate regurgitation and
one with discreet regurgitation), it is worth noting that the procedures were conducted
without complications and all patients improved functional class after implantation. In
order to discuss the role of echocardiography this context, we describe a case where the
complete occlusion of the paraprosthetic defect was achieved after implantation of the
devices.</p>

      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>Male patient, aged 76, assisted in August 2010, complaining of progressive dyspnea on
exertion for two years, which had worsened one month before, accompanied by episodes of
presyncope. The patient was diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis and, in January 2011,
he underwent surgery for aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthesis and was
discharged on the seventh postoperative day, which was uneventful.</p>
      <p>In April 2011, he was hospitalized with fever, dysarthria and ejection systolic murmur
in the aortic area. The hypothesis of infective endocarditis was confirmed by
transesophageal echocardiography that showed an image of an abscess near the anterior
annulus and prosthetic vegetations, and severe mitral regurgitation and mild left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Blood cultures were positive for <italic>S.
aureus</italic> and brain computed tomography scan showed left front hypodense lesion
(probably septic embolism). The patient received treatment with vancomycin, gentamicin
and rifampicin. He underwent further surgery with implantation of bioprostheses in
aortic and mitral positions. He was discharged after two months of hospitalization.</p>
      <p>After four months, the patient underwent transthoracic echocardiography that revealed
bioprostheses with anatomically normal leaflets and the presence of severe mitral
paraprosthetic regurgitation. This finding was confirmed by 3DTEECHO, which found the
location of the leak and measured the dimensions of the defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

          <p>Image "A" shows, on 3DTEECHO, mitral paraprosthesis discontinuity before closing
(arrow). In B, there are two devices (Amplatzer<sup>TM</sup> Vascular Plug III)
completely occluding the defect.</p>
        </caption>
        <graphic xlink:href="abc-101-01-0e08-g01"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Due to the high surgical risk, percutaneous correction of the paraprosthetic
regurgitation was chosen on November 30, 2011. The procedure was performed under general
anesthesia and started with the puncture of the right femoral vein and left femoral
artery. Subsequently, transseptal puncture was performed with the aid of
echocardiography, which helped find the catheter in position in order to allow access to
the mitral valve. Paraprosthetic regurgitation was then found by 3DTEECHO and measured
in its length and diameter to plan the number and size of devices to be deployed.
Subsequently, the interventionist tried to cross the defect assisted by 3DTEECHO. At
this time, the echocardiography was crucial, since the natural tendency of the catheter
is to cross the prosthesis through its center hole. Once the catheterization of the
defect was confirmed by 3DTEECHO, two therapeutic catheters were separately introduced
and two Amplatzer<sup>TM</sup> Vascular Plugs III were implanted. 3DTEECHO guided as to
the correct position and release of the prostheses. At the end, it was demonstrated that
the paraprosthetic regurgitation had completely disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1B</xref>). The procedure was uneventful. The patient was extubated
in the catheterization laboratory and remained under observation for about two hours and
taken to the infirmary.</p>
      <p>The patient underwent control transthoracic echocardiography after two days, which
revealed normal bioprostheses and no mitral regurgitation. He was discharged on the same
day.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="discussion">
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Worldwide experience with percutaneous correction of paraprosthetic regurgitation is
still small. In a case series published in 2008, with 27 patients who underwent
implantation of percutaneous devices, 30% showed a significant reduction in
paraprosthetic regurgitation without any deaths or significant complications related to
the procedure<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>In 2011, Sorajja et al showed the results of the largest case series to date. Of the 126
patients that underwent percutaneous correction of paraprosthetic regurgitation, 76%
left the catheterization laboratory without residual regurgitation or mild
regurgitation. In this group, during follow-up of three years, survival free of surgery
or cardiovascular death was 64%, while in the group with moderate/severe residual
regurgitation, this survival was significantly lower (31%). There were no deaths during
the procedure, but three deaths occurred within 30 days, in addition to two episodes of
cerebrovascular accident<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>3DTEECHO plays an essential role as an aid to the percutaneous treatment. Before the
procedure, this type of echocardiography allows confirming the diagnosis, the severity
of the defect, and assessing the likelihood of success by accurately placing the
paraprosthetic regurgitation, which is of paramount importance, because the largest case
series published showed that subsequent defects present a higher success rate after the
procedure<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, 3DTEECHO allows planning the number and size of the devices to be implanted
by defining the size and shape of the defect, which is only possible by
three-dimensional imaging. Note that after the release of the devices, because of the
possibility of embolization, a new catheterization of the orifice is dangerous.
Therefore, the interventionist needs to know in advance how many and which devices will
be used to achieve complete occlusion.</p>
      <p>During the procedure, 3DTEECHO helps guiding the catheter to cross the defect, because
the two-dimensional angiographic image does not allow finding the leak and does not
enable the interventionist to make sure whether the catheter is inside or outside the
prosthetic ring. During release of the device, real time echocardiographic monitoring is
necessary to monitor the complications that may occur, such as prosthesis migration and
compression of adjacent structures. Finally, evaluation of the result at the
catheterization laboratory through 3DTEECHO facilitates the patient's clinical follow-up
immediately after implantation of occlusion devices.</p>
      <p>It is worth mentioning that there are no percutaneous prostheses for the specific
purpose of correcting paraprosthetic regurgitation that fit the "irregular anatomy"
usually found in these cases. Therefore, the development of specific devices that can be
visible on echocardiography will certainly provide the best results.</p>
      <p>Anyway, percutaneous correction of paraprosthetic regurgitation in patients at high
surgical risk seems to be a promising method as experience with images, with the devices
and with the technique is gained. Interventionists, echocardiographers and surgeons are
increasingly learning to work together in the so-called hybrid procedures. This seems to
be a global trend, particularly for valve diseases.</p>
