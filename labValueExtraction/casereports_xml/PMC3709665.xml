      <abstract>
        <p>We developed a new technique using hyaluronic gel injection as a spacer to safely move the esophagus away from the high-dose area during interstitial brachytherapy of a mediastinal target close to the esophagus. We percutaneously injected a high-molecular-weight hyaluronic gel mixed with contrast medium to create a space between the esophagus and the target during interstitial brachytherapy. We applied this technique to two cases of relapsed recurrent nerve lymph node metastasis from esophageal cancer: one refractory tumor after 50 Gy of radiotherapy, and one recurrence after mediastinal radiotherapy of total 64 Gy. We prescribed 20 Gy and 18 Gy in one fraction to each target, with calculated esophageal D<sub>2cc</sub> (the minimum dose to the most irradiated volume of 2 cc) of 4.0 Gy and 6.8 Gy, respectively. Calculated enhancement factor by gel shifting in equivalent dose was 2.69 and 2.34, respectively. In each patient, accumulated esophageal D<sub>1cc</sub> (minimum dose to the most irradiated volume of p cc. minimum dose to the most irradiated volume of 1 cc) was 74.4 Gy and 85.6 Gy without shifting, and 59.1 Gy and 37.6 Gy with shifting, respectively. There were no procedure-related complications. Four months after the brachytherapy, each tumor was remarkably diminished. No evidence of recurrences or late complications were observed 8 months and 9 months after the procedure, respectively. The esophageal gel-shifting technique may facilitate eradicative brachytherapy to upper mediastinal targets without damaging the esophagus, and can be used in conjunction with boost irradiation or reirradiation to overcome the problem of salvage failure.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Reirradiation or boost irradiation to a mediastinal target is frequently limited by the surrounding structures. The recurrent nerve lymph node (RNLN) is one of the most common sites of lymph node metastasis from thoracic esophageal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C1">1</xref>]. RNLN exists along the recurrent nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C1">2</xref>], and is the most common site of exclusive involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C3">3</xref>] and of micrometastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C4">4</xref>]. Prophylactic dissection of RNLN recently became considered as essential for curative esophagectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C5">5</xref>] but is not yet a well-established standard practice for unapparent nodal enlargement.</p>
      <p>Salvage treatments for RNLN relapse include chemotherapy, radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C6">6</xref>] and a second surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C4">4</xref>]. Recent reports show better results for high-dose salvage radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C7">7</xref>], but because the dose is often limited by surrounding at-risk organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C8">8</xref>], re-salvage for radiotherapy failure is problematic. Solo RNLN relapse after radiotherapy or refractory RNLN may be best treated with salvage surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C4">4</xref>], but this can only be performed in a limited number of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C9">9</xref>]. Although it is reported that reirradiation can be as effective as the initial treatment in other parts of the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C10">10</xref>], this method is commonly limited by the presence of surrounding normal tissue, including the esophagus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C11">11</xref>]. When the esophagus is postoperative, tolerance to radiation injury may be less than intact. In summary, postoperative RNLN metastasis relapse after radiotherapy or refractory to radiotherapy is a difficult problem.</p>
      <p>The radiotherapeutic techniques of image-guided radiation therapy&#x2013;intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IGRT-IMRT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C12">12</xref>] and/or brachytherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C13">13</xref>] provide advantages for preserving risk organs. In previous studies, we incorporated interventional techniques into high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy to enhance the preservation capacity for at-risk organs including the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C14">14</xref>], pharyngeal mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C13">13</xref>], small intestines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C16">16</xref>] and rectum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C18">18</xref>]. The risk organs were separated from the target by a space created by injection of hyaluronate gel. Here, we describe the application of this spacing technique to move the esophagus away from the mediastinal target in cases of relapsed and refractory RNLN metastasis. We treated two cases of relapsed RNLN from esophageal cancer: one with refractory left RNLN that continued to expand even after 50 Gy of salvage radiotherapy, and one with infield recurrence of the right RNLN after 64 Gy of salvage radiotherapy.</p>

        <title>Indications</title>
        <p>The indications for treatment were single exclusive refractory RNLN, and infield recurrence of RNLN after radiotherapy for initial postsurgical recurrence, in two patients for whom chemotherapy or surgery were no longer indicated. The feasibility of the treatment was evaluated after finding a safe route for percutaneous needle insertion for each patient's particular anatomical condition, as assessed by X-ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and confirmed by ultrasound examination. The risks and merits of the treatment were explained to the patients. Following confirmation of the patients' wishes for possible local control and according to their choice, we obtained consent from each patient prior to treatment. Standard institutional approval was given for the procedure. The entire procedure was performed at our outpatient clinic by physicians qualified in the fields of radiation oncology, interventional radiology and gastrointestinal surgery.</p>

        <title>Definition of RNLN</title>
        <p>RNLNs are defined as the lymph nodes that lie along the recurrent nerve in the thorax, which is between the upper border of the sternum and the upper border of the subclavian artery. They are further subdivided into the right, middle and left nodes (Japanese Classification of Esophageal Cancer) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C2">2</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2c">
        <title>Gel preparation</title>
        <p>A gel was prepared as a viscous mixture of 10 ml of hyaluronan (1 mg/ml; Suvenyl, Chugai/Roche, Tokyo, Japan) and 0.8 ml of contrast media (300 mg iodine/ml; Iopamiron, Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C17">17</xref>]. This volume was roughly estimated for an effective esophageal shifting from a target point.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2d">
        <title>Monitoring, premedication and patient setup</title>
        <p>The patients were monitored with electrocardiography and for P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, respiration and blood pressure throughout the procedure. To enable them to report any abnormal sensation, they underwent awake sedation with 25 mg of hydroxyzine pamoate until completion of needle deployment and gel injection. The patients were positioned supine on the CT couch.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2e">
        <title>Percutaneous needle insertion and gel injection</title>
        <p>Following local anesthesia of subcutaneous tissue with lidocaine and under ultrasound and CT guidance, a 21-gauge needle was inserted at a puncture point lateral to the trachea at the level of the upper edge of the sternum and advanced to the location for gel injection, with regard to the anatomic structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RRS137F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C19">19</xref>]. The needle penetrated the skin first; second, subcutaneous tissue (superficial cervical fascia, SCF) between both edges of the platysma in SCF; third, the relatively hard investing layer of deep cervical fascia (DCF) containing the suprasternal space (space of Burns) filled with adipose connective tissue and the transverse cervical vein (which is commonly kinked and plexiform, and should thus be avoided), and adipose tissue below this fascia; and fourth, the pretracheal layer of DCF over the peritracheal space continuous with paraesophageal adipose tissue. To advance the needle safely, we shifted the trachea by about 5&#x2013;10 mm manually to the right or left when necessary. Using this route, the needle passes medial to the sternohyoid and sternothyroid strap muscles to avoid the influence of muscle contraction on the needle. When the needle tip reached the predetermined injection point, we gently injected the gel to create a space, forcing the esophagus away from the target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C16">16</xref>]. We confirmed the created space and shifting effect by CT. When the effect became sufficient, the gel injection was terminated.

        <title>Needle deployment</title>
        <p>Under CT guidance, interstitial brachytherapy applicator steepled needles (Microselectron system; 1.3 mm in external diameter and 12 cm long) were inserted percutaneously and deployed in the target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C20">20</xref>]. Thin-slice (2 or 3 mm) CT images were acquired and transferred to the treatment planning computer.</p>

      <sec id="s2g">
        <title>CT-based treatment planning</title>
        <p>In order to determine contours of the target and at-risk organs on the planning CT images, we referred raw CT images taken before, during, and after gel injection, and reconstructed contours containing interpolated lines.</p>
        <p>A CT-based 3D treatment plan was created using a graphic optimization tool (PLATO version 14 or Oncentra Brachy; Nucletron, Veenendaal, the Netherlands). We aimed to prescribe 18&#x2013;20 Gy to 90% of the planning target volume (PTV). The PTV was equal to clinical target volume (CTV) as usual in interstitial brachytherapy, and the CTV was set equal to gross tumor volume (GTV) in the present solitary recurrent lesions of RNLN metastasis. We tentatively set our criteria for accumulated esophageal dose as D<sub>1cc</sub> less than 70 GyE<sub>LQ2, &#x3B1;/&#x3B2;=3</sub>, taking into account published tolerance dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C8">8</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2h">
        <title>Plan evaluation and irradiation</title>
        <p>We described biological equivalent dose as GyE<sub>LQ2, &#x3B1;/&#x3B2;=k</sub> for a 2-Gy fraction schedule calculated using the linear quadratic (LQ) model at &#x3B1;/&#x3B2; = k (instead of equivalent dose), in the widely used forms of GyE<sub>LQ2, &#x3B1;/&#x3B2;=3</sub> and GyE<sub>LQ2, &#x3B1;/&#x3B2;=10</sub>. D<sub><italic>p</italic> cc</sub> was defined as the minimum dose to the most irradiated volume of <italic>p</italic> cc. The planning data were transferred to an I-192 remote after-loader system (Microselectron HDR Ir-192, Nucletron), and irradiation was started.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2i">
        <title>Postirradiation care and follow-up</title>
        <p>The needles were removed immediately after completion of the irradiation, and the patient was discharged when ready. Each patient was regularly followed up at clinics.</p>

        <title>Case 1</title>
        <p>A 54-year-old male patient was referred for radiotherapy for a sole left RNLN metastasis. He had been diagnosed 1 year earlier with stage II, pT2N0M0 intrathoracic esophageal squamous cell cancer. He underwent thoracoscopic esophageal resection with lymph node dissection up to the second region, laparoscopic gastric tube creation and esophagogastric anastomosis in the posterior mediastinum followed by two cycles of chemotherapy, each consisting of 750 mg/m<sup>2</sup> 5-fluorouracil on Days 1&#x2013;5 and 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cisplatin on Day 1 (FP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C21">21</xref>]. He developed sepsis with <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>, <italic>Clostridium glabrata</italic>, <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus epidermis</italic>, which was treated with antibiotics (ciproxan 400 mg/day and micafungin 100 mg/day for 4 weeks). One month prior to referral, follow-up CT revealed a RNLN recurrence that was treated with 50 Gy of external beam radiotherapy delivered in 2-Gy fractions for 5 weeks (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RRS137F2">2</xref>A) and concomitant administration of one course of FP chemotherapy. However, fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) with X-ray CT study imaging 1 month after EBRT revealed persistent high FDG accumulation in the tumor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RRS137F2">2</xref>B). The patient desired boost treatment as soon as possible, and boost brachytherapy assisted by esophageal shifting was considered.

        <p>After injection of the prepared gel, pooling of the gel and its shifting effect were confirmed on CT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RRS137F3">3</xref>A, B). We prescribed 20.0 Gy in one fraction (50.0 GyE<sub>LQ2, &#x3B1;/&#x3B2;=10</sub>) to 90% of the PTV (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RRS137F4">4</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RRS137F5">5</xref>A), with D<sub>2cc</sub> of the shifted esophagus of 4.0 Gy (5.6 GyE<sub>LQ2, &#x3B1;/&#x3B2;=3</sub>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RRS137F5">5</xref>B). In a simulation without gel shifting, D<sub>2cc</sub> of the esophagus was calculated to be 7.3 Gy (15.0 GyE<sub>LQ2, &#x3B1;/&#x3B2;=3</sub>). The enhancement factor due to gel shifting was 2.69 (15.0/5.6) for D<sub>2cc</sub> and 2.69 (24.4/9.07) for D<sub>1cc</sub>. The previous dose to the involved esophagus for the D<sub>2cc</sub> area was 20 Gy. (The area involved for D<sub>2cc</sub> was estimated at the time of brachytherapy planning after gel injection.

Thus, the accumulated esophageal D<sub>2cc</sub> and D<sub>1cc</sub> values were 65.0 Gy and 74.4 Gy without gel shifting, which decreased to 55.6 Gy and 59.1 Gy, respectively, with gel injection.

        <title>Case 2</title>
        <p>A 73-year-old male patient with chronic cardiac dysfunction was referred for radiotherapy of a single metastasis to right RNLN. He had been diagnosed 3 years earlier with intrathoracic lower esophageal squamous cell cancer, and underwent esophagectomy with lower mediastinal and abdominal lymph nodal dissection under thoraco-laparotomy with left-sided intra-thoracic gastric tube reconstruction for stage IV, pT3N4M0. Lymph nodal dissection was not performed in the upper mediastinum because of underlying cardiac failure. Six months after the surgery, FDG-PET revealed lymph node relapse in the paraaortic and subcarinal region, and he received 64 Gy of external beam irradiation in 2-Gy fractions for 6 weeks and 4 days. Three months before the referral, right RNLN metastasis was detected close to the esophagus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RRS137F6">6</xref>A). Because this area had been involved in the previous prescribed field of 42 Gy, external beam retreatment was not considered.

        <p>The size of the tumor had continued to increase during the period until brachytherapy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RRS137F6">6</xref>B). The prepared gel was injected, and pooling of the gel and the shifting effect were confirmed on X-ray CT imaging (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RRS137F6">6</xref>C). We prescribed 18 Gy in one fraction (42.0 GyE<sub>LQ2, &#x3B1;/&#x3B2;=10</sub>) to 80% of the PTV volume (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RRS137F6">6</xref>D), with 16 Gy (60.8 GyE<sub>LQ2, &#x3B1;/&#x3B2;=3</sub>) of tracheal D<sub>2cc</sub> and 6.8 Gy (13.3 GyE<sub>LQ2, &#x3B1;/&#x3B2;=3</sub>) of esophageal D<sub>2cc</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RRS137F5">5</xref>A). The previous irradiated dose to the corresponding area was 20 Gy. In a simulation without gel shifting, D<sub>2cc</sub> of the esophagus was calculated as 15 Gy (31.3 GyE<sub>LQ2, &#x3B1;/&#x3B2;=3</sub>). The enhancement factor for gel shifting was calculated as 2.34 (31.3 GyE<sub>LQ2, &#x3B1;/&#x3B2;=3</sub>/13.3 GyE<sub>LQ2, &#x3B1;/&#x3B2;=3</sub>) for D<sub>2cc</sub>, and 3.72 (65.6 GyE<sub>LQ2, &#x3B1;/&#x3B2;=3</sub>/17.6 GyE<sub>LQ2, &#x3B1;/&#x3B2;=3</sub>) for D<sub>1cc</sub>. Thus, accumulated esophageal D<sub>2cc</sub> and D<sub>1cc</sub> were 51.3 Gy and 85.6 Gy without gel shifting, which decreased to 33.3 Gy and 37.6 Gy, respectively, after gel injection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RRS137F5">5</xref>B).</p>

        <p>Eight and 9 months have elapsed since the brachytherapy in Cases one and two, respectively. There were no immediate complications related to the procedure or treatment. No fever, appetite loss, abdominal pain or discomfort, renal dysfunction or neural symptoms have been observed so far in either patient. Imaging studies obtained 3 months (Case 1) and 4 months (Case 2) after brachytherapy treatment showed a remarkable reduction in tumor volume of the reirradiated target lesions in both cases (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RRS137F4">4</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RRS137F6">6</xref>E). Follow-up imaging studies at 8 months (Case 1) and 6 months (Case 2) showed no changes. There were no apparent relapses in other areas of the body; however, Case 2 suffered 2 months of pneumonia without the obvious symptoms usually seen in infectious pneumonia, and possibly caused by the external beam radiation therapy given 7&#x2013;8 months prior. The pneumonia jeopardized evaluation of the treatment effect on FDG-PET. The patients are still being followed up at the outpatient clinic and have perfect performance status.</p>

        <title>Reirradiation to a mediastinal target</title>
        <p>Reirradiation is becoming increasingly important in treatment of relapsed cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C10">10</xref>]. The clinical rationale for local eradicative treatment is thought to be high for oligometastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C22">22</xref>]. Zang <italic>et al.</italic> reported that chemoradiotherapy with dose &#x2265;60 Gy improved survival rates in loco-recurrent esophageal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C7">7</xref>]. Reirradiation to a mediastinal target, however, is commonly limited by the poor radiotolerance of at-risk organs such as the esophagus and spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C11">11</xref>].</p>

        <title>Feasibility of the present procedure in terms of possible patterns of RNLN metastasis</title>
        <p>Patterns in the management of RNLN are as follows: location on the left (Case one), right (Case two) or centrally (pretracheal); boost (Case 1) or reirradiation (Case two); after surgical nodal dissection (Case one) or intact (Case two). We treated only two patients, but most of the above possible patterns were encountered.</p>
        <p>Patients with RNLN relapse may have widespread nodal disease. Mizutani <italic>et al.</italic> reported abundant collateral routes in right RNLN by inspection of over 20 cadavers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C23">23</xref>]. It is thought to be important to treat a wider area and to maintain monitoring.</p>

      <sec id="s4c">
        <title>Anatomical advantage and safety concerns</title>
        <p>The present procedure takes advantage of the anatomical nature of this part of the esophagus, i.e., that it is generally unfixed and is not encased, which makes it an ideal candidate for shifting by gel injection. In each case presented here, the esophagus was easily shifted away from the target RNLN, resulting in a doubling of radiation safety parameters.</p>
        <p>In this technique, the needle follows a short and narrow path through the space of Burns, which contains the kinked transverse cervical vein. Although care must be taken to avoid bleeding during insertion, the needle is not affected by muscle tension. When surgical lymph node dissection has been performed, as in Case 1, this vein is commonly removed.</p>
        <p>Another risk is injury to the recurrent nerve. We minimized this risk by using awake sedation so that voice function could be checked throughout the procedure, and by avoiding the use of local anesthesia near the nerve.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s4d">
        <title>Treatment dose</title>
        <p>As yet there are no dedicated reports regarding desirable reirradiation dose for metastatic lymph nodes from esophageal cancer. Dose&#x2013;response relationships in reirradiation are generally thought to be similar to (or not inferior to) those in the first radiotherapy, for various tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C10">10</xref>]. Thus, 60 Gy equivalent or more may be preferable if this is safely applicable. When such a high target dose cannot be prescribed safely, there is the possible advantage of subvolume effect in the center of the tumor if interstitial brachytherapy is performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C24">24</xref>]. Moreover, Ruggieri <italic>et al.</italic> reported that severely hypofractionated radiotherapy may overcome hypoxic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C25">25</xref>]; we would expect this advantage to also apply to boost brachytherapy. Further accumulation of data is required to explore this subtheme.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s4e">
        <title>Dose to at-risk organ</title>
        <p>There are no common criteria for safe and effective reirradiation. In brachytherapy reirradiation (and also in similar types of spot reirradiation), only a part of the critical organ is reirradiated nonuniformly. Although we tentatively set a criterion with D<sub>1cc</sub> for the esophagus, this was highly speculative; in addition, we have little clinical experience of our own in this regard. The information we used for reference was TD5/5 (dose for 5% esophageal stricture/perforation event in 5 years) for irradiation involving one-third of the esophagus of 60 Gy, and TD50/5 of 68&#x2013;72 Gy [8]; it is also hypothesized that less partial involvement appears to cause fewer adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C26">26</xref>]. Based on our clinical experience, in which we used and observed tentative safety criteria with D<sub>2cc</sub> for surgically intact small intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C16">16</xref>], rectum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C18">18</xref>] and skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C13">13</xref>], we did not see overt late damage; however, these findings require continued assessment, and those for tracheal and anastomotic sites require further discussion.</p>

        <p>Native-type hyaluronan exists widely in the body as an innate substance and is metabolized promptly. Hyaluronan is a ligand to cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and a receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility to facilitate cellular migration, proliferation and invasion. This may induce enhancement effects on some tumors and may not be beneficial if it is mixed with tumor cells. For this reason, the injection should be limited to the surrounding space and not penetrate the tumor. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> research found that initiation of migration takes more than 8 h (unpublished data); therefore, the presently described procedure will have no negative effect on tumor control because single-session eradicative brachytherapy is completed within a few hours. Also worthy of consideration is that CD44 is a potent stimulant of T-cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RRS137C27">27</xref>]. Immune-potentiation by this method may merit further investigation.</p>

      <title>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>We aimed to establish a basic methodology for safe salvage boost radiation or reirradiation procedure to mediastinal lymph nodes, which are typically RNLN, using hyaluronate gel injection to shift the esophagus away from the target. In two clinical cases of reirradiation to PNLN metastasis, gel shifting was performed via the space of Burns, resulting in a successful decrease in esophageal D<sub>1cc</sub> and no procedural complications. Follow-up imaging studies obtained 4 months after the procedure showed a reduction in the size of the irradiated tumor.</p>
      <p>We consider that the esophageal gel-shifting technique facilitates safe and eradicative reirradiation or boost irradiation to PNLN recurrence.</p>
