      <title>Background</title>
      <p>There are many causes of sellar and suprasellar mass, and pituitary enlargment secondary to primary hypothyroidism has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It results from the loss of thyroxine feedback inhibition and the subsequent overproduction of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Despite recent progress in imaging techniques, it is not possible to distinguish between TSH-producing macroadenoma and hyperplasia of pituitary thyrotroph cells on CT and MR scans. In such cases, repeat MRI after therapy with thyroxine may provide a definitive diagnosis and eliminate unnecessary surgery: unlike adenoma, pituitary hyperplasia resolves after thyroid hormone replacement therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p>

        <title>History and Physical Examination</title>
        <p>A 10 year old boy, born at term in Morocco from non-consanguineous parents after an uncomplicated pregnancy, presented at his local hospital with occipital headache over the last three months and height growth arrest: during the previous 2 years he had grown 1 cm, declining from the 75-90<sup>th </sup>percentile to the 25<sup>th</sup>, while his weight had passed from the 50<sup>th </sup>to the 75<sup>th </sup>percentile in the last year. He did not complain of vomiting, tiredness or any other symptoms.</p>
        <p>His past and familial history was unremarkable and his cognitive development normal. On physical examination, he presented with height 136 cm (25<sup>th </sup>percentile), weight 42 kg (75<sup>th </sup>percentile), prepubertal status, blood pressure 120/67 mmHg, pulse rate 72 bpm, and non-palpable thyroid gland. Because of persistent headache he was referred to the neurologist at his local hospital and the examination was normal, as were the <italic>fundus oculi </italic>and visual fields.</p>

        <title>Radiographic and laboratory data</title>
        <p>Cranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was performed to rule out an organic lesion and an intrasellar and suprasellar pituitary mass was detected. The enlargment was isointense to gray matter, extended on the suprasellar cistern with mild compression of the optic chiasm. The pituitary stalk and posterior pituitary were dislocated. After gadolinium the mass homogeneously enhanced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p>

Pretreatment sagittal (A, B) and coronal (C-E) T1-weighted MR images show diffuse enlagement of the pituitary gland, that extends into the suprasellar cystern with mild compression of the optic chiasm and of the posterior neurohypophyseal lobe, which keeps its normal bright signal</bold>. After intravenous Gadolinum administration (B, D) the mass demonstrate homogeneous enhancement; the pituitary stalk (E) is raised but still along the midline.</p>

        <p>After endocrine consultation, blood tests were done: full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, renal and liver function and anti-coeliac screening were</p>
        <p>Thyroid ultrasound revealed normal thyroid size, with markedly heterogeneous echo texture and hypo-echoic areas. The color Doppler study revealed diffuse hypervascolarization of the gland. The picture was consistent with late-stage chronic thyroiditis. Based on clinical history and laboratory data, a diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism consequent to chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis was made and the pituitary mass was attributed to secondary hyperplasia. The patient was started on levothyroxine at 50 ug/day. IGF-I and thyroid function had returned to the normal range after 3 months (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Height growth velocity increased (7 cm/year) and at the last visit, at 11 years, the boy's height was on the 50<sup>th </sup>percentile and he was no longer complaining of headache. A follow-up MRI scan 5 months after levothyroxine replacement showed resolution of the mass effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Due to the loss of thyroxine feedback inhibition and the subsequent overproduction of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), long-standing hypothyroidism results in hyperplasia of the thyrotroph cells and subsequent enlargement of the pituitary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The incidence of pituitary hyperplasia in patients with hypothyroidism varies from 25% to 81% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], high incidence (70%) is reported in patients with TSH levels &#x2265;50 &#x3BC;IU/m 8 l [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Because TRH also has a weak stimulatory effect on lactotroph cells, mild to moderate hyperprolactinemia may also occur in about three-quarters of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Nevertheless in our patient the slight increase in prolactin was probably due to the compression of the infundibulum by the mass, rather than to lactotroph hyperplasia.</p>
      <p>Children with pituitary hyperplasia and primary hypothyroidism rarely present with neurological symptoms secondary to sellar expansion (3%). Their complaints at presentation are associated with hypothyroidism and abnormal puberty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Most children present with symptoms of growth arrest due to primary hypothyroidism, and growth hormone (GH) production may be decreased because thyroxine is one of the factors stimulating GH synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Long-standing primary hypothyroidism may also lead to irreversible pituitary injury, which can lead to a deficiency in one or more pituitary hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Therefore in our patient persistent headache has to be attributed to hypothyroidism, even if the exact mechanism is not clear. Moreover reduced IGF-1 was probably secondary to transitory reduced GH synthesis.</p>
      <p>Despite recent progress in imaging, it is still difficult to distinguish between a pituitary adenoma and hyperplasia, even using MRI with gadolinium injection. On imaging studies, secondary pituitary hyperplasia is often characterized by a homogeneously enhancing lesion that may progress rapidly following the onset of a hypothyroid state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Interpretation of a pituitary mass without an endocrine investigation can lead to unnecessary surgery which can cause irreversible complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Differential diagnosis with TSH secreting adenoma can be made by means of inappropriatey normal/high range values of T3 and T4. Nevertheless the sequence and time course of hypothyroidism and pituitary hyperplasia have not been clarified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Concomitant diagnosis of hypothyroidism and pituitary hyperplasia are described in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], but two additional scenarios have been reported: a) normal thryoid function may be found in patients with a pituitary mass revealed by MR imaging. Re-examination a few weeks later is recommended because initial normal thyroid function may mask the diagnosis of hypothyroidism-related pituitary hyperplasia in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]; b) in other patients rapid progression of hyperplasia may develop after hypothyroidism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p>
      <p>Thyroid hormone replacement therapy led to a decrease in the size of the gland in 85% of patients with pituitary enlargement who underwent follow-up MR examinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Surgery should be reserved for decompression of the optic chiasm or to obtain a pathological diagnosis in the case of a pituitary mass which does not respond to, or worsens under, thyroid hormone replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In our patient, baseline thyroid function tests were consistent with primary hypothyroidism secondary to chronic autoimmune thyroiditis and repeat pituitary MRI after 5 months of levothyroxine therapy revealed complete regression of the pituitary mass. Based on the combined clinical findings, hormonal studies, and repeat MRI findings, the diagnosis of pituitary hyperplasia secondary to primary autoimmune hypothyroidism was made.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Primary hypothyroidism should be considered in the differential diagnosis of solid mass lesions of the pituitary gland, particularly in children with short stature. Examination of thyroid function in patients with sellar and suprasellar masses revealed by MR imaging may avoid unnecessary operations.</p>
