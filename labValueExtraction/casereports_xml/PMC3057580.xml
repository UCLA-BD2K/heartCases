      <abstract>
        <p>A woman suffered from massive blunt injuries in a motor vehicle accident at a presumed 4 weeks' gestation, but she successfully carried the fetus for an additional 29 weeks. Premature labor began at 33 weeks' gestation and a live 1,890 g male was delivered. His development was normal for the 12-months postnatal follow-up period. The patient remained in a persistent vegetative state. Only 12 cases of severely brain-injured pregnant patients who delivered babies have been reported in English literature. Such patients need special maternal and fetal monitoring. As shown in our patient, successful fetal outcome could be obtained in a mother who suffered from hypovolemic shock and diffuse axonal injury, was treated with numerous medications from 4 weeks' gestation, and survived premature labor at 33 weeks' gestation in a persistent vegetative state. This report represents the longest interval from maternal vegetative state to obstetric delivery. From our case, it would seem that no clear limit exists that restricts the physician's ability to support a severely injured pregnant patient.</p>
