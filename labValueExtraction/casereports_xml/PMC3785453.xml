      <abstract>
        <p>Over two dozen mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule associated protein tau cause a variety of neurodegenerative dementias known as tauopathies, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD), PSP, CBD and Pick's disease. The vast majority of these mutations map to the C-terminal region of tau possessing microtubule assembly and microtubule dynamics regulatory activities as well as the ability to promote pathological tau aggregation. Here, we describe a novel and non-conservative tau mutation (G55R) mapping to an alternatively spliced exon encoding part of the N-terminal region of the protein in a patient with the behavioral variant of FTD. Although less well understood than the C-terminal region of tau, the N-terminal region can influence both MT mediated effects as well as tau aggregation. The mutation changes an uncharged glycine to a basic arginine in the midst of a highly conserved and very acidic region. In vitro, 4-repeat G55R tau nucleates microtubule assembly more effectively than wild-type 4-repeat tau; surprisingly, this effect is tau isoform specific and is not observed in a 3-repeat G55R tau versus 3-repeat wild-type tau comparison. In contrast, the G55R mutation has no effect upon the abilities of tau to regulate MT growing and shortening dynamics or to aggregate. Additionally, the mutation has no effect upon kinesin translocation in a microtubule gliding assay. Together, (i) we have identified a novel tau mutation mapping to a mutation deficient region of the protein in a bvFTD patient, and (ii) the G55R mutation affects the ability of tau to nucleate microtubule assembly in vitro in a 4-repeat tau isoform specific manner. This altered capability could markedly affect in vivo microtubule function and neuronal cell biology. We consider G55R to be a candidate mutation for bvFTD since additional criteria required to establish causality are not yet available for assessment.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes. It is the second most common cause of dementia in patients under 65 years of age, after Alzheimer's disease (AD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-CohnHokke1">[1]</xref>). The age of onset of FTD is usually between 45 and 65 years, although 10% of patients have an onset beyond 70 years of age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Seelaar1">[2]</xref>. Familial forms of FTD occur in 30&#x2013;50% of cases, presenting as three distinct phenotypes known as (i) behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), (ii) semantic dementia (SD) and (iii) progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Rohrer1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Rohrer2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Ferrari1">[5]</xref>. The clinical characteristics of these illnesses are diverse, including loss of social skills, apathy, disinhibition, repetitive and compulsive behaviors, progressive inability to represent the self and others, loss of word meaning and the inability to express oneself. Parkinsonian signs are common, but typically emerge at a later stage of the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Neary1">[6]</xref>. The behavioral variant form of FTD manifests itself typically by disinhibition, compulsive or perseverative behavior, and apathy with emotional bluntness. MRI scans generally reveal gray matter loss, particularly in the anterior and medial temporal lobes, with less involvement of the parietal lobes, and typically no involvement of the cingulate gyrus or precuneus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Whitwell1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Of the 30&#x2013;50% of FTD patients with a family history, approximately 10% exhibit an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Goedert1">[8]</xref>. Mutations in seven genes can cause dominantly inherited FTD<italic>: MAPT, GRN, TARDBP, FUS, VCP, CHMP2B and C9ORF72</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Rademakers1">[9]</xref>. The most common mutations occur in <italic>MAPT, PGRN and C9ORF72</italic>. However, more than 50% of the familial patients with FTD are not accounted for by any of these known disease genes.</p>
      <p>Two types of mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule associated protein tau (<italic>MAPT</italic>) have been linked to FTD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Clark1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Hutton1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Spillantini1">[12]</xref>. The first type is missense mutations that alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded tau protein. In contrast, the second type of <italic>MAPT</italic> mutations alters the pattern of tau alternative RNA splicing. Although most of these mutations are intronic and map to the splice junctions on either side of exon 10 (encoding part of the MT binding region of the protein; see below for details) and therefore do not affect the tau amino acid sequence itself, some exonic mutations alter both amino acid sequence and the pattern of alternative splicing. Thus, the genetics indicate that alterations in either tau structure-function or the regulation of tau alternative splicing can cause FTD. Interestingly, all three forms of FTD can be caused by <italic>MAPT</italic> mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Galimberti1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In order to gain insights into possible molecular mechanisms of pathological tau action, one must first consider normal tau action as well as its structure-function relationship. Tau is essential for the development and maintenance of the nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Caceres1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-EsmaeliAzad1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Mandelkow1">[16]</xref>. Among its many roles is to regulate the growing and shortening dynamics of microtubules (MTs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Drechsel1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Trinczek1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Panda1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Bunker1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Levy1">[21]</xref>), cytoskeletal polymers composed of tubulin dimer subunits that serve many essential cellular functions. MTs are especially important in highly elongated neuronal axons, where they assemble into parallel bundles that contribute to the establishment and maintenance of axonal morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Conde1">[22]</xref> and also serve as tracks for axonal transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Duncan1">[23]</xref>. In addition, tau is an important mediator of signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Lee1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Ittner1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Roberson1">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Tau can be viewed as possessing three distinct structure-function regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076409-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The best-characterized region is the MT binding region, which possesses either three or four imperfect repeats separated from one another by shorter inter-repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Trinczek1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Lee2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Lee3">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Butner1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Goode1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Goode2">[31]</xref>. The distinction between 4-repeat (4R) tau and 3-repeat (3R) tau is determined by the inclusion or exclusion of exon 10 encoded sequences, determined by alternative tau RNA splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Himmler1">[32]</xref>. In addition to MT binding capability, this region of tau also possesses inherent MT assembly promoting activity and the ability to regulate MT growing and shortening dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Drechsel1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Trinczek1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Panda1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Bunker1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Levy1">[21]</xref>. Generally speaking, 4R tau is a more potent mediator of these activities than is 3R tau <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Trinczek1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Goode1">[30]</xref>. Importantly, this same region of tau has also been implicated in promoting pathological tau aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Gamblin1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Barghorn1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Combs1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Wolfe1">[36]</xref>.</p>

      <p>On the N-terminal side of the MT binding region is a region known as the &#x201C;projection domain&#x201D; because it projects outward from the MT surface and determines the spacing between parallel, bundled MTs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Chen1">[37]</xref>. This region also serves (i) to indirectly influence the ability of the MT binding region to perform its microtubule-related functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Trinczek1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Butner1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Goode1">[30]</xref>, (ii) to self-aggregate in disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-King1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Zhong1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Carmel1">[40]</xref>, (iii) to mediate the association of tau with membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Brandt1">[41]</xref> and (iv) various roles in signaling, most notably as a substrate for kinases and phosphatases including the tyrosine kinase fyn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Ballatore1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Goedert2">[43]</xref>. Further, this region has also been implicated in mediating tau dimerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Makrides1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Rosenberg1">[45]</xref>. Of particular relevance to the work presented here, the projection domain contains zero, one or two inserts (29 amino acids each) encoded by exons 2 and 3 as a result of alternative tau RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076409-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Himmler2">[46]</xref>). However, the functional differences between these three different tau isoforms (generally denoted as 0N, 1N or 2N, respectively) are poorly understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Goedert3">[47]</xref>. With respect to aggregation, 0N isoforms generally are less aggregation prone than longer isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-King1">[38]</xref>, and exon 2 in particular appears to increase aggregation propensity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Zhong1">[39]</xref>. Finally, the C-terminal tail of tau is located downstream of the MT binding region of tau. It is relatively short and is not well understood functionally. However, it can regulate tau binding to MTs indirectly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Trinczek1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Goode1">[30]</xref>, likely at least in part via regulated phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Dolan1">[48]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Approximately 80% of the missense tau mutations causing FTD and/or related dementias such as PSP, CBD or Pick's disease map to the MT binding region, including many in the alternatively spliced exon 10 encoded sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Kwon1">[49]</xref>. These mutations generally cause loss-of-function effects on the abilities of tau to bind MTs, promote MT assembly and regulate MT dynamics (for example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Hong1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Bunker2">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-LeBoeuf1">[52]</xref>). Indeed, recent work demonstrating that MT stabilizing drugs such as taxol and epothilone D can reverse A&#xDF; mediated deficits in cultured neurons and disease symptoms in mouse models of Alzheimer's provide important support for this loss-of-function perspective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Michaelis1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Brunden1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Zhang1">[55]</xref>. However, many of these same mutations also increase the tendency of tau to form pathological oligomers and/or aggregates, consistent with a gain-of-toxic function perspective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Gamblin1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Barghorn1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Combs1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Wolfe1">[36]</xref>. It is important to note that these different perspectives need not be mutually exclusive.</p>
      <p>There are five known tau missense mutations causing FTD or related dementias that map outside of the MT binding region of the protein. Two of these map to the extreme N-terminal end of the projection domain (R5H,R5L; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Hayashi1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Poorkaj1">[57]</xref>) while the other three map to the C-terminal tail (K369I, G389R, R406W; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Rizzu1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Goedert4">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Neumann1">[60]</xref>). The mechanistic effects of these mutations are poorly understood, especially the two mutations in the N-terminal projection domain. On the other hand, it has been speculated that the three mutations mapping to the C-terminal end of the protein might act indirectly by altering the ability of tau to serve as a substrate for regulatory kinases and/or phosphatases acting on amino acids mapping near to the mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Bunker2">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Delobel1">[61]</xref>. Interestingly, no known tau mutations (prior to this work) map to the alternatively spliced exon 2 or exon 3 encoded sequences in the N-terminal region of the protein; this is in marked contrast to the many mutations mapping to the alternatively spliced exon 10 encoded sequences residing within the MT binding region of the protein.</p>
      <p>Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a new tau mutation, G55R in a patient with bvFTD. G55R maps to exon 2, which encodes one of the two alternatively spliced inserts in the N-terminal region of the protein. In vitro analyses indicate that tau proteins bearing this substitution mutation promote more effective nucleation of new MTs when compared to WT tau, but only in the 4-repeat, adult specific tau context. This effect could significantly affect the regulation of MT action in adult neuronal cells. Thus, increased nucleation activity in 4R tau could underlie or contribute to pathological mechanisms associated with the G55R mutation. Identification of this novel candidate <italic>MAPT</italic> mutation, located in the N-terminal region of the tau protein, expands our understanding of tau molecular architecture and could contribute to the development of improved diagnostic and treatment strategies.</p>

The G55R mutation was absent in a group of 150 neurologically healthy subjects, aged &gt;65 years, as well as in a group of 152 patients with clinically diagnosed familial and sporadic FTD. In the FTD group, two patients with the previously observed P301L mutation and one with the previously observed S305N mutation in the <italic>MAPT</italic> gene were also identified.

      <p>Although the genetic evidence is incomplete, the family tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076409-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) suggests a direct transmission of the disease from the proband's father, who exhibited similar symptoms of dementia and died in a nursing home from &#x201C;general atherosclerosis&#x201D; at the age of 76 years. The proband's sister (II:3) was a resident of a facility for people with mental disorders and required constant care. She died at the age of 50, most likely after years of dementia. The patient's brother (II:2) committed suicide at the age of 50 years and may or may not have also been affected. The proband has four children, two of whom carry the mutation (III:1, III:2), but they are not yet old enough to exhibit clinical symptoms.

        <title>I. Clinical Case Report</title>
        <p>A 55 year old, right-handed woman with elementary school education (8 years) reported three years of progressive behavior problems. Her medical history included ovarian cancer at age 49, resulting in removal of her uterus and its appendages. She was severely nicotine dependent. Her family reported that she had previously been sociable, jovial and enthusiastic. Subsequently, she became secretive, highly sensitive and suspicious along with the loss of the ability to perform routine functions. She also exhibited reduced appetite and became underweight (BMI 17). Gradually, she lost interest in daily activities, including watching television, meeting friends and walking, isolating herself from her environment. A problem with cutlery use occurred and gradually severe apraxia developed. She lost the ability to verbally express herself correctly and presented severe memory impairment. Anxiety, helplessness and sleep disturbances were also reported.</p>
        <p>The patient was admitted to the psychiatric unit at a general hospital in December 2010. During this hospitalization, the patient exhibited anxiety and general disorientation. Limb and optical apraxia were observed. The patient experienced severe difficulty with word selection and speech (alogia, dysnomia, paraphrasia, and agrammatism). She expressed herself unclearly and indirectly, presenting a lack of insight and periodic verbal aggression. Psychotic symptoms were not observed. The patient spent most of her time pacing aimlessly through the ward. She also exhibited sleep and appetite disturbances. Clinical assessment revealed a MMSE score of 10 and a GDS score (Geriatric Depression Scale) of 8. At this point, she was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD).</p>
        <p>Seven months later, during a second hospitalization in the Neurology Clinic of the CSK MSWiA Hospital, the patient's condition was more advanced. She was withdrawn, exhibited reduced mobility, spent most of her time in bed (sitting or lying) and left her room only to smoke or use the rest room facilities (accompanied by her son). Her verbal expression was limited to partial, non-relevant answers to questions. She was very anxious and agitated when left alone. No verbal or physical aggression or psychotic disturbances were observed. A neurological examination revealed no abnormalities. On the other hand, neuroimaging analyses revealed generalized atrophy, located mostly in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes, without ventricular enlargement and focal pathological changes. Neuropsychological testing was not possible because the patient's cognitive losses were too advanced (MMSE&#x200A;=&#x200A;7). Co-operation during testing was impaired, caused by anxiety and agitation. She did not respond to questions, did not follow instructions and showed no involvement or interest in the requested tasks.</p>
        <p>Ten months later, during a third clinical evaluation, the patient's condition had clearly deteriorated further. However, she was able to move on her own, albeit unsteadily. Her general mood was elevated. The patient had a tendency to shorten the distance between her and other people e.g. she tried to pinch medical personnel during examinations. Echolalia and confusion were observed. She was completely disoriented regarding place and time, and knew only her first and last names. She did not recognize her close relatives, claiming they were her friends. A clear helplessness was apparent. According to her daughters-in-law, she was not taking care of her personal hygiene, and did not want to bathe or to be washed. She did not use everyday items and was not able to dress herself. She often moved personal possessions from one shelf to another or hid them in strange places. From time to time, she showed verbal aggression. She occasionally had groundless, unexpected episodes of laughing. Her appetite was good but she was still losing weight (BMI 18). Her grade on a Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) was 6/7.</p>
        <p>Based on the above observations, the patient was diagnosed with early-onset, familial frontotemporal dementia (behavioral variant) without parkinsonism.</p>

        <title>II. Molecular Analyses of G55R Tau</title>
        <p>In the absence of more definitive genetic evidence, the G55R mutation must be designated at the present time as a candidate FTD mutation. However, bioinformatics approaches support the notion that the G55R mutation may cause tau dysfunction and therefore underlie the FTD symptoms. The G55R mutation changes an uncharged glycine residue into a basic arginine residue in the midst of a highly acidic region of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076409-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Additionally, analysis using the ConSurf (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://consurf.tau.ac.il">http://consurf.tau.ac.il</ext-link>), SIFT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg">http://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg</ext-link>) and BLAST programs demonstrated that the G55 residue is highly conserved in evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076409-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and that it is likely to be exposed on the surface of the protein, consistent with the unfolded nature of tau <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Mandelkow2">[71]</xref>. According to criteria proposed by Cotton and Scriver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Cotton1">[72]</xref> and Antonarakis and Cooper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Antonarakis1">[73]</xref>, it is highly probable that G55R is a pathogenic variant of tau.

Taken together, it is very possible that this G/R substitution could have marked structure-function effects, perhaps altering intra-molecular and/or inter-molecular interactions.</p>

          <title>The G55R Mutation Increases the Ability of Tau to Nucleate Microtubule Assembly in 4R Tau but not 3R Tau</title>
          <p>Tau action on MTs is the best characterized aspect of tau biochemistry. Therefore, our first efforts to characterize the effects of the G55R mutation were to compare the abilities of G55R tau and WT tau to promote MT assembly in vitro using a standard light scattering assay. We utilized &#x201C;unseeded&#x201D; reactions, which require tau to first nucleate new MTs and to then elongate them. The slope of the initial rise in light scattering is an indication of the efficiency of MT nucleation while the plateau level is a first approximation of the overall quantity of MTs assembled at steady state.</p>
          <p>As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076409-g003">Figure 3</xref> (panel A), the light scattering plots indicate that 4R G55R mutant tau nucleates and assembles MTs more effectively than does 4R WT tau. Quantitatively, the slope of the initial rise for the 4R G55R mutant tau plot (0.069&#xB1;0.003 abs/min) is 32% steeper than the 4R WT tau control plot (0.047&#xB1;0.006 abs/min; P&#x200A;=&#x200A;0.035) and the plateau level for the 4R G55R mutant tau is &#x223C;14% higher than for 4R WT tau (P&#x200A;=&#x200A;0.0244). In contrast, the light scattering plots for 3R G55R tau and 3R WT tau are indistinguishable. Although perhaps surprising at first glance, there are other examples of tau mutations exhibiting differential effects in 4R tau versus 3R tau contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Hogg1">[75]</xref>.</p>

          <p>Since the plateau level achieved in a light scattering MT assembly assay can be affected by both the number of MTs in a sample as well as the MT length distribution, we sought to independently assess the amount of MT mass assembled in each reaction shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076409-g003">Figure 3A</xref>. Therefore, once steady-state had been achieved in the MT assembly assays (60 mins), aliquots were harvested from each reaction and subjected to co-sedimentation assays. Each sample was centrifuged through a sucrose cushion to pellet the MTs (and any bound tau) while leaving non-polymerized tubulin and non-MT bound tau in the supernatant. The amount of tubulin in each fraction was then determined by quantitative SDS-PAGE. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076409-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, both 3R G55R tau and 4R G55R tau polymerize the same amount of MT mass as their corresponding WT tau proteins. Although the 4R G55R tau sample has a slightly greater amount of MT mass than 4R WT tau, this slight increase is not statistically significant. Additionally, the vast majority of tau in each case is MT bound. Taken together with the increased nucleation capability of 4R G55R demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076409-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, the simplest interpretation of the data is that 4R G55R tau nucleates a greater number of MTs than 4R WT tau but that the resulting MTs are shorter than those synthesized by 4R WT tau. This leads to the accumulation of the same overall MT mass and is the logical outcome of increased nucleation activity in an in vitro reaction with a finite quantity of tubulin subunits. In contrast, mutant 3R G55R tau and 3R WT tau exhibit the same levels of MT nucleation and assembly activities.</p>
          <p>To independently assess these conclusions, we next determined the length distribution of the MTs in each reaction at steady state using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076409-g004">Figure 4</xref>, the mean length of MTs assembled by 4R G55R is 7.73 &#xB5;m while 4R WT tau assembled MTs have a mean length of 9.30 &#xB5;m, a statistically significant 17% difference (P&#x200A;=&#x200A;0.001). In contrast, the mean length of 3R G55R tau MTs (10.13 &#xB5;m) was statistically indistinguishable from 3R WT tau MTs (mean length &#x200A;=&#x200A;10.23 &#xB5;m). Taken together with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076409-g003">Figure 3</xref>, these data corroborate the conclusion that the G55R mutation leads to increased MT nucleation activity in the 4R tau context, leading to the assembly of a greater number of MTs than 4R WT tau, although they have a shorter average length. In contrast, G55R has no effect on MT nucleation or average MT length in the 3R tau context.</p>

          <title>The G55R Tau Mutation Does Not Affect the Ability of Either 4R Tau or 3R Tau to Regulate MT Dynamics or the Kinesin-MT Interaction</title>
          <p>We next asked if the G55R mutation affected the ability of tau to regulate MT dynamics at steady-state using a standard in vitro MT dynamics assay system. We compared 4R G55R tau to 4R WT tau and 3R G55R tau to 3R WT tau for their abilities to affect MT growth and shortening rates, lengths of growing and shortening events, the durations of growth, shortening and attenuation (pause) events, the frequency of catastrophe and rescue events and overall dynamicity. Although there were some minor effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076409.s004">Table S1</xref>), these did not reach statistical significance. The overall conclusion is that the G55R mutation does not have a marked effect upon the ability of tau to regulate MT dynamics. This conclusion is consistent with the MT assembly data derived above, since these MT dynamics assays use axoneme seeds to nucleate MT growth and therefore assess growing and shortening behaviors but not nucleation.</p>
          <p>We next asked if the G55R mutation might affect the ability of tau-assembled MTs to interact with kinesin, the major axonal transport motor protein carrying cargo from neuronal cell bodies down the length of axons. We used standard kinesin-driven MT gliding assays to assess MTs assembled at tau:tubulin molar ratios of 1&#x2236;20, 1&#x2236;30 and 1&#x2236;60, and as seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076409.s002">Figure S2</xref>, the gliding rates showed that G55R tau and WT tau assembled MTs behave indistinguishably from one another, in both 4R tau and 3R tau contexts.</p>

          <title>The G55R Tau Mutation Does Not Affect The Ability of Either 4R Tau or 3R Tau to Aggregate</title>
          <p>Since tau aggregation is a central feature of tau pathology, we next asked if the G55R mutation affected the ability of tau to aggregate using a standard aggregation assay. Tau aggregation was induced by the addition of arachidonic acid. Following incubation, the samples were fixed and examined by transmission electron microscopy. Aggregate number, aggregate size and total aggregate area were quantitated. Although there were occasional trends, there were no statistically significant differences between 4R G55R tau and 4R WT tau or between 3R G55R tau and 3R WT tau. Representative TEM images and data for total aggregate area per field are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0076409.s003">Figure S3</xref>. (Data for aggregate number and aggregate size are not shown.) Although it is possible that a different inducer (such as heparin) might yield different results, or that a kinetic analysis might reveal differences in the rate of aggregation, these data suggest that the G55R mutation does not alter the ability of tau to aggregate.</p>
          <p>These observations are consistent with our AGGRESCAN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinf.uab.es/aggrescan/">http://bioinf.uab.es/aggrescan/</ext-link>) software analyses that identify putatively aggregation-prone regions in proteins. Our analyses revealed that the G55R mutation resulted in a negligible shift of a3v SA value (&#x2212;0.331 vs. &#x2212;0.332), which is an indicator of the amino acid aggregation-propensity value of the entire region. Additionally, position 55 was not identified as a hot spot for aggregation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have described a patient with the behavioral variant of FTD and a novel mutation (G55R) located in the alternatively spliced exon 2 of the <italic>MAPT</italic> gene, in the H1x haplotype background. This is the first tau mutation mapped to either of the two amino end tau exons (exons 2 and 3).</p>
      <p>At this point in time, we consider G55R as a candidate gene for FTD because we cannot yet rigorously assess all requisite criteria required to establish causality. This follows from the facts that (i) DNA for genetic analyses of the proband's father and two siblings (all deceased) is not available, (ii) the proband is still alive and no brain tissue samples are available for immunocytochemistry and (iii) the proband's two sons carrying the G55R mutation are not yet of sufficient age to begin exhibiting symptoms. On the other hand, we believe that considerable evidence does exist to support the assertion that G55R tau is a very strong candidate to be causal for bvFTD. This includes the facts that (i) the dementia phenotype is inherited in a manner consistent with a simple dominant pattern of inheritance, consistent with other tau mutations causing FTD, (ii) the G55R mutation occurs at a very highly conserved position in tau, and the adjoining regions of tau are also very highly conserved, (iii) the glycine to arginine substitution changes an uncharged amino acid into a positively charged amino acid, right in the midst of a very negatively charged region of the protein, and (iv) the G55R mutation alters the ability of tau to nucleate MT assembly, one of the most important functions of the protein. Indeed, according to the Guerreiro algorithm (used to assess AD-causing mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Guerreiro1">[74]</xref>), the G55R mutation would be classified as &#x201C;probable pathogenic&#x201D;. Using criteria proposed by Cotton and Scriver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Cotton1">[72]</xref> and Antonarakis and Cooper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Antonarakis1">[73]</xref>, G55R would be highly probable to be a pathogenic variant.</p>

        <title>A New Candidate Tau Mutation for Frontotemporal Dementia</title>
        <p>Despite the fact that the proband was diagnosed in an advanced stage of the disease, she met the stringent clinical criteria for probable bvFTD. She showed progressive deterioration of behavior and cognition and frontal and temporal atrophy by neuroimaging (MRI). The clinical phenotype of the G55R proband is significantly different from the phenotypes connected with the nearby R5L and R5H mutations that cause progressive supranuclear palsy and typical FTD, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Hayashi1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Poorkaj1">[57]</xref>. Additionally, the proband did not demonstrate any motor symptoms typical for CBD such as alien limb or myoclonus.</p>
        <p>While the vast majority of tau mutations causing dementia map to the MT binding region of tau (Alzforum website; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.alzforum.org/res/com/mut/tau/table1.asp">http://www.alzforum.org/res/com/mut/tau/table1.asp</ext-link>), G55R maps to the relatively poorly understood amino terminal region of the protein. Indeed, G55R is the first tau mutation mapping to either of the two alternatively spliced amino end tau exons (exons 2 and 3). More specifically, only two of the approximately two dozen previously characterized tau mutations are located in the amino half of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Hayashi1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Poorkaj1">[57]</xref>. Both of these map to amino acid position 5 (R5L and R5H). Both also exhibit a relatively late age of onset (75 and 62 years, respectively). In contrast, the proband and her two siblings (who we speculate carried the G55R mutation) presented with a relatively young age of onset (ca. 50 years). However the age of onset in the proband's father (who we also speculate carried the G55R mutation) was ca. 70 years. This may suggest the existence of additional factors modulating G55R phenotypic impact. One could speculate that the uncommon H1x haplotype associated with the G55R mutation could confer additional variability upon G55R action.</p>

        <title>Molecular Mechanisms of Pathogenesis</title>
        <p>The molecular mechanisms underlying pathological tau action remain poorly understood and are a very active area of investigation. One key feature of this effort is the recognition that cells go to enormous lengths to tightly regulate tau activity. For example, relatively subtle errors in tau RNA alternative splicing having no effect on the tau amino acid sequence can cause neuronal cell death and dementia in FTD, PSP, CBD and Pick's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Clark1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Hutton1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Spillantini1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Kertesz1">[76]</xref>. Subtle errors in the regulation of tau phosphorylation are also widely believed to play an important role in tau mediated neuronal cell death and dementia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Dolan1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Mi1">[77]</xref>. By analogy to the pharmacology of MT directed anti-cancer drugs, we have proposed previously that cells must maintain tau activity within a narrow range of acceptable levels in order to remain viable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Bunker1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Levy1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Feinstein1">[78]</xref>. By this mis-regulation of tau activity model, either too much tau activity or too little tau activity (or qualitatively altered tau activity) can lead to neuronal cell death and dementia.</p>
        <p>Our observation that 4R G55R tau nucleates MT assembly more effectively than does 4R WT tau is completely consistent with the notion that subtle mis-regulation of tau activity can be deleterious. Although it was originally believed that axonal MTs are nucleated at the centrosome in the cell body and then transported as small MTs down the axon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Yu1">[79]</xref>, more recent work indicates that adult axonal MTs are nucleated acentrosomally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Stiess1">[80]</xref>. Over-active tau mediated MT nucleation could easily have deleterious effects upon mature neurons. As just one example, aberrant MT nucleation activity could lead to misdirected MT organization, which could in turn interfere with the efficiency of axonal transport. Additionally, although it is unusual for a mutation to increase the effectiveness of a normal activity, the Q336R tau mutation also enhances the ability of tau to promote MT assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-PickeringBrown1">[81]</xref>. Further, isoform specific effects of tau mutations such as we observed for MT nucleation are unusual but not unprecedented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-LeBoeuf1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Hogg1">[75]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Another interesting and non-mutually exclusive possible mechanism of G55R pathogenesis involves release of potentially toxic tau fragments into the extracellular space, which has been observed in dementia patients as well as model systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Borroni1">[82]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Kim1">[83]</xref>. This process can be inhibited by the presence of exon 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Kim2">[84]</xref>. It is possible that the G55R mutation disrupts this inhibitory effect upon secretion of tau fragments, thereby contributing to their accumulation and the pathological process.</p>
        <p>It is also interesting that a mutation such as G55R, mapping far from the MT binding region of tau, could have an impact on the ability of the protein to regulate MT nucleation. However, it has long been known that the presence of the amino region of tau can have strong albeit indirect effects upon the ability of the protein to bind to MTs and regulate their dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Trinczek1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Butner1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Goode1">[30]</xref>. Additionally, antibody epitope mapping data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Jicha1">[85]</xref>, FRET data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Jeganathan1">[86]</xref> and more recent NMR studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0076409-Mukrasch1">[87]</xref> indicate that the amino region of tau can fold together with the MT binding region of the protein. It follows that a mutation in the amino region of the protein could have a marked impact on overall three dimensional structure and the ability of tau to engage in intra-molecular and inter-molecular interactions necessary for its action.</p>
