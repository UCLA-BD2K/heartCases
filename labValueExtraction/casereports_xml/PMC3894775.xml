      <abstract>
        <p>Dentigerous cyst (DC) is one of the most common odontogenic cysts of the jaws and
rarely recurs. On the other hand, keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT), formerly
known as odontogenic keratocyst (OKC), is considered a benign unicystic or
multicystic intraosseous neoplasm and one of the most aggressive odontogenic lesions
presenting relatively high recurrence rate and a tendency to invade adjacent tissue.
Two cases of these odontogenic lesions occurring in children are presented. They were
very similar in clinical and radiographic characteristics, and both were treated by
marsupialization. The treatment was chosen in order to preserve the associated
permanent teeth with complementary orthodontic treatment to direct eruption of the
associated permanent teeth. At 7-years of follow-up, none of the cases showed
recurrence.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The frequency of odontogenic cysts in children is relatively low. It has been estimated
that about 4%-9% of dentigerous cysts occur in the first decade of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup>. Keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT) presents most frequently in the
second, third and fourth decades of life (54.2%) with rare cases reported as early as
the first, and as late as the ninth decade of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref></sup>. Removal of the entire
cyst associated with the extraction of the impacted tooth is the main treatment to
prevent recurrence of odontogenic cystic lesions. However, when there is a possibility
of preservation and eruption of those teeth, conservative treatment should be the
choice. Treatment of KCOTs remains a controversial subject because of their great
potential to recur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref></sup>. Sometimes, the
first surgical approach in KCOT is decompression or marsupialization and when it gains
reduced volume, enucleation has to be performed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>This paper presents two cases of odontogenic lesions in children, one dentigerous cyst
and one keratocystic odontogenic tumor, which were treated by marsupialization in order
to preserve the associated permanent teeth.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <sec>
        <title>Case 1</title>
        <p>An 8-year-old boy was referred to the Department of Oral Surgery with chief complaint
of volume augmentation at the left side of mandible, pain and fever for about one
week. Panoramic radiograph revealed a unilocular radiolucent cystic lesion with
sclerotic border associated lateral incisor, canine, first and second premolar
crowns. Teeth were dislocated apically and medially. After local bone aspiration and
incisional biopsy, the histological diagnosis of dentigerous cyst was established
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). Analysis of capsule fragment
showed to be lined by non-keratinized epithelium. Hemorrhagic areas were also
present. Under local anesthesia, the patient was submitted to marsupialization after
extraction of the primary molars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2a</xref>).
The oral mucosa was sutured to the cyst capsule and iodoform gauze dressing was
inserted within lesion cavity. Medication gauze was changed every 5 days until the
wound edges were epithelialized and afterwards an acrylic plug was inserted in order
to keep wound opening and decompression. The parents were instructed to irrigate the
cavity twice a day with saline solution and the acrylic plug was fitted when
necessary, attending lumen reduction. Radiographic follow-up was performed
periodically. The involved permanent teeth erupted naturally, without any traction
forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2b</xref>). Second premolar assumed an
impacted position over the first premolar probably because of dental arch space
deficiency. Thus, under local anesthesia the second premolar was removed. One year
after the first visit, the lesion had completely withdrawn, but the lateral incisor
still remained displaced. A space-maintainer was installed and the patient was
referred to orthodontic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2c</xref>)
for correcting tooth position. The radiographic follow-up of 7 years showed no lesion
recurrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2d</xref>).</p>

        <title>Case 2</title>
        <p>A 10-year-old girl was referred to the Oral Surgery Clinic for treatment of a cyst in
the right side of the mandible found casually on a panoramic radiograph taken for
orthodontic treatment planning. The patient came without complaint but oral
examination revealed a slight swelling of alveolar mucosa related to a primary molar
and canine. The panoramic radiograph showed a segmented radiolucent area in the right
mandible body presenting a sclerotic border. Inclusion and dislocation of the
permanent canine, first and second premolars was also associated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3a</xref>). After local bone aspiration and
biopsy, a diagnosis of keratocystic odontogenic tumor was established. The cyst
capsule fragment presented a stratified epithelial lining with prominent columnar
basal cell layer and parakeratinized daughter microcysts were scattered in the
connective tissue wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Figure 4</xref>). In an
attempt to maintain the permanent teeth, the patient was submitted to decompression
procedure by extraction of the primary molars and insertion of iodoform gauze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3b</xref>). Changing of medication gauze and
acrylic plug were performed as described for Case 1. The permanent teeth went to
natural eruption and 2 years after the first visit lesion had healed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3c</xref>). Patient was submitted to orthodontic
treatment and radiographic follow-up of 7 years showed no lesion recurrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3d</xref>).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The histogenesis of dentigerous cyst remains unclear. Classically, they are defined as
cysts of development of the dental follicle. Authors related them to traumatic pathology
or inflammatory processes in primary teeth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, KCOT, formerly known as OKC and classified as a neoplasm by the World
Health Organization (WHO) in 2005<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref></sup>,
is a benign odontogenic tumor derived from the dental lamina that requires special
surgical consideration because of its known aggressive behavior and high tendency to
recur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup>. KCOTs have been
suggested as one of the major diagnostic criteria of nevoid basal cell carcinoma
syndrome (NBCCS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref></sup>. The rate of
recurrence varies enormously, from 0% to 62%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref></sup>, and the majority of
recurrences occur within the first 5 years after treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref></sup>. Most surgeons support complete removal with extension
margins or careful curettage of the surrounding tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Recurrence rates may be influenced by a variety of factors, including the length of the
follow-up period, treatment modality, lesion size, histopathological presence of
daughter cysts, and the number of cases investigated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Marsupialization or decompressions are rather advisable treatments primarily in
dentigerous cysts when we wish to preserve the cyst-associated teeth and promote their
eruption even though it is difficult to reliably predict the tooth eruption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref></sup>. Regarding treatment of an KCOT, removal
of the cyst including the associated tooth and surrounding bone has been generally
performed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref></sup>. Recently, it has been reported that marsupialization
can be an effective alternative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref></sup>. Some authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref></sup> described the use of decompression and secondary
enucleation as first line treatment option for KCOT. Furthermore when achieving a
significant reduction of the lumen which can be confirmed trough radiographic imaging, a
secondary cystectomy is justified to prevent recurrence of the lesion. The patients of
this report were in the first decade of life and still had unerupted permanent teeth
associated with the KCOTs. It was thus difficult to make a decision for an aggressive
surgery over conservative management.</p>
      <p>In both cases, clinical judgment led to the preservation of the permanent teeth
considering the age of the patients, the development of tooth roots and the possibility
of that conservative therapeutic could relieve pressure from cyst's fluid, allowing
reduction of the intraosseous lesion and apposition of new bone to the cystic
walls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Some clinical and molecular studies have shown that the parakeratinized and
orthokeratinized KCOTs were significantly different in molecular area as well as the
recurrence rate; orthokeratinized OKCs had a lower recurrence rate than the
parakeratinized OKCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref></sup>. Although the
OKC presented in this paper is of parakeratinized type and exhibited daughter cysts
observed within the lesion wall, which is a known factor of aggressiveness in KCOTs, the
lesion did not recur after 7 years of follow-up.</p>
      <p>Marsupialization has been considered as effective as a preliminary treatment for large
KCOTs and it seems not to affect the recurrence tendency of this type of cyst. It is
important to notice that the decompression procedure here was done without the
supplementary enucleation neither or application of Carnoy's solution.</p>
      <p>Reports also describe probable changes in growth characteristics when KCOTs are
submitted to decompression that turns it rather less aggressive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref></sup>.
Some authors have observed epithelial dedifferentiation and loss of cytokeratin-10
production after a mean treatment time of 9 months, but they also suggested that the
longitudinal follow-up of patients will determine whether this change is associated with
lower rates of recurrence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Sometimes after marsupialization/decompression eruption of the associated impacted teeth
assumes an unusual position and orthodontic traction of the impacted tooth has to be
performed if adequate space exists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref></sup>.
In both cases, teeth that were present came to eruption spontaneously and orthodontic
treatment was necessary to assure better alignment of teeth in dental arch. The left
mandibular lateral incisor on the dentigerous cyst case assumed a lingual position and
orthodontic treatment was important to correct the direction of eruption.</p>
      <p>Although complete resolution of the lesions was achieved by a conservative approach,
preserving anatomy and function, we agree with other authors that long-term follow-up is
mandatory and cannot be overlooked<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref></sup>
especially considering the odontogenic keratocystic tumor.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="conclusions">
      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <p>Both cases had similar radiographic aspects, both occurred in children, in the mandible
body and were associated to the same group of unerupted permanent teeth. It is important
to point out that only with an incisional biopsy and histological examination it is
possible to accomplish a definitive diagnosis. The treatment choice should regard
conservative managements with low morbidity particularly in young patients.</p>
