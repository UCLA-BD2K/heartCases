      <abstract>
        <p>Recent advances in DNA sequencing have enabled mapping of genes for monogenic traits in families with small pedigrees and even in unrelated cases. We report the identification of disease-causing mutations in a rare, severe, skeletal dysplasia, studying a family of two healthy unrelated parents and two affected children using whole-exome sequencing. The two affected daughters have clinical and radiographic features suggestive of anauxetic dysplasia (OMIM 607095), a rare form of dwarfism caused by mutations of <italic>RMRP</italic>. However, mutations of <italic>RMRP</italic> were excluded in this family by direct sequencing. Our studies identified two novel compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in <italic>POP1</italic>, which encodes a core component of the RNase mitochondrial RNA processing (RNase MRP) complex that directly interacts with the <italic>RMRP</italic> RNA domains that are affected in anauxetic dysplasia. We demonstrate that these mutations impair the integrity and activity of this complex and that they impair cell proliferation, providing likely molecular and cellular mechanisms by which <italic>POP1</italic> mutations cause this severe skeletal dysplasia.</p>

        <p>Skeletal dysplasias are a group of genetic disorders affecting skeletal development that cause deficiencies and deformities of the limbs and spine, dwarfism, or abnormal bone strength. Skeletal dysplasias are usually inherited as monogenic Mendelian traits or occur as a result of <italic>de novo</italic> mutations. We report identification of mutations in human POP1 gene as the cause of a severe novel skeletal dysplasia. Molecular analyses presented in our work provide an important link between the pathogenesis of the disease and basic cellular processes including RNA processing and the cell cycle. We posit that our work will also have an immediate impact on assessment and counselling of novel cases of severe short stature.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Skeletal dysplasias (SD) are a group of genetic disorders affecting skeletal development that cause deficiencies and deformities of the limbs and spine, dwarfism, or abnormal bone strength. SDs are usually inherited as dominant or recessive monogenic Mendelian traits or occur as a result of <italic>de novo</italic> mutations. Recent advanced in targeted whole-exome DNA re-sequencing have enabled several groups to identify of causative mutations underlying various Mendelian diseases, in which traditional linkage approaches were not feasible because of the paucity of familial cases in which to perform the mapping <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Ng1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pgen.1002027-Ng2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In this study we report the mapping of mutations causing a severe bone dysplasia in a family of unrelated unaffected parents with two affected siblings. The clinical and radiographic features of the affected siblings showed similarities to anauxetic dysplasia, an autosomal recessive spondylo-epi-metaphyseal dysplasia characterized by extremely short stature <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Menger1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Horn1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Both siblings had severe growth retardation of prenatal onset, a bone dysplasia affecting the epiphyses and metaphyses of the long bones particularly in the lower limbs, and abnormalities of the spine including irregularly shaped vertebral bodies and marked cervical spine instability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002027-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Anauxetic dysplasia is caused by mutations in <italic>RMRP</italic>, an untranslated intronless gene, mutations of which also cause cartilage-hair hypoplasia (CHH, OMIM 250250), another severe form of dwarfism <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Thiel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. As <italic>RMRP</italic> mutations had been excluded in this family, we sought to identify the disease-causing variants by whole-exome sequencing.</p>

      <title>Results/Discussion</title>
      <p>We sequenced exomes of both parents and the affected siblings using the Nimblegen SeqCap Ez exome capture protocol and the Illumina Genome Analyser II paired-end sequencing method. High quality sequence reads were aligned to the human reference genome (UCSC assembly hg19); 90% of targeted bases had coverage of fourfold or higher; and 79% of targeted bases had coverage greater than tenfold. We then used SAMtools <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) <xref rid="pgen.1002027-McKenna1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and custom scripts to detect polymorphic sites in the four individual exome sequence data sets. Following quality filtering, we retained approximately 15,000 SNPs per sequenced exome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002027-t001">Table 1</xref>). The vast majority of these SNPs (&gt;96%) were reported in the recent NCBI dbSNP 131 release, and were therefore excluded from further analysis as unlikely to cause this severe, rare, phenotype. Following the functional annotation of the remaining novel SNPs, we focused our analyses on a set of 483 unique novel coding non-synonymous SNPs that were detected in at least one sample.</p>

      <p>Given the affected status of both siblings and unaffected status of the parents we considered autosomal recessive homozygous and autosomal recessive compound heterozygous as the two most likely inheritance models; as the parents are unrelated, a compound heterozygous model was considered most likely. All novel non-synonymous SNPs were analyzed assuming either a homozygous or a compound heterozygous model. We did not find any novel non-synonymous mutations that satisfied a recessive homozygous inheritance model. To be accepted as candidate mutations for a compound heterozygous inheritance model, we sought genes with at least two novel non-synonymous SNPs within the protein coding sequence in both siblings; additionally, the same alleles had to be present in the parents in a mutually exclusive manner. We identified four candidate genes (<italic>POP1</italic>, <italic>PKD1</italic>, <italic>MICALL2</italic>, and <italic>COL5A1</italic>) that fitted this model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002027.s002">Table S1</xref>).</p>
      <p>To determine the gene likely to be causing the disease we analyzed the effects of the detected missense mutations on protein function using the SIFT algorithm <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In all but one gene the detected missense mutations were predicted to be tolerated in terms of effect upon protein function. The single remaining candidate gene carried two novel alleles &#x2013; one creating a premature stop codon, and the other causing a missense mutation with predicted damaging effect on protein function, thus representing a strong candidate for the disease-causing gene in this family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002027-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Remarkably, we found that this gene encodes the human homolog of the yeast POP1 (<underline>p</underline>rocessing <underline>o</underline>f <underline>p</underline>recursor RNA) protein, one of the core components of the RNase P and RNase MRP complexes <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Lygerou1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Esakova1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>

      <p>RNase P and RNase MRP are essential ribonucleoprotein complexes present in all eukaryotes <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Xiao1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Both enzymatic complexes have an evolutionarily conserved RNA component as a catalytic moiety. Several proteins essential for enzymatic activity form a constitutive part of RNAse P and RNase MRP complexes. POP1 is the largest constitutive component of both complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002027.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Esakova1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Xiao1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Importantly, mutations in <italic>RMRP</italic>, which encodes the RNA moiety of the RNase MRP complex, cause anauxetic dysplasia and cartilage-hair hypoplasia <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Thiel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To validate the identified <italic>POP1</italic> mutations we re-sequenced genomic DNA fragments encompassing mutated alleles of the <italic>POP1</italic> gene using Sanger sequencing, confirming that the two affected siblings carry both mutated alleles, while each parent carries only one allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002027-g002">Figure 2A, 2B</xref>). While neither of these mutations is located within known protein domains (as determined by PFAM annotation), both amino acids affected by the mutations show high levels of evolutionary conservation, suggesting their importance for the functional integrity of POP1 and/or RNase P/RNase MRP complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002027-g002">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002027.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The p.Arg513Ter mutation is likely to be particularly damaging; the premature stop codon located in the exon 10 would trigger mRNA degradation via nonsense mediated decay mechanism. Alternatively (though less likely), p.Arg513Ter mutation would result in translation of a truncated protein lacking the evolutionarily conserved POPLD domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002027-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). These results are consistent with findings in yeast. Xiao et al. <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Xiao1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> identified several point mutations in the yeast POP1 protein that affect either the stability or activity of RNase P and RNase MRP complexes. Importantly, some of the yeast mutations were found close to the mutations identified in our study, supporting our conclusion that these are likely to cause significant detrimental effect on RNase P and RNase RMP function.</p>
      <p>The very low population frequency of the described skeletal dysplasia, and the essential roles of RNase P/RNase MRP enzymatic complexes in cellular functions, suggest that there is strong negative selection pressure on homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations with detrimental effects on the activity of these complexes. Indeed, analysis of mutations that ablate POP1 function in model organisms demonstrate that POP1 is essential for viability in yeast and <italic>Drosophila</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1002027-Lygerou1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Peter1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In this context, it is likely that one or both detected <italic>POP1</italic> mutations have only a partial effect on function of either RNAse P or RNase MRP complexes. This conclusion is consistent with the broad spectrum of mutations observed in <italic>RMRP</italic> in cases of anauxetic dysplasia and cartilage-hair hypoplasia and their correlation with the severity of the disease phenotype <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Thiel2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. <italic>RMRP</italic> mutations implicated in anauxetic dysplasia and cartilage-hair hypoplasia have distinct clustering within the <italic>RMRP</italic> RNA molecule <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Thiel2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Importantly, POP1 directly interacts with the same <italic>RMRP</italic> RNA domains that are affected in anauxetic dysplasia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002027.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Thiel2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Welting1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. This further strengthens the link between our findings and the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical phenotype in anauxetic dysplasia and our patients.</p>
      <p>To assess population frequency of the <italic>POP1</italic> alleles we screened 186 DNA samples from healthy control subjects. For the NM_001145860.1:c.1573C&gt;T (p.Arg513Ter) allele we used direct Sanger sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA fragments. To estimate the frequency of the second <italic>POP1</italic> allele, NM_001145860.1:c.1748G&gt;A (p.Gly583Glu), we used a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay designed to detect the loss of the BsaJ1 restriction site (CCNNGG) created by c.1748G&gt;A (p.Gly583Glu) mutation. None of the 186 control samples contained either mutation. Further, these variants are not reported in public SNP databases including dbSNP 131. Therefore we conclude that both mutations represent novel rare alleles.</p>
      <p>One of the cellular functions of the RNase RMP complex is processing of precursor 5.8S ribosomal RNA into the mature form <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Esakova1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. To determine the impact of the mutated alleles on functional integrity and activity of the RNase P/MRP complexes, we measured relative abundance of the <italic>RMRP</italic> RNA and unprocessed pre-5.8S rRNA in the affected siblings, non-affected parents, and unrelated controls. We found that the relative abundance of <italic>RMRP</italic> RNA was markedly reduced in the affected individuals compared with non-affected parents and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002027-g003">Figure 3</xref>), indicating that the mutated alleles are likely to cause mis-assembly and destabilization of the RNase MRP complex. These results are consistent with the previous study in yeast demonstrating that mutations in <italic>POP1</italic> affect integrity of the RNase MRP complex, resulting in destabilization of the complex and reduction of the abundance of <italic>NME1</italic> RNA (the yeast homolog of human <italic>RMRP</italic>) <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Xiao1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. We also found that affected individuals have higher abundance of the unprocessed pre-5.8S rRNA compared to non-affected parents and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002027-g003">Figure 3</xref>), consistent with the established role of RNase P in processing of rRNA <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Esakova1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and demonstrating that activity of the RNAse MRP complex is impaired in the affected individuals. To assess the cellular impact of this molecular defect, we measured cell proliferation in stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002027-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These studies showed that, in comparison with healthy controls, the two affected cases had markedly diminished cell proliferation in response to proliferation stimulus, as evidenced by the reduced rate of dilution of CFSE fluorescence intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002027-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Additionally, individual SKDP-6.1, carrying the c.1573C&gt;T (p.Arg513Ter) allele, had noticeable reduction in cell proliferation rate, consistent with the predicted more damaging effect of this mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002027-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These findings also explain similarities with the anauxetic dysplasia phenotype, as individuals with this disease also have impaired RNase P/RNase MRP activity, and diminished cell turnover <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Thiel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Thiel2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, we have identified mutations in <italic>POP1</italic> underlying the skeletal dysplasia presented in this study. Involvement of <italic>POP1</italic> in the skeletal dysplasia highlighted the existence of a shared molecular pathway in the etiology of skeletal dysplasias involving the RNAse P and RNase MRP complexes <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Thiel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002027-Thiel2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and raises the possibility of the involvement of other components of the pathway, or allelic variants of <italic>RMRP</italic> or <italic>POP1</italic>, in other as yet unmapped severe short-stature syndromes. Screening of <italic>RMRP</italic>-negative cases of anauxetic dysplasia or CHH, or patients with similar phenotypic features, may yield additional mutated alleles within <italic>POP1</italic>, and possibly in other components of the RNase MRP complex. We further hypothesize that the distinct skeletal phenotype associated with <italic>POP1</italic> mutations may indicate that RNAse P and RNase MRP complexes may process other yet unidentified target RNAs with regulatory roles in specific developmental pathways such as osteogenesis. This study also provides an example of the feasibility of whole-exome re-sequencing approach in rare familiar monogenic diseases with small pedigrees.</p>

Relative quantification was performed as described in ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System User Bulletin #2 (Applied Biosystems) according to Comparative CT Method. In brief, threshold cycle (CT) values of experimental samples were normalized to corresponding CT values of the ACTB mRNA control, and then quantified relative to the sample with the maximal CT value (calibrator).
