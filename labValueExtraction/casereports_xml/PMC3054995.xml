        <p>Osteochondromas are common and typically arise from the metaphyseal ends of long bones. An osteochondral neoplasm of the soft tissue, which is a lesion of uncertain pathogenesis, is uncommon and usually arises from the synovial tissue in joints and tendon sheaths. Rarely, extraskeletal osteochondromas also arise outside of synovial compartments. Most of the reported cases were presented in the hands and feet, especially in the fingers. Here we describe a 44-yr-old female patient who presented with a pain in the left buttock. A well-defined osseous mass was detected in the buttock. It consisted of sharply demarcated, mature hyaline cartilage that was covered with a fibrous capsule, which changed gradually into cancellous bone, more pronouncedly at the center. The diagnosis of an extraskeletal osteochondroma should be considered when a discrete, ossified mass is localized in the soft tissues. A case of pathologically proven extraskeletal osteochondroma of the buttock is presented with a literature review, magnetic resonance imaging, and radiological findings.</p>
