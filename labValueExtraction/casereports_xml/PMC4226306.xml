          <p>The Arctic mutation (p.E693G/p.E22G)fs within the &#x3B2;-amyloid (A&#x3B2;) region of the &#x3B2;-amyloid precursor protein gene causes an autosomal dominant disease with clinical picture of typical Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease. Here we report the special character of Arctic AD neuropathology in four deceased patients.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>A&#x3B2; deposition in the brains was wide-spread (Thal phase 5) and profuse. Virtually all parenchymal deposits were composed of non-fibrillar, Congo red negative A&#x3B2; aggregates. Congo red only stained angiopathic vessels. Mass spectrometric analyses showed that A&#x3B2; deposits contained variably truncated and modified wild type and mutated A&#x3B2; species. In three of four Arctic AD brains, most cerebral cortical plaques appeared targetoid with centres containing C-terminally (beyond aa 40) and variably N-terminally truncated A&#x3B2; surrounded by coronas immunopositive for A&#x3B2;<sub>x-42</sub>. In the fourth patient plaque centres contained almost no A&#x3B2; making the plaques ring-shaped. The architectural pattern of plaques also varied between different anatomic regions. Tau pathology corresponded to Braak stage VI, and appeared mainly as delicate neuropil threads (NT) enriched within A&#x3B2; plaques. Dystrophic neurites were scarce, while neurofibrillary tangles were relatively common. Neuronal perikarya within the A&#x3B2; plaques appeared relatively intact.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>In Arctic AD brain differentially truncated abundant A&#x3B2; is deposited in plaques of variable numbers and shapes in different regions of the brain (including exceptional targetoid plaques in neocortex). The extracellular non-fibrillar A&#x3B2; does not seem to cause overt damage to adjacent neurons or to induce formation of neurofibrillary tangles, supporting the view that intracellular A&#x3B2; oligomers are more neurotoxic than extracellular A&#x3B2; deposits. However, the enrichment of NTs within plaques suggests some degree of intra-plaque axonal damage including accumulation of hp-tau, which may impair axoplasmic transport, and thereby contribute to synaptic loss. Finally, similarly as the cotton wool plaques in AD resulting from exon 9 deletion in the presenilin-1 gene, the Arctic plaques induced only modest glial and inflammatory tissue reaction.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Deposition of amyloid-&#x3B2; (A&#x3B2;) peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau (hp-tau) as neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), dystrophic neurites (DN) and neuropil threads (NT) are invariably found in the brains of patients with both sporadic and familial forms of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease (AD). The majority of the pathogenic mutations in the amyloid-&#x3B2; precursor protein (<italic>A&#x3B2;PP</italic>) gene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.alzforum.org/res/com/mut/app/default.asp">http://www.alzforum.org/res/com/mut/app/default.asp</ext-link>) results in either an increase in total A&#x3B2; or A&#x3B2;42/A&#x3B2;40-ratio and often in aggressive plaque pathology. The recently reported protective effect against AD of the p.A673T substitution in A&#x3B2;PP (p.A2T in A&#x3B2; peptide) further suggests that A&#x3B2; is pivotal for the disease development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p>
      <p>Distinct pathological features are seen in <italic>A&#x3B2;PP</italic> mutation carriers as well as in other early-onset familial forms of AD. For example, brains from carriers of mutations in exons 8 and 9 of the presenilin 1 gene (e.g. <italic>PS1</italic>&#x394;9<italic>)</italic> harbour cotton wool plaques; large ball-like plaques without an amyloid core [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>Similarly, there is a marked phenotypic variation also among patients with various <italic>A&#x3B2;PP</italic> mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], which is exemplified by different substitutions in <italic>A&#x3B2;PP</italic> codon 693. For example, both the Dutch <italic>A&#x3B2;PP</italic> mutation (p.E693Q; reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]) and the Italian mutation (p.E693K; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]) within the A&#x3B2; sequence cause amyloid angiopathy with intracerebral hemorrhages, whereas parenchymal AD pathology and dementia are subsidiary. Moreover, the Osaka <italic>A&#x3B2;PP</italic> deletion mutation (p.E693&#x394;) identified in a Japanese pedigree also causes a primarily dementing disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The <italic>Arctic A&#x3B2;PP</italic> mutation (p.E693G; in A&#x3B2;-peptide p.E22G) was initially reported as a polymorphism of unclear pathogenic significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Subsequently, the same mutation was found to segregate with AD in a Swedish family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Interestingly, the <italic>Arctic A&#x3B2;PP</italic> mutation increased the formation of large soluble A&#x3B2; oligomers/protofibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], while symptomatic carriers showed low CSF-A&#x3B2;42 levels but remained PIB-PET negative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The Osaka <italic>A&#x3B2;PP</italic> deletion mutation (p.E693&#x394;) also accelerated A&#x3B2; oligomerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] but it did not cause deposition of fibrillar A&#x3B2; <italic>in vivo</italic>, neither in transgenic mice nor in AD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p>
      <p>Elevated intra- or extracellular levels of A&#x3B2; oligomers/protofibrils are believed to be of pathogenic significance and neurotoxic effects have been demonstrated both on cultured cells and <italic>in vivo.</italic> For example, intrathecal administration of A&#x3B2; oligomers in rats caused impaired learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and extracellular accumulation of soluble dodecameric A&#x3B2; in the brains of <italic>A&#x3B2;PP</italic> transgenic mice impaired cognition independently of plaques or neuronal loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>We have previously reported epidemiological and clinical as well as a limited description (based on two Arctic AD brains) of some neuropathological features resulting from the p.E693G mutation in A&#x3B2;PP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Apart from concluding that the clinical features of this mutation are compatible with AD, we identified ring-formed A&#x3B2; plaques but did not further study the overall neuropathology. In another, more recent, biochemically oriented study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] we analysed the composition of Arctic A&#x3B2; plaques in the frontal and temporal cortex of two Arctic AD patients (patients Sw1 and Sw2 of this study) using biochemistry (including A&#x3B2; ELISA and MALDI-TOF and MALDI-imaging mass spectrometry) and complementary immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. A&#x3B2; ELISA and mass spectrometry analyses on brain cortex samples from one of our patients (patient Sw2 of this study) with the <italic>Arctic A&#x3B2;PP</italic> mutation revealed deposition of a heterogeneous mixture of A&#x3B2; peptides with a significant contribution of N-truncated and N-terminally modified A&#x3B2;. Moreover, by applying mid-domain, N- and C-terminal specific A&#x3B2; antibodies we demonstrated in the temporal cortex (patient Sw2 of this study), the presence of targetoid plaques composed of both N- and C-terminally truncated A&#x3B2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>Here, we have extended and made a comprehensive analyses of the neuropathology in <italic>Arctic A&#x3B2;PP</italic> mutation carriers, based on four autopsied brains. We have applied nine well-characterized antibodies to different epitopes spanning the A&#x3B2; molecule, including an antibody specific to the Arctic mutation p.E22G and two antibodies recognizing posttranslational modifications of glutamates 3 and 11 of A&#x3B2; (cyclization into pyroglutamate). Thus, we could define the pattern of differentially truncated and N-terminally modified A&#x3B2; deposition in different regions of the Arctic AD brains, and also correlate these to mass spectroscopic findings in cerebral cortex. In addition, we describe local effects of A&#x3B2; on neurons, the association of A&#x3B2; with other pathological features, such as accumulation of hp-tau, macro- and microglial reactions, and basic vascular alterations.</p>

        <title>Patients and brain specimens</title>
        <p>Two patients from a Swedish and two from an American family were included in the study. The presence of the Arctic mutation was verified by sequencing of exon 17 of the <italic>A&#x3B2;PP</italic> gene according to the methods previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Although not proven, these two families are believed to descend from the same Swedish ancestor, (for respective pedigrees, see Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>a-b). The Swedish patients died at 62 (Sw1 = IV:10) and 64 (Sw2 = IV:29) years of age, after six and eight years of disease duration, respectively. The American patients died at 72 (Am1 = III:1) and 59 (Am2 = IV:1) years of age after 16 and 8 years of disease duration, respectively.</p>

        <p>The basic histopathology was examined in sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), Bielschowsky&#x2019;s silver impregnation, thioflavin-S, Congo red or periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stains. The antibodies used for immunohistochemistry of A&#x3B2; hp-tau, astrocytes, microglia and neurons are listed in Table&#xA0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Well characterized antibodies to different epitopes in wild type (wt) A&#x3B2;, called <italic>general</italic> A&#x3B2;-antibodies (Table&#xA0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), were selected to identify epitopes in N-terminal, mid-domain and C-terminal regions of non-mutated A&#x3B2;.

In addition, <italic>specific</italic> antibodies recognizing A&#x3B2; with the Arctic mutation and certain post-translational truncations and modifications, were applied (Table&#xA0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p>

        <p>The deposition of A&#x3B2; in human brain has been suggested to follow a distinct hierarchical sequence, classified as phases 1 to 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

The pattern of A&#x3B2; deposits varied both with respect to the antibodies applied and to the different brain regions analysed.

          <p>In H&amp;E stained sections, senile plaques appeared as compact rounded structures with remarkably homogenous texture (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>d). The plaques were devoid of an amyloid core, as shown by the absence of Congo red (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>d, inset) and thioflavin S (not shown) positivity and thus resembled cotton wool plaques (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. With Bielschowsky silver impregnation (without gold enhancement) the plaques were moderately brownish with accentuation of peripheral parts and negative or weakly stained centres, giving the plaques a vaguely ring-like pattern (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>e).</p>

          <p>The area fraction of A&#x3B2; immunopositivity (A&#x3B2;<sub>x-42</sub>) in frontal, temporal and parietal cortices was about 25%. Plaques were present in all cortical layers, being most numerous and compact in layers 2 and 3, while in deeper layers they were somewhat larger and less distinct. In addition, in layer 1 there were often small diffuse plaques of variable numbers, shapes and staining intensities, as well as thin patchy variably immunopositive subpial bands (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>a-h). The variation in the cortical pattern appeared e.g. in occipital cortex, where layers 4 and 6 were virtually devoid of plaques and layer 5 displayed only a lesser number of diffuse plaques (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>d and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S7c). Variation between patients was also observed e.g. as a paucity of plaques in layer 4 in frontal cortex of patients Am1 and Am2 compared to more abundant plaques in the same region in patients Sw1 and Sw2 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Figure S1a-g, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Figure S2a, and Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>a).</p>

          <title>Staining with general A&#x3B2; antibodies</title>
          <p>With the C-terminal abA&#x3B2;<sub>x-42</sub> a majority of neocortical plaques in all four patients were ring-shaped (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>c), as described in the first study on patient Sw1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], i.e. the weakly stained centres of larger plaques were surrounded by distinct immunoreactive coronas.</p>
          <p><italic>In patient Sw1</italic> the ring pattern visualized with abA&#x3B2;<sub>x-42</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] was also clearly noticeable with abA&#x3B2;<sub>x-40</sub>, abA&#x3B2;<sub>8&#x2013;17</sub>, abA&#x3B2;<sub>5&#x2013;10</sub>, and abA&#x3B2;<sub>arc</sub>. The staining was progressively weaker and less distinct with the more N-terminal abs (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Figure S2a-g) and nearly negative with abA&#x3B2;<sub>1&#x2013;5</sub>, although with this antibody the small subpial plaques were still positive (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Figure S2f). No central accentuation with the N-terminal antibodies was observed (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Figure S2e-f).</p>
          <p><italic>In patients Sw2 and Am 1</italic>, on the contrary, the neocortical plaques displayed a targetoid pattern: In these two brains the plaques were ring-shaped only with the most C-terminal antibody abA&#x3B2;<sub>x-42</sub> (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>c)<sub>,</sub> whereas with abA&#x3B2;<sub>x-40</sub> the centre was clearly immunopositive (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>b). The mid-domain abA&#x3B2;<sub>17-24</sub> rendered the plaques most compact of all antibodies (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>e), whereas antibodies with epitopes towards the N-terminus stained the plaque coronas more weakly and centres more intensely (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>f-h, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Figure S1d-f). Confocal analysis of sections from patient Sw2 double immunostained with abA&#x3B2;<sub>x-42</sub> and abA&#x3B2;<sub>1-5</sub> clearly distinguished the two A&#x3B2; components in plaques: the peripheral corona was positive with abA&#x3B2;<sub>x-42</sub>, while the centre was strongly positive with abA&#x3B2;<sub>1-5</sub> (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>a). Therefore, the plaques could best be described as targetoid, not ring-shaped.</p>

          <p>In the CA1-CA4 sectors, the general A&#x3B2; antibodies disclosed abundant A&#x3B2; deposits of variable size and irregular shape. Remarkably, in hippocampus the plaques did not show such a distinct targetoid pattern as in cerebral cortex. Instead, they were small with a diffuse pattern when stained with different A&#x3B2; antibodies (insets of Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>a-f). In CA3 and CA4 sectors, in addition to the better defined plaques there were also background-like diffuse A&#x3B2; deposits, whereas in CA1 and CA2 such deposits were uncommon (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>a-f).</p>

Diffuse plaques were also abundant in stratum radiatum, subiculum (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>a-f) and transentorhinal cortex, whereas in entorhinal cortex they were relatively sparse. In the adjoining occipito-temporal cortex the plaques appeared similar as elsewhere in neocortex (cf.

          <p>Among the basal nuclei, claustrum was remarkably deviant: A&#x3B2; was deposited as large compact plaques, which had similar targetoid staining pattern as plaques in neocortex (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>: Figure S4a-g). On the contrary, in the neighbouring putamen the plaques were small and diffusely stained (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>: Figure S4h-k). These plaques were positive with the C-terminal abA&#x3B2;<sub>x-42</sub> (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>: Figure S4h) and abA&#x3B2;<sub>x-40,</sub> as well as with mid-domain abA&#x3B2;<sub>17-24</sub> (not shown) and were weakly positive with abA&#x3B2;<sub>arc</sub> (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>: Figure S4j) and abA&#x3B2;<sub>11pE</sub> (not shown). With the N-terminal abA&#x3B2;<sub>1-5</sub> plaques were almost negative (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>: Figure S4i), whereas with the pyroglutamate specific N-terminal abA&#x3B2;<sub>3pE</sub> the plaques were clearly discernible (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>: Figure S4k). In amygdala the A&#x3B2; deposition was similar to that in putamen, though with C-terminal antibodies the number of small diffuse plaques was greater (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>: Figure S4l).

          <p>In midbrain, the deposition of A&#x3B2; was scarce. Diffuse weakly stained A&#x3B2; deposits were discernible almost exclusively in nucleus ruber. Among the different A&#x3B2; antibodies, only abA&#x3B2;<sub>x-42</sub> and abA&#x3B2;<sub>17&#x2013;24</sub> stained these plaques. However, amyloid angiopathy could be clearly visualized with all A&#x3B2; antibodies (not shown). In pons, virtually no parenchymal deposits were observed despite brisk staining of blood vessels (not shown). In medulla, a few distinct plaques, strongly positive with all A&#x3B2; antibodies used were present in inferior olivary (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>: Figure S5a-i) and dorsal vagal nuclei (not shown). The pattern, number and size of plaques in medulla were approximately similar with both general and specific A&#x3B2; antibodies, although some variation in the intensity was observed (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>: Figure S5d-i). Remarkably, abA&#x3B2;<sub>x-42</sub> rendered the neuropil in inferior olivary nucleus distinctly positive (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>: Figure S5a and d), whereas with all other A&#x3B2; antibodies it was negative (e.g. Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>: Figure S5b-c and e-i). Olivary neurons within the plaques appeared fairly well preserved (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>: Figure S5d-k), but both abA&#x3B2;<sub>x-42</sub> and abA&#x3B2;<sub>17&#x2013;24</sub> stained cytoplasmic inclusions within inferior olivary neurons (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>: Figure S5d-e), as did also PAS and an antibody to lysosomal cathepsin D (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>: Figure S5j-k; see also paragraph <italic>Intracellular A&#x3B2; immunoreactivity</italic>).</p>

Furthermore, the pattern of the deposits was remarkably different from elsewhere in the Arctic AD patients&#x2019; brains, especially compared to the cerebral cortices. The immunopositive A&#x3B2; deposits were highly variable in size and had very irregular configurations, while distinct rounded A&#x3B2; plaques were completely absent.

          <p>Cytoplasmic immunoreactivity with abA&#x3B2;<sub>17&#x2013;24</sub> was observed also in some other locations, most prominently in cerebellum, both in Purkinje cells (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>a) and in neurons of the dentate nucleus (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>c).

          <p>In all Arctic AD patients&#x2019; brains neurons could be frequently identified within the cortical plaques. Interestingly, many of these neurons displayed relatively minor degenerative changes with characteristic vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli but had often somewhat condensed cytoplasm (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>a). These neurons were similar as those found within the large cotton wool plaques in <italic>PS1&#x394;9</italic> AD patients (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>b). Moreover, confocal microscopy analysis of cortical sections double-labelled for A&#x3B2; and neurofilament showed that some NF-positive axons traverse the plaques (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>c-d). Similarly, Purkinje cells surrounded by abundant A&#x3B2; did not appear degenerating, not even those with intracellular abA&#x3B2;<sub>17&#x2013;24</sub> positive deposits (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>a-b).</p>

          <title>Tau immunohistochemistry</title>
          <p>Hp-tau immunopositivity was abundant in cerebral cortices and it was mainly present as NTs. The frequency of NTs was accentuated within the A&#x3B2; plaques and thus plaques were delineated also by hp-tau staining (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>a-g, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S7a and c). Similar accentuation was also observed in <italic>PS1&#x394;9</italic> AD patients&#x2019; cotton wool plaques (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S9i and j). NTs were usually abundant in cortical layers 2 and 3, markedly lesser in layer 4, scarce to absent in layer 5, and slightly accentuated in layer 6. Thus, the frequency of NTs by and large corresponded to that of compact A&#x3B2; plaques (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>a-c; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S7a and c). In calcarine cortex, the abundance of NTs corresponded to Braak stage VI, according to the BrainNet Europe recommendation (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S7a). Within A&#x3B2; plaques NTs were usually delicate, but occasionally they appeared thicker approaching the appearance of DNs (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>b and g).</p>

          <p>Variable numbers of neurons with hp-tau positive NFTs were detected in all cerebral cortical areas examined (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>a, d-e). Neurofibrillary deposits were found in the cytoplasm of small or atrophic neurons (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>a, d-e), whereas larger (non-degenerated) neurons in cortical layers 3, 5 and 6, including those located within A&#x3B2; plaques, were usually devoid of NFTs (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>b-c). Most commonly neurons with NFTs were not distributed within though nearby plaques (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>d).</p>
          <p>Many hippocampal pyramidal neurons from CA4 to subiculum as well as in adjoining entorhinal, transentorhinal and occipito-temporal cortices harboured prominent NFTs (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>f). Furthermore, many of the granule cells in the dentate gyrus contained distinct hp-tau positive inclusions (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>g). In general, NTs were abundant in the hippocampal neuropil and DNs were more prominent within hippocampal than cortical A&#x3B2; plaques (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>g).</p>
          <p>In claustrum, the pattern of NTs, DNs and neurons with NFTs was &#x2212; like that of A&#x3B2; plaques &#x2212; similar as in neocortex (cf. Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>a-b and d). In thalamus, where the A&#x3B2; plaques were small and diffuse, only few NFTs and very delicate NTs were discernible. In putamen, where plaques were even less conspicuous, almost no NTs were present (not shown). In globus pallidus, where no A&#x3B2; deposits were detected, neither were hp-tau immunoreactive structures seen (not shown).</p>
          <p>Despite the abundance of A&#x3B2; deposits in cerebellar cortex and around Purkinje cells, no neurons (Purkinje cells, granule cells or other neurons) harboured NFTs. In addition, the number of NTs or DNs associated with A&#x3B2; deposits was insignificant (not shown).</p>

          <title>Macro- and microglial changes</title>
          <p>In all four brains, there was slight to moderate reactive astrogliosis in cerebral cortices. GFAP immunopositivity was accentuated within the A&#x3B2;-immmunoreactive plaques (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>a-b), mainly as a meshwork of thin processes. Although the number of astrocytic cell bodies in cerebral cortices appeared to be slightly increased, they were relatively diffusely distributed instead of being strictly oriented within or around plaques (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>a-b). Microglial reaction, as determined by Iba1 staining, in cerebral cortices was relatively modest and the distribution of microglial cells did not appear to follow the distribution of plaques (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>b-c). However, their frequency seemed to vaguely correspond to the overall density of the NT meshwork (not shown).</p>

        <title>Fulfilling the neuropathological criteria of AD</title>
        <p>We performed neuropathological examinations of the brains from four patients who carried the <italic>Arctic A&#x3B2;PP</italic> mutation and whose clinical picture complies with AD. We could demonstrate that the neuropathological hallmarks of AD, A&#x3B2; plaques and deposition of hp-tau, were prominent features in all four patients&#x2019; brains. However, the Arctic AD pathology has certain features that deviate from the common AD pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], as it is referred to in both of the latest consensus criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p>
        <p>When the ABC system of the new 2012 NIA-AA criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] is applied, the distribution of A&#x3B2; plaques, i.e. NIA-AA component A = 3, since the accumulation of A&#x3B2; is florid even in cerebellum (= Thal phase 5, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]). As for the neurofibrillary tau pathology (component B), the presence of NFTs throughout the neocortical regions fulfils the criteria of Braak stage V-VI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], i.e. NIA-AA component B = 3. Braak stage V-VI is also met, if the Brain Net Europe (BNE) staging is applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], as the neocortical NTs are abundant in the striate area (occipital cortex; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S7a). The grading of component C in the Arctic brains according to CERAD as recommended in NIA-AA criteria is somewhat problematic, because of the exceptional plaque structure. Although A&#x3B2; plaques are compact, they are devoid of fibrillar amyloid cores and only rarely harbour robust DNs. Nevertheless, we propose that they do fulfil the CERAD criteria for neuritic plaques, since they display delicate hp-tau positive NTs and occasional DNs. The frequency of plaques should be considered frequent, i.e. the component C = 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p>
        <p>Taken together, our neuropathological findings in the Arctic AD patients&#x2019; brains meet both the 2012 NIA-AA criteria for high level of AD- related changes (A3, B3, C3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and the previous NIA-RI criteria for a high likelihood of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The very rare &#x3B1;-synuclein positive neurons encountered (not shown) most likely did not contribute to the patients&#x2019; clinical picture. Neither did we find any significant ischemic pathology, although CAA was relatively prominent. Thus, the dementia caused by the <italic>Arctic A&#x3B2;PP</italic> mutation is due to AD, albeit with unique features of AD neuropathology.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the large, round cortical Arctic plaques bear resemblance to the cotton wool plaques, such as the A&#x3B2; deposits found in AD patients with <italic>PS1</italic> mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Similarly, the cotton wool plaques and the Arctic plaques are devoid of amyloid cores and harbour very few hp-tau-positive DNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, cotton wool plaques have a homogeneous composition (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S9), whereas the Arctic plaques are composed of variably truncated and spatially differentially distributed A&#x3B2; and therefore when immunostained with different A&#x3B2; antibodies they appear targetoid.</p>

        <title>Amount of A&#x3B2; deposition</title>
        <p>The extent of A&#x3B2; deposits in the Arctic AD patients&#x2019; brains was massive, which may explain why the weights of Sw1, Sw2 and Am2 brains were considerably higher than what is commonly recorded in sporadic AD. Alzheimer brains are usually atrophic, but no studies have systematically compared the brain weight with the A&#x3B2; burden. Interestingly, the brain weights in three of the five <italic>PS1&#x394;9</italic> AD patients with large cotton wool plaques of similar abundance as A&#x3B2; plaques in our Arctic AD patients&#x2019; brains were within normal limits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Hierarchical order of A&#x3B2; deposition</title>
        <p>In sporadic AD, A&#x3B2; deposition has been suggested to occur hierarchically in five phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The distribution of A&#x3B2; deposits in the Arctic AD patients&#x2019; brains corresponds to Thal&#x2019;s most advanced phase 5, for which the requirement is the presence of A&#x3B2; also in cerebellum. A&#x3B2; deposits were highly abundant in all Arctic AD patients&#x2019; cerebellum, but they were few in brain stem nuclei&#x2013;the criterion for phase 4. These features suggest that, in these brains, cerebellum may have become involved at an earlier phase or at a faster pace than the brain stem. Thus, the <italic>Arctic A&#x3B2;PP</italic> mutation may alter the hierarchy according to which the A&#x3B2; deposits are generally seen to emerge in AD patients&#x2019; brains. Perhaps abundant extracellular perivascular A&#x3B2; aggregates in Arctic AD brain overwhelm the perivascular drainage pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] in cerebellum leading to an early pathology. Moreover, the pattern of A&#x3B2; deposition and distribution in our Arctic patients&#x2019; cerebellum was exceptional (see next section).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Variation in the distribution of A&#x3B2; deposition</title>
        <p>The pattern and composition of A&#x3B2; deposits in the Arctic AD brain revealed additional topographic variability. The ring plaques, originally discovered by Bielschowsky silver and immunostaining with abA&#x3B2;<sub>x-42</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], were &#x2212; with the use of additional A&#x3B2; antibodies &#x2212; shown to be targetoid rather than ring-shaped (as preliminarily demonstrated in our previous article [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and now in greater detail in this article). These plaques were almost only observed in cerebral cortex, whereas in other anatomical locations the plaques were usually of more irregular and diffuse types.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, in claustrum the pattern of A&#x3B2; deposits was similar to that in cerebral cortex. This is consistent with a previous observation of cotton wool plaques in <italic>PS1&#x394;9</italic> AD patients&#x2019; brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, the tau pathology in claustrum was similar as in cerebral cortex. Claustrum is generally considered to be a part of the basal ganglia and the presence of plaques in this region would thus correspond to Thal&#x2019;s phase 3. However, this pattern was strikingly different from that in the other subcortical grey matter nuclei. For example, globus pallidus was virtually negative for A&#x3B2; plaques, while only small diffuse plaques could be found in putamen, thalamus and caudate nucleus. This discrepancy may be related to the fact that, of these regions, only claustrum has bidirectional connections with almost all cortical regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p>
        <p>The pattern of cerebellar A&#x3B2; deposits differed remarkably from the commonly observed restriction of deposits to the molecular layer in sporadic AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and from the abundance of cored plaques in <italic>PS1&#x394;9</italic> AD patients&#x2019; cerebellum. In the Arctic AD patients&#x2019; brains, the abundant A&#x3B2; deposition next to the Purkinje cells may indicate active A&#x3B2; production in these cells. Moreover, the apparent pattern of A&#x3B2; deposition along the perivascular drainage pathways (also depicted in NIA-AA article by Hyman et al. 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]) may be explained by a relatively profuse transport of extracellular A&#x3B2; through the molecular layer to the subarachnoid space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p>

        <title>Differential truncation of A&#x3B2;</title>
        <p>The composition of A&#x3B2; deposits in both sporadic and familial AD brains has been shown to be highly variable, with both N- and C-terminal truncations and modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p>
        <p>Our mass spectrometric analyses, in which we immunoprecipitated both wt and mutated A&#x3B2; from the temporal cortex of the patient Sw2 with antibodies against two distinct A&#x3B2; epitopes (ArcA&#x3B2;<sub>17&#x2013;24</sub> and wtA&#x3B2;<sub>17&#x2013;24</sub>), demonstrated that the deposits contained variably truncated and modified A&#x3B2; species, both wt and Arctic A&#x3B2;. Furthermore, our immunohistochemical stainings revealed that although all four patients carried the same <italic>A&#x3B2;PP</italic> mutation, both the distribution and the composition (truncations or modifications) of the A&#x3B2; deposits showed considerable inter- and intra-individual variability. This should not actually be surprising, since it is most likely that the &#x201C;machinery and milieu&#x201D; in the A&#x3B2;PP production, processing and/or A&#x3B2; aggregation are not identical in the four individual Arctic AD patients, nor in different anatomic regions within each patient&#x2019;s brain. Whether a similar variability in the composition of A&#x3B2; deposits exists in other forms of FAD has been the subject of several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p>
        <p>The variability in the composition of deposited A&#x3B2; also sets new requirements for the antibodies used in diagnostic work. Since truncations can occur at many different sites of the A&#x3B2; peptide, some antibodies give virtually negative parenchymal staining. Thus, either an antibody against the mid-portion of A&#x3B2; preferably against an epitope located C-terminally to aa 11 (to avoid problems with 11pE truncated A&#x3B2; species) and N-terminally to aa 40 (to avoid problems with the different C-terminal truncations), or a mixture of different antibodies should be recommended for routine analyses. In our hands, the antibody abA&#x3B2;<sub>17&#x2013;24</sub> (clone 4G8) appeared to best fulfil such requirements (even though it also recognizes <italic>A&#x3B2;PP</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]), whereas the other widely used mid-portion antibody abA&#x3B2;<sub>8&#x2013;17</sub> (clone 6F/3D) yielded inconsistent results. For instance, it gave only vague staining of the cerebellar parenchymal deposits, although it stained blood vessels in this region clearly positively.</p>
        <p>It is known that the Arctic mutation interferes with the processing of A&#x3B2;PP by making it less prone for &#x3B1;-secretase cleavage, while elevating &#x3B2;-secretase cleaved fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Natural processing of A&#x3B2;PP at the &#x3B2;&#x2032;-site (at A&#x3B2; aa 10/11) is also favoured over the &#x3B2;-site (at A&#x3B2; aa &#x2212;1/1) in situations when accession to it by BACE1 enzyme is affected, e.g. through structural twists in A&#x3B2;PP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Moreover, N-terminally truncated and modified A&#x3B2; peptides (e.g. A&#x3B2;pE3-x and A&#x3B2;pE11-x) have been shown to be significantly increased in the brains of AD patients with various PS1 mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Our data show that the Arctic mutation like the PS1 mutations referred to above may increase cleavages at aa 3 and 11 since we observed 3pE40arc, 11pE40arc and 11pE42arc in our MS measurements (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>e, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>: Table S1 and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]), and considerable immunopositivities with ab3pE and ab11pE antibodies. However, since we also observed a heterogeneous population of N-terminally truncated A&#x3B2; peptides, additional (primary/secondary) cleavages are also likely to occur in the Arctic AD brain. A&#x3B2;-peptides might also aggregate in a way that exposes cleavage sites and facilitates peptide truncation and their modifications as a secondary process.</p>
        <p>Lack of fibrillar A&#x3B2; and amyloid cores is a characteristic feature of both Arctic plaques and <italic>PS1&#x394;9</italic> cotton wool plaques. The reason for this feature in these two genetic variants of AD is unknown. Certain properties of the mutated forms of A&#x3B2; such as posttranslational modifications and altered propensity to oligomerize/aggregate, could offer an explanation for the limited formation of structurally ordered A&#x3B2; fibrils in Arctic AD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], whereas the underlying reason in the <italic>PS1&#x394;9</italic> AD patients is even less clear, because the cotton wool plaques in such brains contain wild-type A&#x3B2; only. It might be that in these two types of FAD A&#x3B2; aggregation is too rapid and does not lead to Congo-red positive, fibrillar A&#x3B2; deposits.</p>
        <p>It has been shown that the Arctic mutation leads to an accelerated oligomerization and disordered fibrillogenesis of A&#x3B2;, measured both <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The diameter of Arctic A&#x3B2; fibrils correlated with decreased neuronal viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Recent <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments on the aggregation process of ArcA&#x3B2;<sub>1&#x2013;40</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] demonstrated that at least four types of fibrils can be identified. The intermediate phase of spherical aggregates appeared at earlier time points and ArcA&#x3B2;<sub>1&#x2013;40</sub> fibrils polymerized more rapidly and at lower concentrations than wt A&#x3B2;<sub>1&#x2013;40</sub> fibrils. At late stages fragmentation and clustering of ArcA&#x3B2;<sub>1&#x2013;40</sub>, but not of wtA&#x3B2;<sub>1&#x2013;40,</sub> fibrils were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The results of these experiments are in agreement with the suggestion that spherical aggregates (containing abundant &#x3B2;-hairpin and/or &#x3B2;-sheet structures), and/or A&#x3B2; oligomers have a pathogenic role in the AD brain. Especially the larger soluble oligomers, i.e. protofibrils, are known to have neurotoxic properties. However, an alternative A&#x3B2; aggregation pathway, different from simple assembly of spherical aggregates and protofilaments into fibrils, has also been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], which may contribute to the distinct morphology of A&#x3B2; plaques in Arctic AD patients (i.e. Congo-red negativity of the Arctic AD deposits). Moreover, co-incubation of ArcA&#x3B2; with wtA&#x3B2;<sub>1-40</sub> led to kinetic stabilization of Arctic protofibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. An increase in the ratio of ArcA&#x3B2; to wtA&#x3B2; in Arctic AD may result in the rapid accumulation of neurotoxic protofibrils and acceleration of the disease process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p>

        <title>Cellular pathologies</title>
        <p>The large plaques in both the Arctic and <italic>PS1&#x394;9</italic> AD patients&#x2019; brains were found to embrace neurons. More specifically, in all four Arctic brains seemingly viable neocortical pyramidal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells could be identified within several plaques of variable A&#x3B2; composition. Interestingly, the perikarya of these neurons seemed intact and did not appear to be under way to develop neurofibrillary pathology. This sparing of neuronal perikarya is in accordance with the notion that intraneuronal A&#x3B2; triggers neuron loss in AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In several animal models it has been demonstrated that extracellular A&#x3B2; plaques do not seem to instigate neuronal death, whereas accumulation of intraneuronal A&#x3B2; correlated well with the loss of neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], including a transgenic model expressing pyroglutamate A&#x3B2;<sub>3pE-42</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p>
        <p>We showed that even apparently intact axons traversed the plaques. These observations are phenomena, similar to those in <italic>PS1&#x394;9</italic> AD patients, i.e. axons are not pushed aside to wind around the accumulated A&#x3B2;. However, the relatively low number of neurofilament positive intraplaque axons may indicate that axons traversing Arc plaques suffer from some degree of degeneration, as it was interpreted to occur within <italic>PS1&#x394;9</italic> AD patients&#x2019; cotton wool plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The intraplaque accentuation of NTs (i.e. axons containing hp-tau) in both Arc and <italic>PS1&#x394;9</italic> plaques supports the suspicion of axonal degeneration. Accumulation of pathogenic species of microtubule associated tau protein can impair axoplasmic transport and consequently contribute to synaptic loss, which may be pivotal in the pathogenesis of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. If the synaptic contacts are lost, sparing of the perikarya or axons <italic>en route</italic> cannot prevent functional loss (and further degeneration). The fate of axons within A&#x3B2; plaques obviously merits further analysis.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the non-fibrillar type of A&#x3B2; deposits in the Arctic brain induced only a limited reactive response. Although the density of astrocytic processes was increased within the Arctic A&#x3B2; deposits (clearly visible around Purkinje cells), the astrocytic cell bodies appeared not to cluster around the non-fibrillar A&#x3B2; deposits. Likewise, in <italic>PS1&#x394;9</italic> AD patients&#x2019; brains astrocytes did not cluster around the non-fibrillar cotton wool plaques, although in these brains the scarce cored plaques were surrounded by an increased number of astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Similarly, the Arctic non-fibrillar plaques did not appear to attract microglial cells. The presence of preserved neuronal perikarya and axons as well as the lack of activated glial cells strengthen the perception of extracellular non-fibrillar A&#x3B2; deposits as being relatively non-toxic. Thus, it is conceivable that A&#x3B2; oligomers, which are considered pathogenic, exert their effects already within the neurons or by being diffusely distributed (not in plaques) in the parenchyma.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>We have demonstrated special neuropathologic characteristics in the brains of four deceased AD patients with the <italic>Arctic A&#x3B2;PP</italic> mutation (p.E693G/p.E22G). The amount of A&#x3B2; deposited in the brains was profuse, but virtually all parenchymal deposits were composed of non-fibrillar, Congo negative A&#x3B2; aggregates A&#x3B2; Congo red only stained the walls of moderately to severely angiopathic vessels. Mass spectrometric analyses on temporal cortex samples showed that the A&#x3B2; deposits contained variably truncated and modified wt and mutated ArcA&#x3B2; species. The structure and composition of the A&#x3B2; deposits varied considerably between the patients. In three of the four analysed Arctic AD brains, the plaque centres containing C-terminally (beyond aa 40) and variably N-terminally truncated A&#x3B2; were surrounded by A&#x3B2;<sub>x-42</sub> immunopositive coronas giving the plaques a targetoid appearance. Furthermore, in each individual the architectural pattern of plaques was found to vary between different anatomic regions&#x2013;from diffuse deposits to targetoid or ring-shaped plaques. Tau pathology appeared mainly as delicate neuropil threads with accentuation within A&#x3B2; plaques. Thicker dystrophic neurites were only occasionally observed. Neurons within the large A&#x3B2; plaques appeared relatively intact. Thus, the extracellular deposits of non-fibrillar A&#x3B2; did not seem to directly damage neuronal perikarya or to induce formation of neurofibrillary tangles, supporting the present view of intracellular A&#x3B2; oligomers being neurotoxic. The enrichment of NTs within plaques may indicate axonal damage, even though neurofilament positive axons traversing plaques were detected. Finally, similarly as the cotton wool plaques in <italic>PS1</italic>&#x394;9 AD, the Arctic plaques induced only a modest glial and inflammatory tissue reaction.</p>

          <p>Immunostainings of semiconsecutive sections from a PS1&#x394;9 AD patient&#x2019;s frontal (ah) and temporal (i and j) cortex. The cotton wool plaques are similarly rounded structures as Arctic plaques, but the different antibodies stain them homogeneously, although with different intensities. The strong staining with abA&#x3B2;<sub>x-42</sub> (a) suggests that majority of A&#x3B2; terminates at aa 42, whereas A&#x3B2;<sub>x-40</sub> (b) species are scarce. N-termini appear to be markedly variable including considerable amounts of N-terminally truncated A&#x3B2; species starting with pyroglutamate (A&#x3B2;<sub>11pE</sub> or A&#x3B2;<sub>3pE</sub>; g and h). The homogeneous staining suggests that the variably truncated A&#x3B2; species are relatively evenly distributed within the plaques. i and j: Sections from temporal cortex show accumulation of hp-tau positive NTs within A&#x3B2; plaques (six plaques marked with numbers).
