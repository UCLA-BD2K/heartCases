      <abstract>
        <p>An unusually high incidence of microcephaly in newborns has recently been observed in
Brazil. There is a temporal association between the increase in cases of microcephaly
and the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic. Viral RNA has been detected in amniotic fluid
samples, placental tissues and newborn and fetal brain tissues. However, much remains
to be determined concerning the association between ZIKV infection and fetal
malformations. In this study, we provide evidence of the transplacental transmission
of ZIKV through the detection of viral proteins and viral RNA in placental tissue
samples from expectant mothers infected at different stages of gestation. We observed
chronic placentitis (TORCH type) with viral protein detection by immunohistochemistry
in Hofbauer cells and some histiocytes in the intervillous spaces. We also
demonstrated the neurotropism of the virus via the detection of viral proteins in
glial cells and in some endothelial cells and the observation of scattered foci of
microcalcifications in the brain tissues. Lesions were mainly located in the white
matter. ZIKV RNA was also detected in these tissues by real-time-polymerase chain
reaction. We believe that these findings will contribute to the body of knowledge of
the mechanisms of ZIKV transmission, interactions between the virus and host cells
and viral tropism.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging flavivirus that belongs to the same family as the dengue
(DENV), West Nile and yellow fever (YF) viruses (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Pierson
&amp; Diamond 2013</xref>). From the time it was discovered in 1947, ZIKV has been
associated with sporadic human infections in Africa and Asia (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Dick et al. 1952</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Hayes 2009)</xref>.
However, since 2007, the virus has been associated with large human outbreaks and a change
in the pattern of the infections has been observed. High rates of infection and severe
presentations, including neurological complications (<italic>Guillain Barr&#xE9;</italic>
syndrome, meningoencephalitis), have been reported (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Ioos et
al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Oehler et al. 2014)</xref>.</p>
    <p>In early 2015, several patients presenting with dengue-like symptoms, such as mild fever,
rash, conjunctivitis, and arthralgia, caught the attention of infectious disease physicians
in the Northeast Region of Brazil. Although all patients lived in a dengue endemic area,
dengue diagnosis was negative. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
results from patients&#x2019; sera revealed autochthonous ZIKV infection in the country for the
first time (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Zanluca et al. 2015</xref>). Currently, more
than 1,500,000 cases are estimated to exist in Brazil and ZIKV has spread to other South
and Central American countries (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">PAHO 2016</xref>).</p>
    <p>From October 2015 onward, an unusually high incidence of microcephaly in newborns was
observed. Most of the women who delivered these children presented ZIKV-compatible symptoms
during the first months of pregnancy. By February 2016, more than 5,600 suspected cases of
microcephaly in newborns had been reported, representing a more than twenty-fold increase
compared to the historical average of the last five years, and 120 suspected deaths due to
microcephaly related to ZIKV have been reported to the Brazilian health authorities (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">EBC 2016</xref>). Other frequent causes of birth
malformations, such as common viral infections and other infections, drug and alcohol
abuse, preexisting disease, and genetic history, have been excluded. Moreover, ZIKV RNA was
detected in amniotic fluid samples of two pregnant women who had ZIKV disease symptoms and
whose fetuses were diagnosed with microcephaly (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Calvet et
al. 2016</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Melo et al. 2016</xref>). Furthermore,
viral RNA and protein were detected in newborn/fetal brain and placental tissues, which
highlights the link between ZIKV infection in mothers and microcephaly in newborns (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Martines et al. 2016</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Mlakar et al. 2016</xref>). In this study, we describe ZIKV infection by
anatomopathological, immunohistochemistry (IHC), real-time RT-PCR analysis and serological
assays in placental tissues from women infected at different gestational time points
(including first and third trimester of pregnancy) and in necropsy brain tissues from
fetuses and newborns that died just after birth due to severe neurological disorders. These
findings might contribute to the body of knowledge about the transplacental transmission
and the neurotropism of ZIKV.</p>

      <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
      <p>
<italic>IHC</italic> - Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FF-PE) tissue samples were
stained using a conventional hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) technique (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Baurakiades et al. 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>Sections from the blocks were analysed by IHC as described by <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chong et al. (2009)</xref> with some modifications. Antigen retrieval was
performed using the BioSB<sup>&#xAE;TM</sup> immunoretriever (Santa B&#xE1;rbara, USA). The
flavivirus-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) 4G2 (hybridoma D1-4G2-4-15, ATCC HB-112)
was used as a primary antibody, followed by the secondary antibody (Reveal Polyvalent
HRP-DAB Detection System, Spring Bioscience) with a 30 min incubation at room
temperature. The specificity of IHC staining was confirmed by omitting the primary MAb
or using the non-related anti-Chikungunya virus MAb [named 1G1, produced at Carlos
Chagas Institute (ICC-Fiocruz, Paran&#xE1;, Brazil)]. The immunostained slides were observed
using an optical microscope (Olympus&#x2122; BX50, Tokyo, Japan). For each sample,
photomicrographs were taken in a high power field = 400x) using a Zeiss Axio
Scan.Z1<sup>TM</sup> scanner.</p>
      <p>
<italic>RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR</italic> - To confirm the identity of the
flavivirus in the IHC assays, the corresponding FF-PE tissue block was punched with a
hollow needle, and tissue cores 3 mm in width were removed for molecular studies. Total
RNA was extracted from these cores using the ReliaPrep<sup>TM</sup> FF-PE total RNA
Miniprep System (Promega) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s recommendations. When RNA was
extracted directly from the <italic>in natura</italic> tissue (case 5), the RNeasy mini
kit (Qiagen) was used following the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. RNA was eluted in 50 &#xB5;L
of elution buffer, and 5 &#xB5;L of the extracted RNA was amplified by real-time RT-PCR using
two primer/probe sets specific for ZIKV (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Lanciotti et
al. 2008</xref>). Real-time assays were performed using the GoTaq Probe 1-Step
RT-qPCR System (Promega) or the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR System
(Invitrogen) with amplification in the LightCycler 4800 instrument (Roche).</p>
      <p>The amplification runs contained two negative and two positive controls. The negative
controls consisted of a blank reagent with water and a negative human serum sample. For
the positive controls, RNA extracted from a virus stock or from acute ZIKV human serum
samples were used. The same tissue samples were also tested for the presence of DENV,
another flavivirus endemic in the Northeast Region of Brazil. Real-time RT-PCR was
performed using a published method for the detection of DENV-1, 2, 3 (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Poersch et al. 2005</xref>) and/or an unpublished method
for the detection of the four DENV serotypes (primer sequences available upon request).
RNA extracted from the four DENV-serotype virus stocks were used as positive controls
and a blank reagent with water and a negative human serum sample as negative
controls.</p>
      <p>To confirm the identity of the ZIKV in case 1, the amplicon was cloned in a pGEM-T Easy
vector (Promega). Nucleotide sequencing was performed by the Macrogen Sequencing Service
(Seoul, South Korea) with upstream and downstream primers of the cloning site.</p>
      <p>
<italic>IgM antibody capture ELISA</italic> - IgM antibodies were detected by an
<italic>in house</italic> IgM capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using
inactivated cell-culture derived ZIKV and MOCK (from non-infected cell culture) as
antigens, which were kindly provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The ELISA was performed as described by <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al.
(2000)</xref> with minor modifications. The positive samples were also tested with a
commercial dengue IgM capture ELISA (PanBio) following the manufacturer&#x2019;s
instructions.</p>
      <p>
<italic>Case reports</italic> - The Molecular Virology Laboratory of ICC is one of the
five official sentinel laboratories assigned by the Brazilian Ministry of Health to
perform ZIKV diagnosis. In this context, we describe five cases of miscarriage, newborns
with microcephaly or ZIKV infection during pregnancy.</p>
      <p>As the samples were received for diagnosis, the patients&#x2019; clinical records were
simplified. Even so, the laboratory analysis revealed relevant information about ZIKV
infection and contributed to the knowledge about potential mechanisms of transmission
and ZIKV neurotropism.</p>
      <p>This work was approved by the Institutional Review Board (number
42481115.7.0000.5248).</p>
      <p>
<italic>Case 1</italic> - A 31-year-old woman living in the Northeast Region of Brazil
confirmed her first pregnancy in May 2015. On May 8th, a first fetal ultrasound
examination was performed and the results indicated a fetal size compatible with six
weeks of development and normal heartbeats. On May 15th (seventh week of pregnancy), she
presented fever and rash limited to two days. These symptoms combined with the ZIKV
epidemic in the region led to a clinical-epidemiological diagnosis compatible with ZIKV
disease. On June 19th (twelfth week of pregnancy), a second ultrasound examination
failed to detect embryonic heartbeats and showed an embryo size compatible with eight
weeks of development (embryo CRL of 17 mm). Curettage was performed on June 20th, and
the placental tissue was fixed and embedded in paraffin for IHC and viral real-time
RT-PCR analysis. Four FF-PE placenta tissue samples were received by the Molecular
Virology Laboratory of ICC to diagnose ZIKV infection.</p>
      <p>The patient indicated that she had a DENV infection some years ago and received the 17DD
YF virus vaccine in 2013. Congenital infections with other agents, including Toxoplasma,
<italic>Treponema pallidum</italic>, Rubella virus, Cytomegalovirus and Herpes
simplex virus were negative according to appropriate serological assays. There were no
records of drug or alcohol abuse, co-morbidities or genetic background that could be
related to the abortion.</p>
      <p>
<italic>Case 2</italic> - A female with microcephaly and malformations of the feet and
hands was born at 38.4 weeks of gestation by vaginal birth and died within 6 h. It was
reported that the mother had a rash about a month before pregnancy and the doctor
suspected viral infection; however, no laboratory diagnosis was performed. The mother
was a 19-year-old woman that lived in the Northeast Region of Brazil. This was her
second pregnancy and the first baby was born without any malformations. There was no
kinship between the parents. There are no records of any contact with chemicals.</p>
      <p>
<italic>Case 3</italic> - A newborn male was born at nine months of gestation by
cesarean delivery and died within 20 h. It was reported that the mother had a viral
infection (not laboratory confirmed) in the third month of pregnancy. Also in the third
month of pregnancy, ultrasonography revealed fetal microcephaly and malformations of the
limbs and genitalia. The mother was a 26-year-old woman that lived in Northeastern
Brazil. This was her first pregnancy and she denied the use of medication during the
pregnancy.</p>
      <p>
<italic>Case 4</italic> - A newborn male was born at 35 weeks of gestation with a head
circumference of 29 cm and died the day after birth. The microcephaly was detected
postpartum. Serum and brain, liver, spleen, heart, adrenal gland and lung tissue samples
were received. The mother was a 21-year-old woman that lived in Southern Brazil.</p>
      <p>
<italic>Case 5</italic> - A 31-year-old woman living in the Southern Region of Brazil
had an exanthematic illness during the eighth month of pregnancy. Serum and urine
samples were collected five days after the onset of symptoms for laboratory diagnosis.
Five weeks later, the baby was born without microcephaly and without other apparent
complications. Placenta fragments, umbilical cord blood and newborn serum samples were
received for analysis. Tests for infection with other agents, including Toxoplasma,
<italic>Treponema pallidum</italic>, Cytomegalovirus, HIV, and Hepatitis B, were
negative.</p>

      <title>RESULTS</title>
      <p>
<italic>Case 1</italic> - The FF-PE placenta tissue samples (from the retained abortion)
included the decidua, amnion and placenta. Slides stained with H&amp;E showed chronic
placentitis (TORCH type) with chronic villous inflammation (histiocytic-predominant
villitis), edema and trophoblastic epithelium lesions when compared with normal villous
tissue. There was a hyperplasia in villous Hofbauer cells, villous stromal lymphocytic
cells and some histiocytes in the intervillous spaces. There were no significant
histological findings to confirm chronic chorioamnionitis and deciduitis in samples of
this study. There were no fetal samples available in all sections analysed.</p>
      <p>IHC analysis with the anti-flavivirus monoclonal antibody 4G2 showed immunopositivity in
Hofbauer cells and some histiocytes in intervillous spaces. There was no
immunopositivity in the trophoblastic epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.
1C</xref>-D). To confirm the identity of the virus, RNA was extracted from two cores
of the FF-PE tissue block corresponding to the areas of villitis. The specimens were
positive in the two real-time RT-PCR amplification assays, with a threshold cycle lower
than 34. In addition, RT-PCR tested negative for DENV.</p>

<italic>Case 2</italic> - H&amp;E slides from the brain, liver, lung, kidney, spleen and
placenta showed several pathological alterations. Histology of brain tissue revealed no
infiltration of leptomeningeal lymphocytes and no other pathological changes were
observed except for mild vascular congestion. Mildly affected gray and white matter
regions were observed to contain perivascular cuffs of mononuclear inflammatory cells,
especially lymphocytes and microglial nodules, often surrounding degenerating neuronal
cell bodies (neuronophagia). More severe affected gray and white matter regions revealed
extensive destruction and infiltration by mononuclear inflammatory cells, perivascular
cuffing by lymphocytes and clusters of microglia and macrophages marking sites of
neuronophagy. Diffuse microglial hyperplasia was also present in all brain tissue
samples. In addition, severe gliosis with reaction gemistocytic astrocytes and
microdeposits of calcium are also diffusely distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig. 2A</xref>). IHC with the 4G2 anti-flavivirus monoclonal antibody analysis
showed diffusely distributed immunopositivity in some glial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig. 3A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">B</xref>).</p>

      <p>Samples from the placenta exhibited a villous structure, chorionic amnion and decidua.
No umbilical cord samples were analysed. The villous structure of the placenta showed
distal villous hyperplasia (villous immaturity or delayed villous maturation).
Persistence of the cytotrophoblastic layer and thickening of the trophoblastic basement
membrane were present. There was some degree of villous hypervascularity and stromal
fibrosis. Several terminal villi seemed to be edematous, with reduced numbers of
syncytial knots and slightly higher than normal levels of lymphoplasmacytic cells. In
addition, Hofbauer cell hyperplasia with diffusely distributed focal villous sclerosis
with focal calcifications and moderate increases of intravillous and perivillous
fibrinoid deposits were observed. Vascular changes in villous stems were detected as
hyperplasia of the muscular layer associated with stromal fibrosis. Moreover, mild
chronic lymphocytic deciduitis of the decidua basalis was also observed. There was no
chorioamnionitis in these samples (Supplementary figure F).</p>
      <p>There was no reliable immunopositivity in the lung, liver, spleen and kidney. Real-time
RT-PCR analysis detected the presence of ZIKV in placental and brain tissues punched
from specific damaged tissue areas, with a negative result for DENV. ZIKV RNA was not
detected in liver tissue; RT-PCR was not performed in the other tissues, since they were
all negative in the IHC analysis.</p>
      <p>
<italic>Case 3</italic> - H&amp;E slides from the brain, liver, spleen, heart and kidney
showed remarkable anatomopathological injuries. Histology of the brain, liver and spleen
revealed similar pathological alterations as those of case 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig. 2B</xref>, Supplementary figure E).</p>
      <p>Heart tissue samples demonstrated mild vascular congestion. In H&amp;E stained kidney
samples, patchy distributed sclerosis of the glomeruli and moderate vascular congestion
were observed (Supplementary figure E).</p>
      <p>IHC analysis revealed diffusely distributed immunopositivity in glial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig. 3C</xref>-D). No reliable immunopositivity was observed
in the heart, liver, spleen and kidney tissue samples. Real-time RT-PCR assays yielded
positive results for ZIKV RNA in brain tissue samples and negative results for DENV
RNA.</p>
      <p>
<italic>Case 4</italic> - H&amp;E slides from the brain, liver, spleen, heart, adrenal
gland and lung displayed several anatomic abnormalities. Histology of the brain, spleen
and heart samples revealed similar pathological changes as those observed in cases 2 and
3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig. 2C</xref>-D). Adrenal gland samples showed no
pathological alterations but severe vascular congestion. In H&amp;E stained liver
sections, severe extramedullary hematopoiesis, slightly higher than normal levels of
lymphohistiocytic cells in periportal spaces and severe vascular congestion were
observed. Moderate hypoxic-type steatosis was also present (Supplementary figure C).
Lung tissue presented severe vascular congestion and edema, diffusely distributed
hyaline membranes (respiratory distress of prematurity) and vascular changes suggestive
of persistent fetal circulation (hyperplasia of muscular layer of alveolar artery)
(Supplementary figure B).</p>
      <p>The IHC analysis showed diffusely distributed immunopositivity in glial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig. 3E</xref>-G). No reliable immunopositivity in the
heart, liver, spleen, adrenal gland or lung was observed.</p>
      <p>
<italic>Case 5</italic> - In this case, all the specimens were tested by real-time
RT-PCR, and samples of sera and umbilical cord blood were also tested by ELISA. The
analysis of serum and urine samples from the mother, collected five days after the onset
of symptoms (during the third trimester of pregnancy), revealed the presence of ZIKV RNA
in the urine sample and anti-ZIKV IgM in the serum sample, confirming acute ZIKV
disease. DENV infection was excluded by both assays.</p>
      <p>In the analysis of the samples collected after delivery (placenta tissue, umbilical cord
blood and newborn serum samples), viral RNA was isolated from placenta tissue. RT-PCR
was negative for DENV. As the samples were received frozen, it was not possible to
performed IHC analysis. Umbilical cord blood and the newborn serum samples yielded
negative results for the presence of ZIKV RNA and anti-ZIKV IgM.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>In this study, we present new evidence of the harmfulness of ZIKV infection. Samples
from a miscarriage at eight weeks of gestation (embryo stage), which occurred one week
after the supposed ZIKV infection, exhibited chronic placentitis. Chronic inflammatory
lesions of the placenta are characterised by the infiltration of the organ by
lymphocytes, plasma cells, and/or macrophages and may result from infections (chronic
placentitis TORCH-type) or be of immune origin (maternal anti-fetal rejection) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Greenough 1994</xref>).</p>
      <p>TORCH-type chronic placentitis is common in Brazil and in many other countries, but it
is more often diagnosed in the last weeks of pregnancy (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Greenough 1994</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Baurakiades et al.
2011</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. 2015</xref>). In this study, we
report TORCH-type chronic placentitis associated with ZIKV in a placenta from a
twelve-week-old pregnancy.</p>
      <p>Vertical transmission of flaviviruses has been described in West Nile virus, resulting
in congenital chorioretinal scarring and central nervous system malformation (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Alpert et al. 2003</xref>). In addition, indirect evidence
has demonstrated congenital YF vaccine virus after immunisation in pregnancy without any
apparent involvement of the infant (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Tsai et al.
1993</xref>).</p>
      <p>Fetal infection is undoubtedly most often acquired during primary maternal infection by
the passage of virions through the trophoblasts (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Benirchke et al. 2006a</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first report of
TORCH-type chronic placentitis associated with ZIKV. Maternal cellular infiltration as
well as an increase of Hofbauer cells (placental macrophages) are common features of
TORCH-type chronic placentitis. The activation of macrophages in the villi has been
implicated in the destruction of the villous architecture and the trophoblastic
epithelium, and these findings are consistent with alterations in the placental
immunological barrier. In the cases reported herein, viral protein were detected in IHC
by MAb 4G2 in Hofbauer cells as well as maternal histiocytes. Hofbauer cells have the
migratory ability to reach the fetal vessels and then infect the fetal cells (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Baurakiades et al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. 2015</xref>). A reasonable hypothesis would be that ZIKV might
be using the Hofbauer cells and their migratory ability to reach the fetal vessels.</p>
      <p>Although none of the cases reported here presented significant histological aspects to
confirm chronic chorioamnionitis or deciduitis, three of them exhibited immature
placentas (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Benirchke et al. 2006b</xref>) and their
newborns had congenital anomalies. There are no reports in the literature to date of
placental immaturity with ZIKV infection and vertical transmission. The few reports
describing maternal <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> infections and congenital transmission
did not report on placental lesions (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Boussemart et al.
2001</xref>, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Alpert et al. 2003</xref>). There are
recent reports of placental calcifications, fibrosis, fibrin deposition and villitis
associated with maternal ZIKV infections, but none refer to immaturity (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Martines et al. 2016</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Mlakar et al. 2016</xref>).</p>
      <p>We also demonstrated severe fetal brain injury associated with the vertical transmission
of ZIKV. This adds ZIKV to the list of other flaviviruses known to cause encephalitis,
such as West Nile and Japanese and St. Louis encephalitis (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Love &amp; Wiley 2002</xref>). Brain lesions from cases 2, 3 and 4 had
anatomopathological characteristics similar to encephalitis caused by those
flaviviruses. However, ZIKV cases presented additional particularities, such as severe
brain damage with diffusely distributed lesions, while previous studies have
demonstrated chronic leptomeningitis and brain lesions located in the cortical and
subcortical white matter (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Hollidge et al. 2010</xref>,
<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Misra &amp; Kalita 2010</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al. 2010)</xref>. Previous studies demonstrated the teratogenic
effects of flaviviruses (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Laszczyk et al. 2007)</xref>
with neurotropism, including ZIKV, which has been associated with congenital brain
anomalies (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Martines et al. 2016</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Mlakar et al. 2016</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Sarno et al. 2016)</xref>. The flavivirus envelope protein was present in brain
tissues from newborns with microcephaly and ZIKV was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR of
the tissue samples. The presence of the viral envelope protein was not observed in other
organs, in accordance with previous findings on ZIKV infection during pregnancy (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Martines et al. 2016</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Mlakar et al. 2016</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Sarno et al.
2016)</xref>. This indicates that the brain was the main target organ for viral
replication in the fetus, highlighting a strong neurotropism.</p>
      <p>In addition, we described a case in which the ZIKV infection in the eighth month of
pregnancy resulted in the infection of placental tissue, but not the fetus. In this
case, ZIKV RNA was isolated from placental tissues, reinforcing the tropism of the virus
by this organ and showing that it is independent of the gestation period. The absence of
ZIKV RNA and anti-ZIKV IgM in the serum of the newborn strongly suggest that the fetus
was not infected, although ZIKV had reached the placental tissues.</p>
      <p>TORCH-type maternal infections, which are acquired earlier during pregnancy, may be
associated with severe congenital anomalies. When these TORCH infections are acquired in
more advanced stages of pregnancy (third trimester), infectious processes are often
observed in the fetus, but congenital anomalies are less commonly observed (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Baurakiades et al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Neu et al. 2015</xref>). A preliminary cohort study with pregnant women who
presented febrile illness associated with rash performed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
found that the pathological changes during embryogenesis occurs predominantly in fetuses
infected in the first trimester of development. On the other hand, central nervous
systems abnormalities were also observed in some cases when the infection occurs in the
third trimester of pregnancy (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brasil et al. 2016</xref>).
A plausible reason is that fetal morphogenesis occurs in the first nine-12 weeks of
gestation.</p>
      <p>In the cases described here, among the expectant mothers that reported clinical ZIKV
symptoms in the first trimester of pregnancy, one of them had villitis and exhibited
early miscarriage, and the other two, although they did not have active villitis in the
placenta, exhibited fetal brain abnormalities. On the other hand, in case 5, the
expectant mother was infected in the third trimester of pregnancy and the placenta was
positive for ZIKV, but the newborn did not have viremia or any congenital anomalies. In
light of these observations, even considering the small number of cases, we presume that
early fetal viremia, even in the embryonic period, could be more closely associated with
congenital anomalies. Furthermore, pregnant women infected in the later stages of
pregnancy may have sufficient placental maturity to avoid fetal contamination.</p>
      <p>Our findings of placental inflammation and the presence of ZIKV in Hofbauer cells
suggest that damage of the placental barrier may facilitate fetal infection, but this
needs further confirmation. Similarly, the temporal persistence of ZIKV in placental
tissues remains to be determined. A coordinated and extensive multidisciplinary research
effort on the biology, transmission and interaction of ZIKV with the human host should
be employed to address these issues.</p>
