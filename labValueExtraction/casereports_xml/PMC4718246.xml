      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Skin, the outermost body layer, is capable of displaying the earliest clinical manifestations of certain systemic diseases. According to statistics, cutaneous lesions are the first and sole diagnostic clues to around 1% of internal malignancies.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> First reported by Bazex et al in 1965,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Bazex syndrome, also known as acrokeratosis paraneoplastica, refers to a rare paraneoplastic syndrome, which is characterized by psoriasiform eruptions, nail dystrophy, and palmoplantar keratoderma. The cutaneous lesions usually involve the ears, nose, fingers, and to a lesser extent, the elbows and knees. The most frequent associated neoplasm is squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Isolated case reports demonstrated that the neoplasms of liver and the reproductive system could also lead to this paraneoplastic syndrome.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Here, we reported an uncommon case of Bazex syndrome about an 83-year-old man with pulmonary adenocarcinoma and correlated osseous metastasis.</p>

        <title>Case Report</title>
        <p>An 83-year-old man came to our outpatient clinic presented with slightly pruritic cutaneous lesions involving face, hands, and feet for 5 years. On physical examination, infiltrative erythematous plaques with scales were observed on the nose, cheeks, ears, and the dorsa of interphalangeal joints (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A, B); confluent erythema covered with yellow thick crust were seen on the knees (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C); all the fingernails were yellow-brown and thickened, with subungual keratotic debris (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D); both plantar pedis were discolored and hyperkeratotic (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E).</p>

        <p>The patient recalled a body-weight loss of 5&#x200A;kg during the previous 2 years. He had a 20-year smoking history with an average of 10 cigarettes per day. His family has no hereditary diseases.</p>
        <p>Laboratory analyses revealed that serum levels of creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, and lactate dehydrogenase were all within normal ranges. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (55&#x200A;mm/hour) and tumor marker CA125 (105.5&#x200A;U/mL) were significantly upregulated. The computed tomography (CT) scan detected a pulmonary adenocarcinoma and a number of local metastatic nodules on the right lower lobe, along with mediastinal swollen lymph nodes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). The positron emission tomography-CT further discovered diffuse bone metastases. The patient refused to undergo needle aspiration biopsy guided by CT.</p>

        <p>Direct microscopy and culture showed no signs of fungal infection in his fingernails or toenails. We performed a biopsy of cutaneous lesion over the left knee, which exhibited pronounced epidermal hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis, mild irregular acanthosis, mononuclear cell infiltration around blood vessels within the upper dermis, and roughly normal subcutaneous tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B).</p>
        <p>Based on his characteristic acral dermatitis and nail damage along with pulmonary adenocarcinoma, we diagnosed him as Bazex syndrome. He was given topical dexamethasone ointment twice a day and oral acitretin 10&#x200A;mg twice a day. Since the cutaneous lesions had no significant improvement after 10 days, we discontinued this combined therapy. Subsequently, the patient started to receive Gefitinib tablet 250&#x200A;mg once a day, which is a potent anticancer drug with reported efficacy in treating lung adenocarcinoma. After 4 months of medical treatment, the patient is still alive. Repetitive imaging examination demonstrated that the size of his pulmonary considerably reduced, but his bone metastases remained unchanged. Notably, his cutaneous lesions alleviated significantly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A, B).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Bazex syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic disease, which is most prevalent with squamous cell carcinomas of the upper digestive tract and cervical metastasis of an unknown origin.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Cases accompanying pulmonary adenocarcinoma as our patient reported here are very rare.</p>
      <p>The typical clinical feature of Bazex syndrome is psoriasiform eruptions that favors acral such as the fingers (61%), toes (39%), ears (79%), and nose (63%), with tenderness but no pruritus in most cases.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> This disorder typically progresses in 3 stages: cutaneous lesions on the ears, fingers, and nails; palmoplantar keratosis; the involvement of the knees, elbows, and torso. Remarkably, the underlying malignancy tends to display its symptoms during the stage of palmoplantar keratosis.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The histological findings of Bazex syndrome are unspecific, as in this patient. Particular features in the epidermis include hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, and irregular acanthosis to a lesser extent. Sometimes, interface changes like vacuolar degeneration can be detected. Dermal alternations include dilating vessels and perivascular inflammatory infiltration. Subcutaneous tissue was generally normal.</p>
      <p>The underlying mechanism of this paraneoplastic syndrome remains elusive. Abreu Velez and Howard<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> proposed a crossed reaction between specific types of tumor and cutaneous antigens. The growth factors released by highly proliferative cancer cells and neoplasm-associated zinc deficiency might also contribute to the occurrence of this cutaneous paraneoplastic disorder.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The cutaneous eruptions of Bazex syndrome are typically refractory to local therapy, including coal tar, salicylic acid, vitamin D analogues, corticosteroids, and ultraviolet radiation.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Conversely, the treatment of the underlying neoplasm often significantly improves the cutaneous symptoms. Notably, the reappearance of those lesions may indicate the recurrence of the tumor or tumor metastases.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In the most reported cases, the emergence of cutaneous lesions precede the symptoms of an underlying neoplasm by several months. Therefore, it is important to recognize these paraneoplastic skin features to achieve early diagnosis of malignancies.</p>

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <p>Our report here highlighted a potential correlation between pulmonary adenocarcinoma and Bazex syndrome, which is characterized by hallmark nail destruction and preferential involvement of body extremities. Recognition of these hallmark signs may allow a timely diagnosis of the underlying malignancy. Moreover, etiological therapy against underlying malignancy is essential for treating paraneoplastic Bazex syndrome.</p>
