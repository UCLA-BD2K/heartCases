      <abstract>
        <p>We describe a case of neurotrophic keratitis in association
with dihydroxypyrimidine dehydrogenase (DHPD) deficiency.
Ocular manifestations in patients with DHPD are rare and
neurotrophic keratitis has never been reported before. A six-year-
old boy who was a known case of DHPD deficiency and born
of a consanguineous marriage presented to our clinic with non-
healing corneal ulcers in both eyes. Reduced corneal sensations
were detected and the patient was started on lubricating eye
drops. The patient continues to be on lubricant eye drops and
there has been no recurrence of the disease.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Dihydroxypyrimidine dehydrogenase (DHPD) deficiency is
a rare metabolic disease. The patient usually presents in early
infancy with features of cerebral dysfunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Though other
ocular manifestations have been reported, to our knowledge
corneal involvement has not been documented in the past.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
This is the first case report of DHPD deficiency with corneal
involvement.</p>
    <sec sec-type="">
      <title>Case History</title>
      <p>An 18-day-old baby with failure to thrive was referred to
our clinic for eye examination. The patient was born of
a consanguineous marriage. His parents were first cousins.
At birth he was lethargic with poor cry and feeble suck. He
had bilateral hydrocele and large anterior fontanelle.
He was investigated for possible metabolic diseases. Blood
investigations included total and differential blood count,
blood sugar, serum electrolytes, serum ammonia, serum
lactate, serum pyruvate, liver enzymes, thyroid function tests
and arterial blood gases. Urine was tested for pH, ketones,
odor and reducing substances. Karyotyping with G-banding
studies was also performed. Though all above investigations
were within normal range urine gas chromatography showed
increased thiamine and uracil levels. Fibroblast cultures
indicated deletion of the DHPD gene and diagnosis of DHPD
deficiency was made. His elder brother was homozygous for the
mutation and excreted increased amount of thiamine and uracil
in urine; however, he was clinically asymptomatic. His eldest
sister has two normal alleles but his mother was heterozygous
for the condition.</p>
      <p>Ocular assessment at that time did not detect any
pathology. On subsequent follow-up his vision was found
to be reduced to 20/100 (Cardiff Acuity Cards). Ophthalmic
examination under general anesthesia was essentially
normal apart from astigmatism in both eyes. Glasses were
prescribed with orthoptic follow-up. At the age of six years
his visual acuities deteriorated to 20/200 and 20/120 (Sheridan
Gardner) in the right and left eye respectively. Bilateral central
corneal opacities were noticed along with peripheral corneal
vascularization. He subsequently developed recurrent corneal
epithelial defects [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>]. Schirmer&#x2032;s Test revealed normal
tear secretion. An initial diagnosis of exposure keratopathy
was made.</p>
      <p>However, on subsequent follow-up, he was found to have
markedly reduced corneal sensations and a revised diagnosis
of neurotrophic keratitis was made. For the last three years
his vision has remained unchanged and his eyes have been
managed satisfactorily with ocular lubricants with no further
recurrence of the corneal epithelial defects [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>].</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="">
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The DHPD enzyme is the rate-limiting step in the metabolism
of pyrimidine bases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> It catalyses the first step in the conversion
of thymine and uracil to beta-aminobutyric acid and beta-
alanine respectively [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>]. Partial or total deficiency leads to
increased accumulation of thymine and uracil in the serum as
well as cerebrospinal fluid. Excess bases are also excreted in
the urine. The cause for the neurological deficit is still unclear.
It has been postulated that the DHPD enzyme is required for
the synthesis of beta alanine, which is a neurotransmitter in
the brain. This may explain the reduced corneal sensation
and the development of neurotrophic keratitis in this child.
Various manifestations associated with DHPD deficiency
have been described, but most children present with
microcephaly, epilepsy and abnormal EEG profile, however,
many may be asymptomatic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> Ocular manifestations such as
microphthalmia, choroidal coloboma and nystagmus have
also been reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></p>
      <p>The condition has attracted interest in the recent years as
the DHPD enzyme is also the initial step for the metabolism of
widely used anti-neoplastic drug 5 Fluorouracil. Severe toxicity,
including death, following administration of 5 Fluorouracil was
reported in patients with DHPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></p>
