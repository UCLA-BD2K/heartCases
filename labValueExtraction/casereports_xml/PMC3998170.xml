      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>It is estimated that six thousand diagnostic cardiac catheterizations and two thousand
coronary angioplasties are performed per million inhabitants per year<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, all by retrograde approach. Roughly, for
every six thousand procedures, one patient has diffuse injury of the arterial system,
with involvement of the four extremities<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Despite the difficulty of arterial access, the anatomical diagnosis
of coronary artery disease today is no longer a barrier. It is currently possible to
conduct anatomical studies without the need for invasive study, especially due to the
improved image quality of coronary CT angiography. However, coronary intervention is
still a barrier, as larger profile catheters are used and anticoagulation is needed.</p>

      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>Patient aged 65, with a history of severe vascular disease, diagnosed in 2005 with an
abdominal aortic aneurysm and bilateral iliac occlusion. At the time, angiography of the
lower limbs was attempted to schedule a surgery, unsuccessfully, due to the lack of
arterial access, as the subclavian arteries were also occluded. In 2006, the patient
underwent surgical repair of the aneurysm and aortobifemoral bypass surgery.
Subsequently, the patient demonstrated stable development of the peripheral vascular
disease.</p>
      <p>In June 2011, the patient progressed with infarction without ST-segment elevation, with
TIMI Risk of 5, admitted to another hospital, where it was decided to carry out coronary
CT angiography because of a peripheral vascular disease, which revealed: moderate lesion
in the medial segment of the left anterior descending artery, critical lesion of the
first marginal branch, and critical lesion in the proximal segment of the right coronary
artery. Due to the lack of arterial access, it was chosen to perform clinical treatment
with beta-blockers, nitrates, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, aspirin
and clopidogrel. Patient developed recurrence of angina, with limiting pain on minor
exertion. The patient was referred to our service because of a refractory condition,
when it was decided to conduct percutaneous coronary artery bypass grafting by the
anterograde approach, by the transseptal approach of the right coronary artery and
circumflex artery.</p>
      <p>The access way was the right femoral vein, passing a 7F sheath, with the aid of a
multipurpose catheter in order to place it in the superior vena cava for transseptal
puncture. However, the patient had a patent foramen ovale, which allowed access to the
left atrium without need to puncture the septum. At that time, 8,000 UI of
unfractionated heparin was administered intravenously. Subsequently, a 0.035" 300 cm
hydrophilic guide was passed to give access to the left ventricle and ascending aorta,
placing an MP catheter in the descending aorta. After the hydrophilic guide was
retrieved and the 0.035" stiff 300 cm guide was passed, the catheter was exchanged. As
described in the previous case<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, catheter Amplatzer Left 1 (Launcher&#xAE;,
Medtronic Inc.) was initially used unsuccessfully in the left coronary artery
catheterization. Catheterization was possible with the catheter Amplatzer Right 2
(Launcher&#xAE;, Medtronic Inc.). Coronary angiography revealed: serious injury of 70% in the
left anterior descending artery in the proximal segment; diagonal artery with a 90%
lesion in the middle segment, but the artery is of a fine caliper; and serious injury in
the marginal branch estimated at 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure
1</xref>).</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="abc-101-01-0e11-g01"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Due to the severity of the anterior descending artery injury, the strategy shifted to
bypass grafting of the left anterior descending artery and first left marginal artery.
Guide 0.014" 180 cm (Fielder&#xAE;, Asahi Inc., Japan) was passed through the circumflex
artery and through the anterior descending artery. In the anterior descending artery,
direct placement of stent Driver&#xAE; 3.0 x 12 mm (Medtronic Inc, Ireland) was held. In the
circumflex artery, predilatation was required because of the severity of the injury,
with balloon catheter 2.0 x 15 mm (Sprinter, Meditronic), followed by placement of stent
Driver&#xAE; 2.75 x 14 mm (Medtronic Inc. Ireland). Control angiography with good
angiographic appearance, no residual lesion. In the procedure, 200 mL of ionic contrast
were used. The total procedure time was 90 minutes. Due to the volume of contrast and
radiation exposure time, we chose not to study the right coronary artery.</p>
      <p>The in-hospital period was uneventful, and there was no change in serum creatinine and
cardiac enzymes. At clinical follow-up, the patient reported improvement of angina
symptoms, currently in functional class I of the Canadian Cardiology Society, on control
myocardial scintigraphy without myocardial ischemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>), then opting for clinical treatment of the coronary artery.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Patients presenting acute coronary syndrome with high TIMI Risk (&gt;4) are associated
with higher risk and ischemic complications and death<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. In this group of patients, the invasive strategy is
associated with improved prognosis<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.
Furthermore, peripheral vascular insufficiency is also associated with a poor prognosis.
Even with a poor prognosis, this patient was maintained on medical therapy only because
of limited arterial access.</p>
      <p>For this group of patients, the access alternatives are especially translumbar puncture
and anterograde access through transseptal route. The translumbar route was described in
1929 by Santos and was well used in subsequent decades. From the 1960s, with the
development of the brachial and femoral technique associated with improved guides and
catheters, the technique was abandoned. As in our institution we have no experience with
this technique, we chose the anterograde technique.</p>
      <p>Catheterization of the left coronary artery was performed with catheter Amplatz Right
due to the smaller diameter of the aorta. Despite the high specificity of the coronary
CT angiography, it had no sensitivity for diagnosing severe injury to the left anterior
descending artery, changing the initial planning. So far, there are no reports of
anterograde coronary angioplasty. The great difficulty was the coronary catheterization
with higher profile catheter associated with the loop generated by the passage in the
atrial septum and LV passage to the aorta; catheter fracture is likely to happen. In
this case, to avoid kinking, the 0.035" guide was left until the coronary
catheterization. The passage of the 0.014" guide occurred with no major difficulties.
Despite the loop, the stent navigability was not harmed.</p>
      <p>We did not perform angiography of the right coronary because of the procedure time and
contrast volume. Farah et al. reported technical difficulty in the catheterization of
that coronary artery, managing only to contrast with the Judkins Left catheter and
injection into the coronary sinus, without selective catheterization of the coronary
artery. This report contrasts with the finding of Pearce et al. and can be explained by
the previous withdrawal of the right coronary artery, which allowed selective
catheterization.</p>
