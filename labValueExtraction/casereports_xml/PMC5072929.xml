      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Fontan procedure (FP) is a palliative surgical procedure used in children with single ventricle physiology. It involves diverting the venous blood from the right atrium to the pulmonary arteries without passing through the morphologic right ventricle.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Since first described in 1971, the Fontan procedure has become the standard operation for patients with single ventricle physiology.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Despite saving numerous lives for the past 45 years, the Fontan circulation is often associated with long-term complications such as heart failure, pleural effusion, hypercoagulability, portal hypertension, and atrial fibrillation.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Among these, long-term elevated systemic venous pressure and low cardiac output may lead to the development of liver cirrhosis, and such a progression may eventually result in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in some patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup></p>
      <p>In this study, we presented the case of a 16-year-old female patient who developed HCC at a young age after receiving the FP. Informed consent was written by the patient and her parents.</p>

      <title>Case report</title>
      <p>This female patient was born full-term at 2.6&#x200A;kg with an unremarkable perinatal history. At 3 months of age, she was evaluated for a heart murmur, and after receiving a diagnosis of tricuspid atresia with double outlet right ventricle, she was admitted to our hospital for treatment and further evaluation. At 5 months, she received a pulmonary artery banding operation, at 21 months she underwent bilateral bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt, and at 21 months, finally underwent a lateral tunnel FP. At 6 years of age, the patient began complaining of dizziness, and evaluation findings were consistent with sinus bradycardia. While receiving follow-up care for this condition, she was also diagnosed with a moderate degree of aortic regurgitation. The patient received a pacemaker insertion and an aortic valve replacement at the age of 10 years to treat sinus bradycardia and aortic regurgitation, respectively. At 9 years of age, the patient was evaluated for gait ataxia and developmental delay. Magnetic resonance imaging of her brain revealed a small lacunar infarction and cerebellar atrophy.</p>
      <p>At 15 years of age, the patient developed peripheral edema and an abdominal ultrasound was performed. The ultrasound revealed mild hepatic lobulations with no signs of ascites or liver cirrhosis. Laboratory evaluations showed normal liver enzyme levels, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were not measured.</p>
      <p>One year later, the patient was readmitted to our hospital because of abdominal distension, telangiectasia, and fatigue. The liver, on abdominal ultrasound imaging, showed a heterogeneous echotexture, warranting the need for further evaluation studies. A computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed a large mass involving most of the right hepatic lobe, as well as multiple masses in the left lobe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This image also revealed signs of progressive liver cirrhosis, such as ascites, hepatosplenomegaly, paraesophageal varicies, along with evidence of tumor thrombosis in the inferior vena cava and right and left hepatic veins. On laboratory evaluations, blood test results were as follows: aspartate transaminase (AST) 82&#x200A;IU/L(normal range; 1&#x2013;40), alanines transaminase (ALT) 28&#x200A;IU/L(normal range; 1&#x2013;40), gamma-glutamyl transaminase (GGT) 123&#x200A;IU/L(normal range; 8&#x2013;35), total bilirubin 1.8&#x200A;mg/dL(normal range; 0.2&#x2013;1.2), and AFP and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) levels were measured at 211,580&#x200A;ng/mL(normal range; 0.89&#x2013;8.78) and 35,721&#x200A;mAU/mL(normal range; 0&#x2013;40), respectively. The patient was seronegative for hepatitis B and C and reported no history of alcohol consumption. Her body mass index was 15.11&#x200A;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. She had a Child&#x2013;Pugh score of 8. Echocardiography revealed that ejection fraction of left ventricle was 59%. A chest CT performed on the same day showed multiple metastatic nodules in both lungs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p>

      <p>Three days later, the patient began experiencing hematemesis and hematochezia and an endoscopic variceal ligation was performed. Due to the presence of large volume ascites, peritoneal seeding could not be excluded and a percutaneous liver biopsy was not done. An incisional biopsy was obtained from segments 4 and 5 of the liver, and a diagnosis of HCC was pathologically confirmed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The patient received 1 cycle of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. She received 3 subsequent endoscopic variceal ligations. Currently, the patient is no longer taking warfarin for her underlying heart conditions, and as she is not a candidate for a liver transplantation, she receives supportive care for disease-related complications. After 2 months of chemotherapy, she died at home with hematemesis, possibly due to variceal bleeding.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the United States, &#x223C;650,000 to 1.3 million people are born with congenital heart diseases, and this number continues to show 5% increases every year.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Warnes et al<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> reported that with successful surgery, 85% of these cases survive to adulthood. Since first described in 1971, the FP has been used to treat various congenital heart diseases with single ventricle physiology.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Forty-five years after receiving this operation, some patients have experienced Fontan physiology-related complications. The postoperative circulatory changes result from the following 4 major changes: (1) single ventricle circulation, (2) nonpulsatile pulmonary perfusion, (3) systemic venous hypertension, and (4) intracardiac scarring.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup></p>
      <p>Chronic elevation of central venous pressure and tissue hypoxia are associated with hepatic complications. After the FP (with the exception of the atrioventricular Fontan), blood flow into the superior vena cava bypasses the right ventricle by going directly into the pulmonary artery (PA) or into the right atrium that is connected to the PA. Due to this configuration, the central venous pressure is not reflective of the intracardiac preload, but is instead representative of the chronically elevated PA pressure. Such mechanisms cause repetitive mechanical stretch and compression via passive congestion on hepatocytes.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> In addition, high systemic venous pressure results in low cardiac output, which, in turn, causes low hepatic perfusion and chronic tissue hypoxia. Passive congestion and tissue hypoxia cause repetitive hepatocyte injury and inflammation, leading to the progression of liver cirrhosis, ultimately resulting in the development of HCC.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup></p>
      <p>Cardiac cirrhosis-related HCC was first reported by Ho et al<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> in 1990. There are 10 published PubMed case reports of HCC after the FP, and with the addition of our case, this number has increased to a total of 11 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> HCC incidence after the FP has not been frequently reported. The incidence of hepatic complications including HCC are correlated with the duration of elapsed time since the initial FP.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> According to Baek et al<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>, the odds of hepatic complications were 4.4 times higher in patients belonging to a group with a postoperative duration of 11 to 15 years compared to patients with a postoperative duration of 5 years or less. The odds were even higher (OR 9.0) for patients belonging to a group with a postoperative duration of 16 to 20 years. Patients belonging to a group with a median postoperative duration of 11.5 years showed signs of hepatomegaly (53%), splenomegaly (9%), abnormal transaminases (30%), elevated GGT (61%), elevated biliruibin (32%), and coagulopathy (58%).<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup></p>

      </table-wrap>
      <p>A study conducted by Kiesewetter et al<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> in 2007 focused on patients with a mean postoperative duration of 14.1 years (range: 6.9&#x2013;26.4 years); they reported that 58.3% of patients belonging to this group had developed liver cirrhosis. Although subsequent studies failed to report postoperative duration, the authors reported that 15% of patients with a mean age of 26&#x200A;&#xB1;&#x200A;9 years showed signs of liver cirrhosis.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> For patients with liver cirrhosis, the risk of HCC increases annually by 1.5 to 5.0%.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> However, screening guidelines for subsequent HCC after the FP have yet to be made. Both our case and the case reported by Yamada et al<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> described patients who developed HCC 14 years after receiving the FP. In addition, another case of a 13-year-old female patient who developed HCC after cardiac surgery has been reported; although this patient did not receive an FP, she did receive palliative surgery at 7 months of age for pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Although AFP levels were not checked 1 year prior to the diagnosis, abdominal ultrasound images revealed no signs of liver cirrhosis and liver enzyme levels were within normal limits. The patient unfortunately showed rapid disease progression, and developed HCC within only 1 year. Thus, we propose that patients who have received the FP 10 years ago or earlier should receive AFP and abdominal ultrasound screening tests at 6 month intervals as part of an HCC surveillance program.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Patients who have previously received the FP experience long-term Fontan physiology-related complications in adulthood. In this study, we reported a case of a 16-year-old female who developed HCC 14 years after receiving the FP. With continued medical advancements, we expect the number of Fontan physiology-related complications to increase, and the incidence of HCC in these patients will also increase accordingly. Early diagnosis of HCC results in better patient outcomes, as many treatment modalities remain viable. Therefore, we conclude that a HCC surveillance guideline should be developed for patients who have undergone the FP.</p>
