          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Orthodontics, just as any other science, has undergone advances in technology that
aim at improving treatment efficacy with a view to reducing treatment time,
providing patients with comfort, and achieving the expected, yet hardly attained
long-term stability. The current advances in orthodontic technology seem to
represent a period of transition between conventional brackets (with elastic
ligatures) and self-ligating brackets systems. Scientific evidence does not always
confirm the clear clinical advantages of the self-ligating system, particularly
with regard to reduced time required for alignment and leveling (a relatively
simple protocol), greater comfort for patients, and higher chances of performing
treatment without extractions - even though the number of extractions is more
closely related to patient's facial morphological pattern, regardless of the
technique of choice. Orthodontics has recently and brilliantly used bracket
individualization in compensatory treatment with a view to improving treatment
efficacy with lower biological costs and reduced treatment time.</p>

          <p>This paper aims at presenting a well-defined protocol employed to produce a better
treatment performance during this period of technological transition. It explores
the advantages of each system, particularly with regards to reduced treatment time
and increased compensatory tooth movement in adult patients. It particularly
addresses compensable Class III malocclusions, comparing the system of
self-ligating brackets, with which greater expansive and protrusive tooth movement
(maxillary arch) is expected, with conventional brackets Capelozza Prescription
III, with which maintaining the original form of the arch (mandibular arch) with
as little changes as possible is key to yield the desired results.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Patients with Class III facial pattern and severe Angle Class III malocclusion pose
difficulties for the clinical management of sagittal relationship between maxilla and
mandible. Should surgery not be an option, clinical management is mainly concerned about
guiding the mechanics, since its onset, in order to produce effects that meet the
compensatory characteristics of the pattern. In the mandibular arch: restricted buccal
tipping of incisors; maintenance of reduced mesial angulation of anterior lower teeth
(except for canines that are usually distally angulated and, now, will be uprighted);
and, in the transversal plane, respect to mandatory dentoalveolar compensatory mechanism
- a <italic>sine qua non</italic> condition for transverse adjustment between the
arches. As for the therapeutic management of the maxillary arch, it highly welcomes
transverse gains, increased mesial angulation of canines and controlled protrusion.</p>
      <p>Analysis of Class III dental arches reveals that compensatory changes must be
proportional to the degree of malocclusion. As these patients nearly always undergo a
functional routine, at least temporarily, the exception will be if these compensatory
changes do not occur.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The essence of compensatory treatment performed with these patients is to adapt the
concept of normality for the occlusal relationship which is strongly influenced by the
degree of sagittal discrepancy between the arches. In these cases, the therapeutic goals
are completely individualized and treatment protocol must respect the adapted concept of
normality for the occlusal relationship. At compensatory treatment completion, maxillary
incisors will be more protruded and buccally tipped in accordance with esthetic
limitations; the maxillary arch will be more expanded or with a decreased lingual
inclination of posterior teeth; and all upper teeth will be more mesially angulated. All
these goals are set for the maxillary arch with a view to increasing its circumference
and length. Conversely, opposite goals are set for the mandibular arch: mandibular
incisors as well as posterior teeth more lingually tipped, with decreased mesial
angulation for all other teeth.<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Orthodontics has continuously sought to improve the efficiency of treatment in the
attempt to reduce its duration and chair time. Although average treatment lasts between
1 and 2 years, there is an ongoing attempt to reduce it. To this end, several techniques
and appliances - including surgical procedures, vibratory stimulation, greater use of
individualized archwires and brackets, as well as less frequent indications for tooth
extraction - will still be recommended. This article explores three important aspects of
such continuous progression: bracket individualization, self-ligating systems and
mechanical customization used to achieve greater therapeutic efficacy.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>WHEN TO TREAT?</title>
      <p>Despite not being the primary objective of this article, it is worth noting that the
compensatory approach of skeletal Class III patients must safely begin, at least
theoretically, in patients whose mandibular growth has ceased. Patient must present
signs of skeletal maturity - for girls, 24 months after menarche; whereas for boys,
there must be signs of full pubescence, such as voice alterations and facial hair. Such
signs may be confirmed by carpal radiograph which reveals that the patient has achieved
Haag &amp;Taranger's<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> stage IJ - an
indication that compensatory orthodontic treatment may begin or that there is a need for
corrected treatment by means of orthognathic surgery. Unlike compensatory treatment of
skeletal Class II malocclusions, should orthodontic treatment be performed before the
patient achieves the stage of skeletal maturity, treatment stability is not guaranteed
even if satisfactory occlusal correction is achieved.<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>CHOOSING BRACKETS AND LIGATION SYSTEMS IN EACH ONE OF THE DENTAL ARCHES</title>
      <p>In order to facilitate one's understanding of the treatment protocol presented in this
article, it is important to divide the choice of brackets and ligation system in
accordance with each dental arch.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>Maxillary arch</title>
        <p>Over the last years, self-ligating brackets have been given great emphasis, partially
due to producing lower friction. The possibility of theoretically applying force of
appropriate magnitude increases the chances of periodontal tissues producing a more
physiological response, thus producing more effective dental movements and, as a
result, decreasing side effects and reducing treatment time.<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Increase in treatment efficacy is defined as the achievement of results which are as
good as or better than those obtained by conventional treatment, especially within a
shorter period of time. Additionally, increased productivity brings along major
benefits for both clinician and patient. In orthodontic treatment, these benefits
include a reduced number of visits, reduced chair time, more comfortable treatment,
clinical procedures that can be easily performed by the orthodontist, a decreased
need for extractions, less invasive treatment procedures and minimized feelings of
pain and anxiety for the patient. Additionally, other factors associated with
treatment conclusion could also be included, namely: less decalcification or root
resorption or even better occlusal outcomes. The major gains of self-ligating
systems, which lay the groundwork for approaches that opt for this type of treatment,
are as follows: safe and complete positioning of the arch into the slot of the
self-ligating bracket, which allows greater control of tooth movement; less
resistance to sliding between the bracket and the arch, which increases the expansive
capacity of the system; quicker arch removal and placement with a consequent
reduction in chair time.<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Transverse expansion produced by self-ligating systems is explained by low friction
between the bracket and the leveling arch. This fact was demonstrated by a study
conducted with 20 patients in which the authors used non-conventional low friction
elastometers. Their results revealed significant transverse expansion during
alignment and leveling without further protrusion.<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p>
        <p>On the other hand, another research assessed patients treated with passive, active
and conventional brackets and found no significant differences for the distance
between canines, premolars and molars. It is worth noting that no statistically
significant difference was observed in the three groups assessed. Furthermore, in the
group treated with passive self-ligating brackets, the distance between canines as
well as first and second premolars had slightly higher values in comparison to the
other groups.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
        <p>A significant advantage of a good self-ligating system is its ability to produce
higher friction in clinical situations that require movement of a tooth, or a group
of teeth, to be restricted along the leveling arch. To this end, a conventional
elastometer may be used.<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
        <p>The influence of therapeutic goals over the mechanical management of self-ligating
systems is strengthened by a convenient method that includes the use of stops. They
are little extensions of telescopic tubes or U-shape 2 to 3-mm open hooks normally
positioned in the midline with the primary objective of avoiding distal sliding of
wire, which would invariably injure the patient. In the context of the treatment
protocol presented in this paper, it is recommended that the stops be placed in the
mesial surface of maxillary first molars with a view to favoring incisors protrusion
and canine mesialization.<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12 </xref></sup>The
possibility of fully exploring this capacity of producing expansion and protrusion
within a shorter period of time and in a more effective and, perhaps, more biological
manner is what explains our choice of using a self-ligating system to treat the
maxillary arch.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Mandibular arch</title>
        <p>Individualized brackets were reintroduced and spread in Brazilian literature by
Capelozza Filho et al.<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13 </xref></sup>This type
of bracket created an irrevocable culture of customization in Orthodontics which aims
at fully respecting the morphology of patient's original malocclusion and, as a
result, setting individual therapeutic goals. Capelozza<sup>&#xAE;</sup> Prescription III
brackets require considerably limited angulation (which certainly is the most
important factor for customization), with zero degree for canines and incisors and
increased lingual incisor torque (-6&#xB0;). For this reason, they are an excellent
treatment option to maintain or increase (in a controlled manner) the compensatory
features naturally present at the mandibular arch in Class III. This set of brackets
aims at minimizing protrusion and eliminating retroclination, which is key to achieve
success of compensatory treatment conducted with this type of patient. Nevertheless,
customization is clearly not restricted to the choice of brackets. It includes
careful bonding, proper selection of more restricted diagrams for the mandibular
arch, properly fitted wires and Class III elastic mechanics, all of which decisively
participate in preserving what deserves to be kept and highlighting what should be
increased.<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Particularly
with regards to diagram, it seems important to consider that it is determined in an
objective manner, that is, respecting the essence of the arch which, in Class III
patients, tends to present an increase in the distance between canines and a decrease
in the posterior width of the mandibular arch.<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>
        <p>According to the literature, mandibular canines of Class III patients present an
average difference in angulation of approximately 5 degrees in a distal direction, in
comparison to Class I patients. For this reason, Class III patients tend to promote a
natural compensation of mandibular incisors. Conversely, their maxillary canines
present a smaller difference in mesial angulation of 2 degrees. In short, Class III
patients have less tipped mandibular canines (-1.75&#xBA;) in comparison to Class I
patients (3.5&#xBA;). These values are very close to those suggested for compensation
brackets (Prescription III<sup>&#xAE;</sup>): zero degree for mandibular
canines.<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
        <p>There is a tendency towards lingual inclination of mandibular incisors in cases of
naturally compensated Class III malocclusion, since incisors inclination tends to
promote a movement of opposite direction and which is compensatory to the
maladjustment that results from a maxillomandibular skeletal imbalance. In other
words, Pattern III, Class III patients have maxillary incisors more buccally tipped
and mandibular incisors with increased lingual inclination.<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
        <p>It is difficult to preserve the natural compensatory characteristics of the
mandibular arch with the use of self-ligating brackets because, if we compare the
degree of expansion achieved by self-ligating and conventional systems, it is clear
that there is a stronger tendency for the former to increase the width of the
arch.<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15 </xref></sup>Therefore, since this
effect does not agree with treatment primary objective - which consists of preserving
the transverse dimension of the mandibular arch - the treatment protocol reported
herein chose to use the system of conventional brackets.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT 1</title>
      <p>A 36-year and 9 month-old female, Caucasian patient sought orthodontic treatment with a
chief complaint of anterior crossbite and mandibular prognathism. Her clinical
examinations revealed a great difference between maximal intercuspation (MI) and centric
relation (CR) in the anteroposterior and vertical direction, with a major impact on face
and occlusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig 1</xref>). With a view to performing a
safe morphological analysis, an acrylic interocclusal device was manufactured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig 2</xref>) with the mandible in CR, given that this
position favored qualitative analysis and, as a result, improved prognosis for a
compensatory treatment. For this reason, two analyses were carried out in order to
obtain patient's facial morphological diagnosis: one in MI, and another in CR. Her
frontal facial analysis in MI revealed little asymmetry, chin deviated to the right,
severe anterior proclination, good zygomatic projection, compressive labial seal and
decreased lower third. Nevertheless, in CR, analysis revealed that vertical shortening
and facial asymmetry were minimized, and a more balanced face without signs of chin
deviation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figs 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">1B</xref>). Profile analysis confirmed the aforementioned characteristics, both in
MI and CR, as well as an increased chin-neck line in MI. Nasolabial angle was closed
partially due to the compensation of maxillary incisors, but, especially in MI, due to
forced labial seal and consequent decreased ALFH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figs
1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">1D</xref>). Smile analysis revealed good
incisors exposure with normal inclination and slight deviation of the occlusal plane,
which was later justified by unilateral crossbite on the right side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig 1E</xref>).</p>

      <p>From a skeletal standpoint, morphological evaluation of the cephalogram revealed a
negative maxillomandibular step with mild mandibular prognathism, especially due to an
anticlockwise mandibular rotation, given that the cephalogram was taken at maximal
intercuspation. Although mandibular incisors were lingually tipped and strongly
compensated, they were also well inserted into the symphysis. Conversely, maxillary
incisors were well positioned in the maxillary bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig
3B</xref>).</p>
      <p>After collecting all necessary occlusal, functional, cephalometric and face-morphology
examinations, and evincing a deviation from CR to MI, we came up with the following
diagnosis: adult patient, mild skeletal Class III, brachyfacial, borderline for Short
Face and with an acceptable facial pattern. Class III relationship on the right side and
1/4 on the left side, with anterior and posterior crossbite on the right side.
Well-positioned maxillary incisors and retroclined mandibular incisors in relation to
the bone. Patient's morphological analysis of the face in CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figs 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">1D</xref>) reinforced the
need for compensatory treatment that aimed at increasing volume in the maxillary arch
and restricting the mandibular arch. The absence of crowding in the mandibular arch
favored such treatment goal, although it hindered an increase in circumference in the
maxillary arch.</p>
      <p>Treatment plan included the use of Damon MX<sup>&#xAE;</sup> standard self-ligating brackets
(Ormco), with torque of +12&#xBA;applied to central incisors, +8&#xBA;to lateral incisors and 0&#xBA;to
canines, respecting the need for increasing volume in the maxillary arch within esthetic
limits - which could be exceeded with the use of high torque brackets (+17&#xB0;, +12&#xB0; and
+6&#xB0;, respectively) or by producing, by means of low torque brackets (+7&#xB0; and +3&#xB0;, for
central and lateral incisors), a weaker protrusion, insufficient to correct crossbite.
The mandibular arch received Capelozza<sup>&#xAE;</sup> Prescription III brackets (Abzil,
3M(tm)). At first, mandibular incisors were not included in order to avoid protrusion
(given that anterior lower crowding was quite discrete) which could have been produced
by initial and random leveling of lower teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Fig
4</xref>).</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Capelozza<sup>&#xAE;</sup> Prescription III brackets (Abzil, 3M(tm)) have a very positive
characteristic that favors the therapeutic goal recommended for this patient: maximum
preservation of the mandibular arch or, in small proportions, a modest increase in the
natural compensatory characteristics. Torque of -6&#xBA;would be applied to mandibular
incisors to this end. In other words, mandibular incisors would be severely lingually
tipped by the mechanics to which brackets would contribute. Although there was no
intention of further using rectangular wires in the mandibular arch, this procedure does
not break with the concept of maintaining the original form of the arch. Without a
doubt, the key factor to achieve treatment success in this compensatory game is the
absolute economy of angulations provided by brackets with no angulation bonded from
canine to canine, which results in little protrusion and requires less space during
leveling.</p>
      <p>In this approach, which the orthodontist assumes total control of treatment, bracket
bonding was individualized and maxillary incisors were more cervically bonded so as to
adjust the incisal curvature of final smile and, at the same time, allow low reading of
strong torque embedded in maxillary brackets. Before interpreting this as nonsense, one
should remember that, in this case, treatment approach intended to increase maxillary
protrusion in accordance with esthetic limitations. Additionally, there is speculation
that this treatment protocol stimulates greater bodily buccal movement. Should
mandibular incisors be bonded, they were more cervically positioned in relation to the
vestibular axis point with the height of previously leveled canines as reference. All
aforementioned alterations are favorable in compensatory cases of skeletal and dental
Class III, as they favor good overbite as well as functional anterior guidance.</p>
      <p>With a view to enhancing the position of mandibular orthopedic stability and
deconstructing maximal intercuspation, fixed stops made of composite resin were bonded
to the lingual surface and incisal third of mandibular incisors with balanced and
uniform occlusal contact with antagonist teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Fig
4E</xref>). This measure favors buccal movement of teeth involved in crossbite,
stimulates extrusion of posterior teeth within the posterior interocclusal space created
to produce gain in vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO), and, at the same time,
improves treatment mechanical efficacy by producing an effect of occlusal unlocking.</p>
      <p>Also, with a view to directing movement towards the areas of interest, which were
carefully investigated, stops were bonded to the mesial surface of first molars and the
arch was adjusted with a space of 2 mm between the wire and the bracket. In other words:
The wire was mesially fitted on first molars and passed 2 mm away from the maxillary
incisors, thereby stimulating protrusion of these teeth. Additionally, elastomers were
placed on premolars and canines so as to concentrate the expansion in the anterior
region, thereby meeting the primary treatment objective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig 5</xref>). After correcting anterior crossbite, mechanics was directed towards
teeth #14 and 15.</p>

      <p>With a view to maintaining the compensatory characteristics, which are also related to
the form of the arch, C6A7 diagram was chosen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f06">Fig
6</xref>) for favoring slight retroclination of mandibular incisors and protrusion of
maxillary incisors. Additionally, in the posterior region, it respected the mandatory
dentoalveolar compensatory mechanism of the mandibular arch.<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>

      <p>Two months after the onset of leveling in the maxillary arch, a mandibular appliance was
installed with immediate use of Class III 5/16-in rubber bands supported by hooks placed
on maxillary first molars and mandibular canines. This measure immediately prevented
mandibular protrusion and, at the same time, produced space gain necessary for future
leveling of mandibular incisors without stimulating buccal inclination.</p>
      <p>Without a doubt, this treatment phase was the most difficult in terms of mechanics,
given that any careless procedure could worsen anteroposterior relationship between the
maxilla and the mandible and, as a result, create greater demand for treatment of
potential side effects. From this initial phase on, maxillary leveling was conducted
with a sequence of archwires evolving to 0.019 x 0.015-in steel wire. As for the
mandibular arch, the sequence of archwires stopped at 0.018 steel wires because
rectangular wires were not necessary for additional angulation or inclination reading.
During the formatting phase of the mandibular arch, morphology was consistent with the
initial treatment goals. Moreover, even if individualized brackets were used, they were
not completely customized and, for this reason, their maximum expression may not suit
this type of patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f07">Fig 7</xref>). In the final
treatment phase, panoramic and lateral radiographs were taken with a view to assessing
tooth positioning and potential biological costs inherent to orthodontic treatment
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f08">Fig 8</xref>).</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT 2</title>
      <p>A 26-year and 2-month-old female, Caucasian patient sought orthodontic treatment with
chief complaint of lack of space for implant placement at tooth #22 site and small-sized
tooth #12. Her profile analysis revealed maxillary deficiency and unsatisfactory lip
contact with her lower lip ahead her upper lip and open nasolabial angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f24">Fig 24A</xref>). Her frontal facial analysis revealed a
balanced face with good acceptability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f12">Fig 12 B</xref>).
Her smile was characterized by lack of space, disproportional maxillary lateral teeth
and tooth #21 darkened by endodontic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f12">Fig

      <p>From a skeletal standpoint, the cephalogram revealed a negative maxillomandibular step
with mild maxillary deficiency and differences between palatal and mandibular planes.
Maxillary incisors were buccally tipped as expected. However, mandibular incisors
counteracted occlusal analysis as they were well positioned in the symphysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f13">Fig 13B</xref>).</p>
      <p>Diagnosis was as follows: adult patient, mild skeletal Class III, dolichofacial with
acceptable facial pattern, especially from frontal view. Class III relationship on the
right side, with anterior crossbite on tooth #12, decreased overbite and overjet,
agenesis of tooth #22 and increased buccal tipping of maxillary incisors.</p>
      <p>Patient's self-perception of facial normality in frontal view reinforced the need for
compensatory treatment while eliminating the need for absolute corrective treatment by
means of orthognathic surgery for maxillary advancement. In this context, treatment plan
was directed towards the protocol presented herein: the use of Damon MX<sup>&#xAE;</sup>
(Ormco) self-ligating brackets. Unlike case 1, high torque prescription was chosen for
the maxillary arch (CI +17 &#xBA;, IL +10&#xBA;, C +7&#xBA;) as it required greater protrusion and
expansion, both of which were justified by more expressive buccal torque applied to the
maxillary arch and Capelozza&#xAE; Prescription III brackets (Abzil, 3M<sup>TM</sup>) used in
the mandibular arch.</p>
      <p>In case 2, the greatest challenge was to increase overbite and overjet while opening
spaces for appropriate rehabilitation of maxillary lateral incisors without producing
the effect of reversing the incisal curvature at smiling - which is quite common in
cases requiring major compesantion of maxillary incisors. In order to control such
effect, Prescription III brackets were used in the mandibular arch with brackets more
cervically bonded on maxillary lateral and central incisors.</p>
      <p>Once again, with a view to directing movement towards the areas of interest, stops were
bonded to the mesial surface of first molars, thereby producing a space between the
0.14" heat-activated wire and the bracket in the anterior region of the maxillary arch.
Additionally, elastic ligatures were used from right and left premolars to right canine
as - transversely speaking - those teeth functioned as reference of normality. Treatment
onset on the maxillary arch was of paramount importance, and so was installing the
appliance on the mandibular arch 40 days after using 0.014 x 0.025-in heat-activated
wire in the maxillary arch - 4 months after treatment onset. In other words, it was
installed after the maxillary arch form was established, which used to be limited, and
was now more expanded and defined. In order to favor greater anterior overbite,
maxillary second molars were not included in leveling. This set of actions is
definitively in accordance with the therapeutic goals previously established for
patient's compensatory treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f14">Fig 14</xref>).</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT 3</title>
      <p>A 23-year-old male, Japanese-descendent patient sought orthodontic treatment with chief
complaint of unilateral crossbite on the right side and mandibular shift to the right.
His frontal analysis revealed vertically balanced face with discreet laterognathism. His
profile analysis revealed clearly balanced maxillomandibular relationship with passive
lip seal, slightly open nasolabial angle, well-defined mentolabial sulcus and normal
chin-neck line. At similing, the patient presented some alterations such as reversed
incisal curvature in relation to the lower lip curve, asymmetry in the positioning of
teeth #13 and 23, and increased lingual inclination of teeth #14 and 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f20">Figs 20A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f20">B</xref>,

bilateral Class III sagittal relationship more severe in the second premolar region than
in the canine region. This difference in magnitude may be explained by the level of
compensation present in mandibular canines and premolars that resigned their mesial
angulations. Transverse relationship was impaired by unilateral crossbite on the right
side and decreased overbite as well as overjet in the anterior region. Frontal intraoral
view revealed a 2-mm deviation of the lower midline to the right coinciding with
mandibular skeletal deviation.</p>

mild laterognathism to the right, dolichofacial and pleasant face. Bilateral Class III
relationship with unilateral crossbite on the right side and absence of overbite and
overjet. He was asked about the possibility of undergoing orthognathic surgery, since
the procedure would be the only one capable of correcting asymmetry - one of his chief
complaints. Nevertheless, given that mild mandibular shift did not worsen after a year,
the possibility of surgery was discarded and compensatory treatment was chosen to solve
patient's occlusal problems, thereby enduring his small skeletal defect. Although the
patient was skeletal Class I, the relationship between maxilla and mandible was Class
III and granted him occlusal characteristics of Class III. For this reason, he was
treated under the same protocol employed in cases 1 and 2.</p>

      <p>Treatment lasted for 24 months, with a total number of 17 visits. Treatment time was
greater than expected due to unilateral crossbite, the need for individualization bends
and the clinician's learning curve - since this was the first patient treated under the
protocol described herein.</p>

      <title>FINAL CONSIDERATIONS</title>
      <p>The gains in efficiency of alignment and leveling produced by self-ligating brackets
have not been scientifically proved. Some recent studies do not seem favorable to
confirm the greater productivity of this system, since most of them aim at comparing the
magnitude of movement during alignment and leveling without considering the individual
variations of the samples.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17 </xref></sup>From this point of view, self-ligating
brackets would be just a more practical method employed to fit and remove archwires.
Nevertheless, directing mechanics associated with bracket individualization towards
flexile therapeutic goals seems to enhance treatment outcomes. Carefully using stops and
elastic ligatures to manage friction in self-ligating bracket systems used in areas
where movement is less required is a good example of how to explore the maximum
productivity of this system, and justifies the methodology employed to treat the
patients reported herein.</p>
      <p>Using individualized Capelozza<sup>&#xAE;</sup> Prescription III brackets (Abzil, 3M(tm)) in
the mandibular arch to treat Class III is essential to yield more esthetically tolerated
results, given that maximum maintenance of the arch form creates possibilities of
moderate gains in the maxillary arch without hindering smile esthetics. This occurs
because the ideal morphology for sagittal correction of the arches is limited by smile
reading; thereby giving the orthodontist the opportunity to create a less protrusive and
less expansive maxillary arch than he would mechanically do.</p>
      <p>It seems imperative to treat these malocclusions by means of absolutely individualized
methods, seeking to preserve what should remain and strictly change what must be
corrected. Treatment that starts on a reasonable or poor occlusal morphology should
continuously evolve to improvements so as to prevent a greater demand for treatment.</p>
