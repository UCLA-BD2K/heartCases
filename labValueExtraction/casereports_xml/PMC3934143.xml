        <p> This study examined two female offspring of a somatic cell cloned Holstein cow
that had reproduction problems and milk production performance issues. The two
offspring heifers, which showed healthy appearances and normal reproductive
characteristics, calved on two separate occasions. The mean milk yields of the
heifers in the first lactation period were 9,037 kg and 7,228 kg. The relative
mean milk yields of these cows were 111.2% and 88.9%, respectively, when
compared with that of the control group. No particular clinical abnormalities
were revealed in milk yields and milk composition rate [e.g., fat, protein and
solids-not-fat (SNF)], and reproductive characteristics of the offspring of the
somatic cell cloned Holstein cow suggested that the cloned offspring had normal
milk production.</p>

    <p>Cloning involves transferring the cell&#x2019;s nucleus into an enucleated mature oocyte, fusing
the two components together using electric stimulation and transferring the resultant
reconstructed embryo into the uterus of recipient cows, where it develops until birth.
Cloned offspring were first produced in sheep in 1986 using nuclear transplantation of
embryo cells [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and this was subsequently
achieved in cattle [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A sheep successfully
calved a somatic cell cloned animal in Britain in 1996 [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and this was later achieved in a cow in Japan [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
    <p>Although the reproductive characteristics [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and milk
production performance [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] in somatic cell cloned
Holstein cows have been examined, there are no reports on the reproduction and milk
production characteristics of the offspring of a somatic cell cloned Holstein cow. It is
known that abnormal phenotypes of somatic cell cloned mice are not inherited by the
clone&#x2019;s descendants [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, the offspring of a somatic cell cloned bull did do
not inherit the same abnormalities as the cloned bull [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These findings suggest that all abnormalities in the somatic cell
cloned cow are eliminated in the following generations through reprogramming during
gametogenesis [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Because the offspring of a somatic cell cloned cow showed healthy
appearances and had normal productivity, their milk production performance was studied
to determine the possibility of industrial use.</p>
    <p>In this study, reproduction and milk production performance of two offspring (CO1 and
CO2) of Cody 2 were examined to verify the normality of the cloned offspring. The
reproductive characteristics, the primipara age of the month or calving intervals (days)
of the offspring and their somatic cell cloned Holstein cow were examined (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Milk yield and milk compositions [fat, protein and solids-not-fat (SNF)]
for each lactation period and calving intervals of the offspring (CO1, CO2)
and their somatic cell cloned cow (Cody 2)</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="jrd-59-595-t001"/></table-wrap>). Furthermore, each offspring cow conceived twice, and no particular
abnormal reproduction characteristics, such as in primipara age or calving interval,
were found in the offspring of Cody 2.</p>
    <p>The actual milk yields during the 305 days of each lactation period and the milk
composition rates [e.g., fat, protein and solids-not-fat (SNF)] for CO1 and CO2 are
listed in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The lactation curve and
transitions of monthly milk compositions in the first lactation period for Cody 2, CO1
and CO2 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p> Lactation curve and transitions of monthly milk compositions [fat, protein
and solids-not-fat (SNF)] for Cody 2, CO1 and CO2 during the first lactation
period.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jrd-59-595-g001"/></fig>. No difference was observed in the monthly milk yield between the offspring cows.
The mean milk yields of CO1 and CO2 were 9,037 kg and 7,228 kg, respectively, with the
mean milk yield of the control group corresponding to 8,128 kg (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Because the mean milk yield of the offspring cows
were 111.2% and 88.9% of the control group means, they were considered to possess
similar milk production performance as the control cows. Furthermore, because the
offspring cows did not possess identical genes to the somatic cell cloned cow or the
same reproductive background, a generalized comparison could not be made with the donor
cow. However, for reference, the offspring cows produced 82.0% and 65.6% of the mean
milk yield produced by the donor cow. Although the milk production performance of Cody 2
was considerably reduced, the offspring of Cody 2 had normal milk production
performance. A variance of 7.1&#x2013;16.7 kg in the transition of monthly milk yield between
the offspring cows and Cody 2 during their first lactation period was verified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>), representing a substantial difference
in milk production characteristics. Accordingly, the abnormalities in milk production
performance seen in the somatic cell clone, Cody 2, were not observed in the offspring
of Cody 2.</p>
    <p>The inconsistencies found in milk fat ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.
1</xref>) could be largely attributed to seasonal factors and roughage quality.
Proteins and SNF ratios were stable, with little deviations. Typical milk compositions
for domestic cows are 85%&#x2013;88% water, 3.0%&#x2013;4.0% crude proteins, 4.6%&#x2013;5.2% lactose and
3.0%&#x2013;5.0% fats [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Mean milk compositions in
both the offspring and Cody 2 were within the normal range, as outlined by Walstra
[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], suggesting that there were no
abnormalities in the milk composition levels in either the offspring or their somatic
cell cloned cow. According to Tian [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the milk
and meat compositions of somatic cell cloned cattle did not differ from those of regular
cattle.</p>
    <p>In this study, abnormalities in reproduction or milk production performances were not
observed in the offspring of the somatic cell cloned cow, and the collected data
constituted additional pieces of evidence that the offspring of the cloned cow were
healthy. DNA microarray analysis has been performed to determine the precise genome-wide
gene expression profiles of somatic cloned mice [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The results demonstrated unexpectedly large epigenetic diversity in
neonatal cloned mice, despite their normal appearance and genetic identity. Therefore,
gene expression may be aberrantly controlled in the somatic cell cloned cow with low
reproductive performance and milk production. Gluckman reported that a part of the
epigenetic changes in the mammalian fetus is transmitted to progeny [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the abnormal phenotype in somatic
cell cloned mice was not transmitted to their offspring [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Somatic cell cloned animal
progeny can eliminate differences in the epigenetic changes by gametogenic reprogramming
[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, the abnormalities of the
parent somatic cell cloned Holstein cow did not persist in the two offspring, which
would have happened by conventional breeding.</p>
    <p>Somatic cell cloned cows do not constitute safety and quality issues related to meat and
milk as food products. However, because the consumer&#x2019;s confidence in cloned food items
is still uncertain, the distribution of meat or milk products produced through somatic
cell cloning technology remains largely disregarded in Japan even today. Despite this,
cloning technology allows for fast arrangement of highly productive cattle groups, and
it can be greatly beneficial to highly increase the production efficiency of milk and
meat. In this study, the offspring of a somatic cell cloned cow demonstrated healthy and
normal milk production performance; therefore, these cloned offspring may be used for
industrial food production. Using cloning technology, such problems as the global food
crisis may potentially be solved, and species that are extinct can potentially be
revived. Therefore, we hope that cloning technology will be utilized once again in Japan
in the future.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>In this study, somatic cell cloned embryos were successfully produced on the basis of
a previous report [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Briefly, femoral
fibroblasts of an 11-year-old Holstein dairy cow from Koiwai Farm were used as donor
cells for somatic cell cloned embryos. These embryos were then transferred into
recipient cows in the same farm facility. Two cloned Holstein cows, Cody 1 and Cody
2, were derived from femoral fibroblasts of the donor Holstein cow with the somatic
cell cloning technique. Birth weights (BW) and other after-birth data of the
offspring of Cody 2 and of Cody 2 are shown in the pedigree charts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p> Birth weights (BW) and other after-birth data of the somatic cell cloned
Holstein cow (Cody 2) and the offspring are shown in the pedigree
charts. *&#x2009;Holstein cow derived from multiple ovulations for Cody 2 and
embryo transfer. ** Holstein cow and calf derived from artificial
insemination (AI) for Cody 2.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jrd-59-595-g002"/></fig>). Heifers CO1 and CO2 were the offspring of Cody 2. CO1 was born after
multiple ovulation treatments on Cody 2 and embryo transfer into recipient cows,
whereas CO2 was born through artificial insemination (AI) of Cody 2. In addition,
the sires of CO1 and CO2 differed. Growth performance of the two somatic cell cloned
heifers did not differ from that of other cattle born within the same month, with no
specific apparent clinical abnormalities.</p>
      <p>The second generation offspring of the somatic cell clone heifers calved
successfully, with CO1 producing a male Japanese Black crossbred calf in the first
parturition and then producing a female Holstein calf via AI in the second
parturition. Both calves appeared normal and healthy at birth. CO2 delivered a
stillbirth male Japanese Black crossbred calf in the second calving.</p>
      <p>Reproduction and milk production data were collected from the donor cow (first&#x2013;sixth
lactation), Cody 2 (first&#x2013;third lactation), CO1 and CO2 (first&#x2013;second lactation).
Milking cows from Koiwai Farm (563 cows with a mean parity of 2.6) were used as the
control group. The primipara age of the month and calving intervals (days) were
collected as reproduction data. The calving intervals (days) of the donor Holstein
cow (first&#x2013;sixth lactation period) and the control group were 523 days and 427 days,
respectively. The reproduction performance was particularly reduced in the two
somatic cell cloned Holstein heifers [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
      <p>For milk productivity, data for the lactation curve and transitions of monthly milk
compositions during the first lactation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.
1</xref>) were collected on the basis of the dairy herd performance test every
month. The milk yield (kg) over 305 days and milk composition rates (fat, protein
and SNF) for each lactation period were measured (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In addition, the cows were milked twice per
day. The mean milk yield and milk composition rates (fat, protein and SNF) of the
donor Holstein cow from the first to sixth lactation periods were 11,015 kg and
3.5%, 3.2% and 8.7%, respectively, whereas they were 8,128 kg and 3.7%, 3.3% and
8.9%, respectively, for the control group.</p>
