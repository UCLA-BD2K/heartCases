        <p>Immunosuppressive drugs and biological agents may represent a potential risk of
lymphoma development in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. But most cases are
diffuse, large B-cell lymphomas. Primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium-sized
pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma, a provisional entity in the 2005 WHO-EORTC
classification of cutaneous lymphomas, is only described in a limited number of
reports. To our knowledge, our case is a rare instance of primary cutaneous CD4+
small/medium-sized pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma, after associated treatment with
methotrexate and etanercept, in a patient with moderate rheumatoid arthritis who
had undergone an orchidectomy incorrectly.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Duration of exposure to immunosuppressive drugs may represent a potential risk of
lymphoma development in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Biologic response
modifiers have also been associated with a possible risk of lymphoproliferative
disease.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> We describe a
rare case of primary cutaneous CD4 positive small/medium-sized pleomorphic T-cell
lymphoma (PCSM-TCL), after the associated treatment with methotrexate and etanercept
in a patient with RA.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A 62-year-old man had had dark purple nodules and plaques on the face, trunk and
bilateral extremities for 8 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).
He received a definite diagnosis of RA with moderate disease activity 2 years ago,
and responded unsatisfactorily to a 3-month course of methotrexate at 10 mg/wk.
Therapeutic regimens were then converted to associated treatment with etanercept
25mg biweekly for the next 3 months. Over the third month only, the patient
developed non-tender, bilateral cervical and groin lymphadenopathy and felt gradual
nasal obstruction. Microscopic examination of the enlarged lymph node revealed
diffuse effacement of the normal nodal architecture by an infiltrate composed of
small lymphocytes and macrophages. Nasal mucosa biopsy also revealed numerous
lymphoid cells, infiltrated in the dermis. However, the immunohistochemistry showed
a polyclonal mixture of lymphocytes. The disorder was therefore thought to represent
non-specific inflammation. Because of improvement in joint symptoms, etanercept was
continued singly and the dosage was reduced to once weekly for the next 3 months.
Due to swelling and gradual bilateral testicular pain, the treatment finally ended.
But the groin lymphadenopathy and swollen testes did not resolve following drug
withdrawal. Thus, the patient underwent an orchiectomy at the local hospital for
presumed testicular neoplasm. Histopathologic examination of the testes tissue
revealed folliculus lymphaticus formation and many lymphocytes infiltrated around
the epididymis duct. Immunophenotyping indicated positive reactions for: CD3, CD43,
CD4, CD8 (partly), CD20 (partly), CD79a (partly), CD38 (partly) and Ki-67 (&lt;1%).
Clonal TCR gene rearrangements were negative. Lymphoma was not yet definite at that
time. One month later, after the orchiectomy, rufous papules emerged firstly on his
face; dark purple nodules and plaques then broke out, spreading to the trunk and
bilateral extremities. Physical examination revealed numerous, enlarged, superficial
lymph nodes in the groin region. A complete blood count and immunoglobulin levels
were normal. A bone marrow biopsy and whole body computed tomography scan resulted
negative. Histopathologic examination of the skin nodule on the back revealed an
uninvolved epidermis and sheets of small to medium-sized lymphocytes with mild
atypia, infiltrated in nodular or diffuse distribution in the dermis, affecting part
of the eccrine glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).
Immunohistochemistry showed the infiltrative lymphocytes to be strongly positive for
CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7 and CD45RO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).
Furthermore, staining was focally positive for CD68, CD20, CD79a, CD8, but negative
for CD30, CD56, TIA-1, CD23 and Granzyme B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure
2</xref>). The proliferation rate was 50%, based on Ki-67 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA
(EBER-1) in situ hybridization demonstrated negative reactivity. Analysis of the
T-cell receptor gamma (TCR-&#x3B3;) gene rearrangement, using PCR, showed
monoclonal rearrangement. A diagnosis of PCSM-TCL was advanced, drawing on the
immunophenotype characterization of the infiltrative tumor cells (monomorphic sheets
of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8+ T and B cells were both rare) and the result of
clonal TCR-&#x3B3; gene rearrangement. Since the patient presented persistent
waxing and waning of cutaneous nodules but no evidence of systemic involvement, we
continued to follow him up without administering any systemic cytotoxic drugs, only
low-dose corticosteroids. At the time of writing, the patient was still alive and
most of the lesions had disappeared spontaneously.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p><bold>PCSM-TCL</bold> is a provisional entity in the 2005 WHO-EORTC classification of
cutaneous lymphomas, defined by a predominance of small to medium-sized pleomorphic
CD4-positive T cells, infiltrated in the dermis, without the typical
clinicopathologic features of mycosis fungoides. Clinically, it is characterized by
single or multiple solitary skin plaque(s) and/or nodule(s) on the face, neck and
upper trunk. Histopathologic features include dense dermal infiltrates, consisting
primarily of small/medium-sized pleomorphic T cells and less than 30% large
pleomorphic cells. Epidermotropism is rare, but the infiltrate may extend into the
subcutis. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrates, by definition, a
CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD30<sup>-</sup>, CD8<sup>-</sup> phenotype,
and monoclonal T-cell expansion is often exhibited by TCR gene rearrangement
studies.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Grogg et al. reported that compared to 20% for unspecified primary cutaneous
peripheral T-cell lymphoma, PCSM-TCL had an indolent clinical behavior with a
relatively favorable 5-year survival rate of 60-80%.<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Similarly, Baum et al. suggested that PCSM-TCL
entailed clinically indolent behavior whilst lacking the systemic findings
documented in the recent literature.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
<bold>Thus</bold>, it is necessary to distinguish PCSM-TCL from other lymphoma types
through careful clinicopathologic correlation, and avoid unnecessary treatment for
these patients. Cetin&#xF6;zman et al. reported that programmed death-1 (PD-1)
could serve as a useful diagnostic marker to differentiate between PCSM-TCL and
cutaneous pseudo-T-cell lymphomas on the one hand, and other types of cutaneous
T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) on the other.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The mechanism that accounts for increased incidence of lymphoma in RA patients is not
well established and there is an ongoing debate in the field of rheumatology about
whether the potentially toxic medications used to treat RA are responsible for the
increased risk of lymphoma, or whether the chronic inflammation itself (especially
with long-standing and severe disease) is still responsible.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In this case, the disease grade for
RA was only moderate, while the inchoate lymphoma symptoms, including cervical/groin
lymphadenopathy and nasal obstruction, occurred immediately after the employment of
immunosuppressive and biological agents. Hence, the medicines may have been the most
likely cause of PCSM-TCL in this case. Dermatologists should be aware of the
potential adverse reactions when treating severe psoriasis - as well as other
inflammatory dermatologic diseases - with immunosuppressive drugs or biologic
response modifiers.</p>
