  <body>
    <p>The patient is a 56-year-old male from the city of S&#xE3;o Paulo, with atrial septal
defect (ASD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension, who was hospitalized due to dyspnea,
hypoxemia and lower limb edema.</p>
    <p>In September 1996, the patient sought the Hospital do Cora&#xE7;&#xE3;o for the first
time due to fatigue on strenuous exertion for two months and chest X ray diagnosis of
enlarged heart area.</p>
    <p>His physical examination (September 11, 1996) revealed heart rate of 80 bpm and arterial
blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg. His pulmonary auscultation was normal. His cardiac
auscultation showed a fixed and wide splitting of the second heart sound, and systolic
heart murmur (+/4+) on the left sternal border.</p>
    <p>He was diagnosed with ASD and pulmonary arterial hypertension.</p>
    <p>The electrocardiogram (ECG - 1996) revealed right ventricular overload (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
    <p>
<fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>ECG (1996). Sinus rhythm, right ventricular overload.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="abc-106-03-0250-g01"/></fig>
</p>
    <p>The chest X ray showed bulging of the pulmonary artery, reduced pulmonary circulation and
cardiomegaly (+/4+).</p>
    <p>The echocardiogram (December 1996) revealed: septum and posterior wall thickness, 8 mm;
left ventricular (LV) diameters (diastolic/systolic) of 50/30 mm; aortic, left atrial
and right ventricular (RV) diameters of 35 mm, 40 mm and 54 mm, respectively; normal LV
segmentary motility; RV hypokinesia; normal valves; and estimated pulmonary artery
pressure of 84 mm Hg.</p>
    <p>The pulmonary perfusion scan (1997) was interpreted as of low probability of pulmonary
thromboembolism, and compatible with pulmonary hypertension.</p>
    <p>The cardiac catheterization (July 22, 1997) revealed: ASD; pulmonary arterial
hypertension; no obstructive coronary lesion; mild compression of the left main coronary
artery by the pulmonary trunk; and LV hypertrophy with moderate diffuse hypokinesia.

    <p>The pulmonary hypertension was considered disproportional to the left-right shunt, and
ASD correction was not indicated.</p>
    <p>Warfarin, digoxin, furosemide and captopril were prescribed.</p>
    <p>Other laboratory findings were as follows: hemoglobin, 19.3 g/dL; hematocrit, 56%;
platelets, 176,000/mm<sup>3</sup>; and leukocytes, 8,000/mm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
    <p>The patient remained stable with dyspnea on strenuous exertion until 2006, when he was 49
years old.</p>
    <p>His laboratory tests in December 2005 showed: hemoglobin, 21.6 g/dL; hematocrit, 66%;
platelets, 146,000/mm<sup>3</sup>; INR, 1.9; total cholesterol, 136 mg/dL; HDL, 45
mg/dL; LDL, 77 mg/dL; triglycerides, 68 mg/dL; glucose, 82 mg/dL; creatinine, 1 mg/dL;
potassium, 4.4 mEq/L; sodium, 143 mEq/L; D dimer &lt; 25 ng/mL.</p>
    <p>The chest tomography showed signs of pulmonary emphysema, but no sign of pulmonary
thromboembolism, suggesting pulmonary arterial hypertension.</p>
    <p>The pulmonary function test (December 29, 2005) revealed: FVC= 2.77 L (94%);
FEV<sub>1</sub>= 3.09 L (66%); FEF 25%-75%= 3.32 (32). After the bronchodilator:
FVC= 3.81 L (101%); FEV<sub>1</sub>= 2.3 L (74%); FEF 25%-75%= 1.25 (38%). That result
is compatible with mild obstruction (FEV1) and a marked reduction in the intermediate
stage of breathing, FEF 25%-75%, compatible with obstruction of the small airways.</p>
    <p>In June 2006, he experienced worsening of his dyspnea and chest pain, the diagnostic
hypothesis of pulmonary thromboembolism being considered.</p>
    <p>The pulmonary angiotomography (June 30, 2006) showed a filling gap in the lower lobe
branch of the left pulmonary artery and another filling gap in the upper segmental
branch to the left and parietal calcifications; mosaic perfusion area in the region;
moderate pleural effusion on the left; and cardiomegaly. The measurements were as
follows: pulmonary trunk, 47.9 mm; right pulmonary artery branch, 41 mm; left pulmonary
artery branch, 36.2 mm.</p>
    <p>One year after that episode, the patient sought medical care because of pain in the left
hemithorax and cough.</p>
    <p>The new tomography revealed a large thrombus in the pulmonary trunk, extending to the
left and interlobar descending branch, eccentric, with marginal calcifications. In
addition, the following were observed: smaller, marginal, distal thrombus in the right
pulmonary artery; heterogeneous opacities and diffuse septal thickening in the left lung
base; and pleural effusion to the left. The RV diameter/LV diameter ratio was close to
1. The measures were as follows: pulmonary trunk, 38.9 mm; right pulmonary artery, 42.4
mm; left pulmonary artery, 37.4 mm.</p>
    <p>The patient was diagnosed with chronic pulmonary thromboembolism and pneumonia.
Levofloxacin was prescribed.</p>
    <p>The echocardiogram (July 12, 2007) showed marked biventricular systolic dysfunction,
marked RV dilation and full-contrast filling of the cavity. No thrombus was visualized,
and the RV outflow tract was dilated. Marked dilation of the pulmonary trunk and
branches was identified, as was an echodense filamentous image in the pulmonary trunk
suggestive of a thrombus. There was diffuse LV hypokinesia, and the emergence of the
left coronary artery and its bifurcation were visualized, apparently with no sign of
compression. In addition, marked dilation of the atria, moderate tricuspid regurgitation
(could be underestimated due to RV dysfunction), moderate mitral regurgitation and
bilateral pleural effusion were observed.</p>
    <p>Two months later (September 2007), the patient sought the emergency of InCor with dyspnea
at rest, tachycardia, hepatomegaly, ascitis and lower limb edema. The ECG showed atrial
tachycardia. Congestive heart failure was diagnosed, requiring the use of intravenous
dobutamine and furosemide, compensation being achieved. Spironolactone and amiodarone
were added to the medications.</p>
    <p>A new cardiac catheterization (September 2007) revealed: pulmonary artery pressure of
80/32 mm Hg (mean, 50 mm Hg); no coronary lesion; and diffuse, moderate-to-severe LV
hypokinesia.</p>
    <p>The patient was discharged with the prescription of furosemide (60 mg/day),
spironolactone (25 mg/day), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/day), amiodarone (200 mg/day),
warfarin (2.5 mg), clopidogrel (75 mg/day), omeprazol (40 mg/day) and fluid restriction
of 1800 mL/day.</p>
    <p>On the following month (October 2007), the patient was hospitalized again due to cardiac
decompensation, when hypothyroidism was detected.</p>
    <p>The new echocardiography (October 2007) showed right chamber dilation, ASD of 35 mm,
moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, RV systolic pressure of 66 mm Hg, and
dilation of the pulmonary arteries.</p>
    <p>The abdominal ultrasonography (October 10, 2007) showed hepatomegaly with mild steatosis.
Sildenafil (40 mg, 3x/day) was introduced, and the patient developed fatigue on
strenuous exertion.</p>
    <p>On physical examination (July 2011), the patient had a healthy coloring, was in a good
general state of health, hydrated, cyanotic (3+/4+), anicteric, afebrile, eupneic. His
room air saturation was 80%, heart rate, 76 bpm, arterial blood pressure, 120/80 mm Hg,
and his chest anteroposterior diameter was enlarged. His pulmonary auscultation was
normal. His cardiac auscultation revealed increased intensity of the second heart sound
on the pulmonary area, and no heart murmur. The abdomen was normal, and there was no
edema.</p>
    <p>The ECG (2011) showed sinus rhythm with right ventricular overload (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
    <p>

</p>
    <p>The angiotomography of the pulmonary arteries (May 2011) revealed dilation of the
pulmonary trunk (43 mm) and of the right and left pulmonary artery braches (37 mm and
36mm, respectively), suggesting pulmonary hypertension. The pulmonary trunk had parietal
calcifications. There were circumferential contrast-filling defects, compatible with
mural thrombi, in the left branch of the pulmonary trunk and ipsilateral interlobar
artery. In addition, there was a filling defect associated with marked thinning of the
left bronchial arteries of the upper lobe and of the arteries of the left basal
segments, except for the artery of the posterior basal segment, findings compatible with
previous thromboembolisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>). (<bold>Antonio Fernando Lins de Paiva, MD,

</p>
    <p>The new echocardiogram (September 2011) was similar to that of 2007, except for the ASD
size, which measured 24 mm. There was a mild reduction in the LV ejection fraction
(LVEF= 52%).</p>
    <p>Bosentan (125 mg, 2x/day) was added to the treatment, and the patient remained in
functional class II until the end of 2012.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of 2013, due to dyspnea worsening and an episode of pain in the left
hemithorax, the patient sought help at a hospital close to his house, where he underwent
bloodletting, and improved. His hematocrit was 67%.</p>
    <p>The patient was admitted to the emergency unit on June 1, 2013, complaining of dyspnea
worsening for 2 days, even on minimum exertion. He associated his symptoms with flu
findings. He reported abdominal volume increase, lower limb edema, cyanosis worsening,
reduced urine output, coughing up white mucus, and runny nose.</p>
    <p>His examination showed: oxygen saturation blood test, 68%; heart rate, 85 bpm; arterial
pressure, 99/60 mmHg; cyanosis, 3+/4+; diffusely reduced respiratory sounds with
crepitant rales on the bases. The cardiac auscultation revealed reduced intensity of the
rhythmic heart sounds, and fixed second heart sound splitting. The abdomen showed signs
of ascitis and liver palpable 3 cm from the right costal border. There was lower limb
edema (2+/4+). Dobutamine was administered (5 mcg/kg/min), being reduced to 3.3
mcg/kg/min on the following day, due to improved hemodynamic findings. Oseltamivir was
used because of the previous history of flu.</p>
    <p>The ECG showed right bundle-branch block and right ventricular overload (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

</p>
    <p>The chest X ray (June 01, 2013) showed an enlarged hilum, reduced peripheral lung
vascularization, pulmonary bulging, heart enlargement (4+/4+) at the expense of the RV
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

      <title>Clinical aspects</title>
      <p>The ASD is the most common congenital heart disease in adulthood. It is characterized
by a communication between the atria, being classified into four types
(<italic>ostium primum, ostium secundum, sinus venosus</italic> and defect
involving the coronary <italic>sinus</italic>). Only the <italic>ostium
secundum</italic> defects are true ASD. The other types originate from defects
in other structures, causing a communication between the atrial cavities.</p>
      <p>The <italic>ostium secundum</italic> ASD is the most commonly found, corresponding to
80% of the cases, and results from the excessive resorption of the <italic>septum
primum</italic> or deficient growth of the <italic>septum
secundum</italic>.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>
      <p>It usually has an insidious clinical presentation. The communication between the
atria causes left-to-right shunt since birth; however, most children are
asymptomatic. The malformation is detected on physical examination because of the
presence of a systolic heart murmur on the left sternal border. Thus, the symptoms
usually begin in adolescents or young adults. At the fifth decade of life, 75% to
80% of the patients are symptomatic.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Our patient is a 56-year-old male diagnosed with ASD after the appearance of right
heart failure symptoms. The diagnosis was late, when pulmonary hypertension
secondary to that congenital malformation had already installed. At that stage, the
patient already had reverse right-to-left shunt, and ASD correction was
contraindicated.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Surgical correction is indicated in the presence of a significant ASD or associated
right ventricular overload, even when symptomless. The correction should be
carefully assessed, because, when performed at a late stage, they can cause serious
complications.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
      <p>When inadvertent, the ASD correction may worsen pulmonary hypertension, because the
right-to-left shunt closure can increase pulmonary arterial pressure, aggravating
the right heart failure. In addition, in more advanced cases, in which LV systolic
dysfunction is associated, ASD closure increases pulmonary capillary pressure,
causing pulmonary edema.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Some parameters, such as normal oxygen saturation at rest or exertion, left-to-right
shunt on echocardiography, and systolic pulmonary artery pressure lower than 70
mmHg, should be assessed before indicating ASD correction.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> None of these parameters were present in our
patient.</p>
      <p>To our patient, who had a late diagnosis of ASD complicated with pulmonary
hypertension, surgical correction was contraindicated. The unrepaired ASD resulted
in reverse right-to-left shunt, progressing to Eisenmenger syndrome, the final stage
of pulmonary obstructive vascular disease secondary to the preexisting left-to-right
shunt.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The Eisenmenger syndrome is associated with several complications: arrhythmias, heart
failure, pulmonary and systemic thrombosis, hemoptysis, renal dysfunction, cerebral
abscess, gout and biliary lithiasis.<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
      <p>At the time our patient was diagnosed, he already had right heart failure and RV
dysfunction. As the disease progressed, episodes of pulmonary arterial thrombosis
occurred. The prevalence of thrombosis is high in that population due to the
hypoxemia that results in secondary polycythemia, and, consequently, higher risk for
thrombosis. The chance of pulmonary arterial thrombosis is suggested to increase
with age, probably due to the progression of endothelial dysfunction over
time.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Thus, to a patient
at low risk for bleeding, anticoagulation should be discussed, even before
thrombosis manifests.</p>
      <p>The patient was medicated for heart failure, and oral anticoagulation was initiated
even before the manifestation of pulmonary arterial thrombosis. He remained stable
for 10 years, and, during which, his medication was optimized with the later
introduction of pulmonary vasodilators. These drugs are essential to treat the
Eisenmenger syndrome, improving functional class, increasing tolerance to exercise
and improving performance on the 6-minute walking test.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Despite adequate drug treatment, our patient's clinical status progressively
worsened, and he died due to disease complications (heart failure and pulmonary
arterial thrombosis).</p>
      <p>This case shows the importance of the early diagnosis of ASD, allowing the repair of
the congenital defect timely, before complications occur.</p>

      <title>Postmortem examination</title>
      <p>The heart was enlarged and globoid, weighing 832 g. On gross examination, the RV was
prominent. The opening of the cavities evidenced eccentric hypertrophy of the four
chambers, mainly the right ones, which showed marked dilation. A large ASD was
identified in the <italic>fossa ovalis</italic> (<italic>ostium secundum</italic>
type), measuring 3.5 x 3.0 cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>). The
ventricular septum was intact, no other heart malformation being identified. The
microscopic examination revealed hypertrophy of the cardiomyocytes and myocardial
interstitial fibrosis in both ventricles, with no evidence of ischemic lesions
(infarction). The pulmonary trunk was dilated (diameter of 4.0 cm) and showed
complicated atherosclerosis, with calcified areas. The right pulmonary artery showed
calcified atherosclerosis, organized partial thrombosis, and markedly dilation of
its parenchymatous branches. The process was similar in the left lung, but the
thrombosis was more extensive, affecting numerous arterial branches, in an occlusive
way, including the pulmonary hilum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9</xref>).
The microscopic examination of the lungs confirmed the extensive organizing arterial
thrombosis detected on gross examination, in addition to revealing: organized and
rechanneled arteriolar thrombosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Figure 10</xref>);
recent focal thrombosis of a small artery and small hemorrhagic infarction in the
lower lobe of the right lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f11">Figure 11</xref>);
areas of alveolar hemorrhage; anthracosis; microscopic evidence of chronic
bronchitis; and diffuse pulmonary emphysema. In addition, a small <italic>in
situ</italic> adenocarcinoma was found in the right lung, measuring 9 mm.
Moderate aorta atherosclerosis was identified, with calcified plaques. Neither
pneumothorax nor bronchopneumonia were evidenced.</p>

      <p>The patient was a 56-year-old male with wide ASD, marked secondary pulmonary
hypertension and Eisenmenger syndrome. He was initially cared for at our service at
the age of 37 years, when diagnosed with congenital heart defect. On that occasion,
he already had marked pulmonary hypertension, and no indication for surgical repair.
The surgical repair of congenital heart defects that progress with pulmonary
hypertension should be early, before the latter acquires greater importance,
becoming irreversible. Under certain circumstances, pulmonary biopsy is performed to
grade hypertension, contributing to assess the possibility of surgical
repair.<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Our patient progressed with congestive heart
failure, polycythemia with marked hematocrit increase and episodes of thrombosis of
pulmonary arteries. In addition, there was an inversion of the flow through the ASD
(right-to-left), characterizing Einsenmenger syndrome.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The postmortem examination confirmed the large ASD and pulmonary hypertension. There
was marked dilation of the pulmonary arteries and branches, with extensive organized
thrombosis, affecting the hilar vessels. These findings can occur in pulmonary
hypertension of any etiology, but, in our case, the thrombosis was exuberant,
probably related to the marked increase in the patient's hematocrit and
prothrombotic state, described in the adult's Eisenmenger syndrome.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> It is worth noting that, under those circumstances, there is
thrombosis rather than thromboembolism of the pulmonary arteries, because it is a
local phenomenon and not embolization of thrombi formed in another vascular
territory. Death resulted from cardiogenic shock, due to heart failure and extensive
thrombosis of the pulmonary arteries, aggravated by hemorrhagic pulmonary
infarction.</p>
