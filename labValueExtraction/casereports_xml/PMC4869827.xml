        <p>This study reports a case of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist trigger in a
young female with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who underwent fertility preservation
using random-start controlled ovarian stimulation. This method involves the
stimulation of the ovary regardless of a patient's menstrual-cycle phase. A review of
the related literature is also provided. A 17-year-old patient was diagnosed with MDS
and required initiation of peripheral blood stem cell transplantation within a
maximum of 3 weeks and was in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle when the
possibility of attempting preservation of fertility was presented to her. She opted
for a random-start controlled ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins. With successful
hemorrhagic prophylaxis, 17 oocytes were retrieved including 10 mature and 7 immature
oocytes. Of the immature oocytes, 3 were successfully matured <italic>in
vitro</italic> and a vitrification protocol was used to freeze the 13 mature
oocytes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) includes a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic
stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and by bone marrow and
peripheral blood morphological findings (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Many
cases of MDS have no symptoms and are diagnosed during a routine blood count test. The
most prominent clinical features are anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Patients with MDS can develop severe anemia and
require blood transfusion. This disorder has a variable risk of transformation into
acute leukemia and is considered a pre-leukemic state. Hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation is thought to be a safe and effective option for patients with MDS.
However, conditioning regimens always include high-doses of the antimetabolic agent
cytarabine, which is harmful to the ovary. In a study on the incidence of and risk
factors for fertility impairment, infertility was suspected in 83% of survivor women
after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in childhood and adolescence (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Thus, the need is evident for an effective
fertility preservation strategy that would allow these patients the possibility to
conceive a child with their own gametes.</p>
      <p>Currently, different strategies for fertility preservation in women, including embryo
and oocyte cryopreservation, and ovary cryopreservation, are available. Ovarian tissue
cryopreservation requires surgical procedures. Moreover, there is a risk for the
malignant cell contamination of the graft, with reintroduction of the disease,
particularly for hematological cancer diseases (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Oocyte cryopreservation is indicated for postpubertal females that seek to
delay pregnancy for a variety of reasons. In patients with MDS who need to start
cytotoxic treatment soon, one of the biggest challenges in fertility preservation is the
time required to complete the ovarian stimulation therapy. In these cases, protocols
with alternative timing to start controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) have been
proposed. Here, we report a case of a successful emergency oocyte cryopreservation in a
young woman with MDS who was scheduled to undergo human leukocyte-associated antigen
partially mismatched peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). As the PBSCT
had to be initiated within a maximum of 3 weeks, the patient opted for random-start COS
with gonadotropins during the luteal phase of the cycle with a satisfactory
response.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Case report</title>
      <p>In 2009, a 17-year-old patient was referred to a local hospital with the complaint of
persistent menorrhagia. Results of laboratory tests revealed thrombocytopenia (platelet
count: 3.8&#xD7;10<sup>4</sup>/&#xB5;L). No family history of hematologic disorder was reported.
Later she developed pancytopenia. Her bone marrow aspirate smear showed dysplastic
features in trilineage cells without an increase in blast cells. Results of the
cytogenetic study and the chromosome fragility test were negative. She needed repetitive
blood transfusions. The oncologist performed leukocyte-associated antigen tests in the
patient and her father, and PBSCT was planned and scheduled. After being informed and
extensively counselled by a reproductive specialist with regard to oocyte
cryopreservation, the patient decided to begin random-start COS for collection and
preservation of gametes. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Peking
University People's hospital. Informed consent was obtained from the patient and her
parents.</p>
      <p>The details of initial antral follicle count by ultrasound examination and hormonal
assessment of the patient are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table
1</xref>. In light of her imminent PBSCT, the patient did not have sufficient time to
wait for the onset of the next menstrual cycle and the success of COS using conventional
methods was unlikely. Alternatively, she immediately started treatment with recombinant
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH; Gonal-f; Sero, Germany) at a daily dosage of 225 IU.
On day 20 of the menstrual cycle, dosages of FSH were adjusted based on estradiol
(E<sub>2</sub>) levels and follicle size, to maximize follicular response. At
approximately day 8 of gonadotropin stimulation, her follicles were consistently
developed, with the lead follicles of about 12 mm, and on the same day, the serum
luteinizing hormone (LH) level was 1.80 IU/L. Due to the absence of a premature LH
surge, no gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist was administered. A single
dose of 0.2 mg GnRH agonist (triptorelin; Ferring GmbH, Germany) was administered after
10 days of stimulation when the largest three follicles attained a mean diameter of 17
mm, with general cohort follicles &gt;13 mm. The serum LH value was 0.71 IU/L on the day
of ovulation. Transvaginal retrieval was performed 35 h after the administration of the
GnRH agonist.</p>

</p>
      <p>In the surgical room, the patient was sedated with pethidine hydrochloride (25 mg;
Qinghai pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., China.) <italic>im</italic>, and perioperative
antibiotics were administered (1.5 g cefuroxime sodium; Esseti Farmaceutici SRL, ltaly)
immediately after sedation. A narrow ultrasound transducer (17G Oocyte Recovery Set;
Smiths Medical International Ltd., UK) with an affixed needle guide was inserted
vaginally, permitting transvaginal ovarian cyst puncture and aspiration. Seventeen
oocytes were obtained. The patient was discharged after overnight observation without
related complications. After 5 days, the patient had menstruation.</p>
      <p>Of the 17 cumulus-oocyte complexes retrieved, 10 were mature and 7 immature. The
immature oocytes were matured <italic>in vitro</italic> (IVM) and subsequently
reassessed for maturity. Three of these oocytes attained nuclear maturity, and
vitrification protocol was used to freeze the 13 mature oocytes.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="discussion">
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present case report, 10 mature oocytes were retrieved after induction of
ovulation, in concordance with the study by Courbiere et al. (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Moreover, we were able to mature an additional 3 oocytes by IVM.
This satisfactory response supports the effectiveness of emergency fertility
preservation, in which oocytes can be obtained efficiently, irrespective of the phase of
the menstrual cycle, in an urgent situation.</p>
      <p>In a French multicenter cohort study, the leading indication for emergency <italic>in
vitro</italic> fertilization was hematological cancer (42%) (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, limited data about fertility preservation choices and
response to COS in patients with MDS are available in the literature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table 2</xref>). Reichman et al. (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) described a successful ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval
in a premenarcheal girl. A retrospective cohort study by Senapati et al. (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) reported 67 subjects with hematological disorders
(5 had MDS). Tsai et al. (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) reported a live
birth after single embryo transfer derived from autologous cryopreserved oocytes of a
patient with MDS who had undergone allogenic PBSCT.</p>

        <title>Controlled ovarian stimulation (COS)</title>
        <p>Conventionally, stimulation regimens in general infertility practice are started in
the early follicular phase or after the pituitary blockade with a GnRH agonist. The
ovarian stimulation for oocyte cryopreservation with GnRH antagonist is also
initiated at the beginning of the follicular phase, which may require 2&#x2013;6 weeks
depending on the patient's menstrual cycle day.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Random-start COS</title>
        <p>In situations in which anti-cancer treatments must be initiated urgently, it is not
desirable to wait for the next menstrual period to start a stimulation protocol; for
such cases, random-start COS protocols have been proposed (<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
        <p>The following treatment plans are adopted depending on the phase of the menstrual
cycles: If the patient is in the late follicular phase (menstrual cycle day 7 with
emergence of a dominant follicle &gt;13 mm, and/or progesterone level &lt;2 ng/mL),
ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins is started. When the secondary follicle cohort
following stimulation reaches 12 mm, pituitary suppression with GnRH antagonist is
initiated to prevent premature secondary LH surge and continued until the trigger
(<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). If the dominant follicle reaches 18 mm
in diameter, ovulation is induced with hCG or GnRH agonist. After 2&#x2013;3 days, the COS
is started. If the patient is in the early luteal phase (progesterone level &gt;3
ng/mL), ovarian stimulation is started without GnRH antagonist. The patient in the
present study presented herself in this phase. In this young female, a decreasing
trend in serum concentrations of LH was observed during the luteal phase. Hence,
there was no need to administer the additional GnRH antagonist. However, the present
protocol is different from the protocol suggested by Cakmak et al. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In their study, GnRH antagonist was
administered to prevent premature secondary LH surge when the lead follicle reached
12 mm and was continued until the trigger. However, our clinical experience
demonstrates that COS during the luteal phase resulted in lower serum LH
concentrations on the day of the ovulation trigger; no patients presented a premature
surge in LH. The suppression of LH secretion was likely the result of the increased
value of progesterone (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). High
concentrations of progesterone reduced the frequency of GnRH pulse, which further
inhibited the secretion of LH and the occurrence of the LH surge, even though the
circulating E<sub>2</sub> concentration approached the threshold level at which an LH
surge was generated by the positive feedback loop (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The protocol used was in line with the recent observation by Kuang et
al. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) who provided evidence for the
suppression of the luteal phase LH surge. This phenomenon simplifies ovarian
stimulation protocols and makes it easier to monitor the procedure.</p>
        <p>If the patient is in the mid-luteal phase, a GnRH antagonist is administered to
induce regression of corpus luteum. After that, serum progesterone levels decrease
and menses start 2&#x2013;4 days later; hence, COS is started earlier instead of awaiting
spontaneous menses (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p>
        <p>Some researchers have evaluated the outcome of ovarian stimulation following
conventional or random-start COS in patients with cancer. No differences were
observed in the total dose of gonadotropins, numbers of oocyte retrieved, metaphase
II oocytes when comparing the methods. The random-start approach was designed to
allow the collection of oocyte in the shortest time possible, and is reported to be
as effective as conventional COS (<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>The present paper reports a case of a successfully performed random-start COS, which
should be considered in patients who are not close to the first day of the menses and
need an emergency fertility preservation. However, the efficacy of the strategy,
especially in terms of future clinical pregnancy and live birth rates originating from
the cryopreserved oocytes, awaits further research.</p>
