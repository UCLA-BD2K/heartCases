      <abstract>
        <p>Dividing populations of stratified and simple  epithelial tissues express keratins 5 and 14, and keratins  8 and 18, respectively. It has been suggested that these  keratins form a mechanical framework important to  cellular integrity, since their absence gives rise to a blistering skin disorder in neonatal epidermis, and hemorrhaging within the embryonic liver. An unresolved fundamental issue is whether different keratins perform  unique functions in epithelia. We now address this  question using transgenic technology to express a K16-14 hybrid epidermal keratin transgene and a K18 simple epithelial keratin transgene in the epidermis of mice  null for K14. Under conditions where the hybrid epidermal keratin restored a wild-type phenotype to newborn epidermis, K18 partially but not fully rescued. The  explanation does not appear to reside in an inability of  K18 to form 10-nm filaments with K5, which it does in  vitro and in vivo. Rather, it appears that the keratin  network formed between K5 and K18 is deficient in  withstanding mechanical stress, leading to perturbations in the keratin network in regions of the skin that  are subjected either to natural or to mechanically induced trauma. Taken together, these findings suggest  that the loss of a type I epidermal keratin cannot be  fully compensated by its counterpart of simple epithelial cells, and that in vivo<italic>,</italic> all keratins are not equivalent.</p>

  <body>
    <p>K<sc>eratins</sc> belong to the superfamily of intermediate  filament (IF)<sup>1</sup> proteins, which have the remarkable capacity to assemble into 10-nm filaments in  vitro, in the absence of auxiliary proteins or factors (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Fuchs and Weber, 1994</xref>). They are composed of  two sequence types, both of which share a common,  largely &#x3B1;-helical secondary structure, capable of forming  coiled-coil heterodimers, which then further assemble to  form obligatory heteropolymers. Type I keratins include  K9-K20 and type II keratins encompass K1-K8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Moll et  al., 1982</xref>). While most combinations of type I and type II  keratins can copolymerize in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Franke et al., 1983</xref>),  keratins are often coexpressed as specific pairs in vivo,  where they are largely restricted to epithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Sun  et al., 1984</xref>).</p>
    <p>The innermost, mitotically active (basal) layer of many  stratified epithelial tissues, including the epidermis, cornea, and tongue, express the type II keratin K5 and the  type I keratin K14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Fuchs and Green, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Moll et al.,  1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Nelson and Sun, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Byrne et al., 1994</xref>). A second  natural partner for K5 is K15, which is more abundantly  expressed in internal stratified squamous epithelia, such as  esophagus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Moll et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Leube et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Lloyd et  al., 1995</xref>). As keratinocytes of stratified tissues withdraw  from the cell cycle and commit to differentiate, they often  downregulate transcription of K5/K14 (K5/K15); concomitantly, as the differentiating cells move into the upper layers, they induce one of five to six different pairs of keratin genes depending upon the particular stratified tissue  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Fuchs and Green, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Moll et al., 1982</xref>). In contrast to  these elaborate patterns in stratified tissues, simple epithelia express K8 and K18, and only under certain circumstances do they express additional keratins K7 and K19  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Moll et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Wu et al., 1982</xref>).</p>
    <p>One role that has been ascribed to the various keratin  filament networks of stratified squamous epithelia is to  impart mechanical integrity to cells, without which, the  cells become fragile and prone to rupturing. This function  was initially proposed on the basis of transgenic mice engineered to express a dominant-negative K14 mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Vassar et al., 1991</xref>), and it has been documented by K14 null  mutations identified in both mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Lloyd et al., 1995</xref>) and  humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Chan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Rugg et al., 1994</xref>). In all of  these cases, the skin displays features of epidermolysis  bullosa simplex (EBS), a blistering disorder typified by  basal epidermal cell rupturing upon mild mechanical stress  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Fitzpatrick et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Fuchs and Cleveland, 1998</xref>). Similarly, mice expressing a mutant version of the K10 gene,  normally expressed in differentiating epidermal cells, exhibit features of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (EH), a disorder analogous to EBS but involving suprabasal rather  than basal cell degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Fuchs et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Porter et  al., 1996</xref>). In humans, EBS and EH are generally autosomal dominant skin disorders, and correlate with the appearance of clumps or aggregates of keratin filaments in  the cell cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Anton-Lamprecht, 1994</xref>).</p>
    <p>It is now well established that these mechanically induced blistering disorders of the epidermis involve mutations in keratins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bonifas et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Coulombe et al.,  1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cheng et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Chipev et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Lane et al.,  1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Rothnagel et al., 1992</xref>). Recently, a number of other  keratin disorders have been identified genetically, and  they involve additional stratified epithelial tissues, including cornea, esophagus, and hair; they are characterized by  cell degeneration and mechanical fragility (for review see  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Fuchs and Cleveland, 1998</xref>). Where tested, the severity of  these diseases seems to correlate with the degree to which  the keratin mutants perturb IF assembly in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Letai et  al., 1993</xref>).</p>
    <p>Human disorders involving simple epithelial keratins  have not yet been established, although a K18 mutation  was reported recently in a patient with cryptogenic cirrhosis, a liver disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Ku and Omary, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Ku et al., 1997</xref>),  and transgenic mice expressing a mutant K18 develop  chronic hepatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Ku et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">1996</xref>). Simple epithelial  keratins may also function to maintain hepatocyte integrity as evidenced by (<italic>a</italic>) the death of some K8 null mouse  embryos resulting from hemorrhaging of the liver at the  time of vascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Baribault et al., 1993</xref>); (<italic>b</italic>) the liver  necrosis in adult K8 mice when subjected to hepatectomy  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Loranger et al., 1997</xref>); and (<italic>c</italic>) the signs of hepatitis seen  in adult K18 null mice, which also display K8 aggregates in  their hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Magin et al., 1998</xref>). Taken together,  these findings suggest a special importance of simple epithelial keratins in the liver. A role for K8/K18 in intestinal  epithelia has also surfaced in that one strain of K8 null  mice displays marked colorectal hyperplasia and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Baribault et al., 1994</xref>). Whether simple epithelial  keratins function to impart mechanical integrity, however,  is considerably less clear than it is for stratified epithelial  keratins.</p>
    <p>If keratins have comparable functions in different tissues, then what is the functional significance of the multiplicity of keratin sequences? Is it that keratin genes have  simply duplicated and diverged over evolution, but functionally the gene products are redundant? Or, did different keratin genes evolve to suit the particular functional  needs of the tissues in which they are expressed? To begin  to explore the answer to this fundamental issue of keratin  biology, we have used transgenic technology to replace  K14 with K18 gene expression in K14 null mice. We show  that while K18 can coassemble with K5 into a keratin filament network in vivo and in vitro, the keratin network is  unable to withstand mechanical trauma, giving rise to natural skin blistering in the paws and to mechanically induced blistering in the back. Our findings suggest that keratins within a single family type have specially tailored  properties and are not functionally redundant. They further support the notion that keratins have evolved to suit  the particular structural and functional needs of different  epithelial tissues.</p>

        <title>Generation of Transgenes</title>
        <p>A K14 transgene was generated using 2,100 bp of the human K14 promoter to drive expression of a hybrid human K16-14 cDNA. The hybrid  K16-14 cDNA was assembled from human K14 cDNA and human K16  cDNA. A conserved SphI site was used to engineer the hybrid cDNA, resulting in an encoded 49-kD protein containing 368 amino acid (a.a.) residues of human K16 and 105 a.a. of human K14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Wawersik et al., 1997</xref>). A  human K18 transgene was generated using 2,100 bp of human K14 promoter to drive expression of a full-length human K18 cDNA, provided by  Dr. R. Oshima (Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Oshima et al., 1986</xref>).  The 1,425-bp K18 cDNA was placed in a mammalian epidermal expression vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Vassar et al., 1989</xref>), modified to contain a globin intron sequence in the 5&#x2032; untranslated region.</p>

        <title>Engineering the K14 Null Mice Replaced by Either the  K14 or K18 Transgene</title>
        <p>Genetically engineered transgenes were microinjected into fertilized, single cell embryos (CD-1 for K18; B6C3 F2 for K16-14), and after culturing  the embryos to the two cell stage, they were transferred to the oviducts of  pseudopregnant female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Vassar et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Paladini and Coulombe,  1998</xref>). 3 wk after birth, ear or tail samples were taken for DNA analysis.  Presence of the transgene was determined by PCR or Southern blotting of  these DNAs. Mice expressing the transgenes were then bred to mice that  were null for the K14 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Lloyd et al., 1995</xref>). Genotyping was determined by Southern blot analysis and/or PCR using the conditions and  probes described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Lloyd et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Paladini and Coulombe, 1998</xref>).</p>

        <p>Intermediate filaments were isolated from skin samples as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Wu  et al., 1982</xref>), and keratins were solubilized in a solution of 8 M urea and  10% &#x3B2;-mercaptoethanol. Water-soluble proteins were concentrated at  4&#xB0;C with a Microcon 10 concentrator (Amicon W.R. Grace &amp; Co., Beverly, MA). After electrophoretic transfer of SDS-PAGE&#x2013;resolved IF proteins to nitrocellulose, blots were pre-incubated overnight in 1% gelatin  (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="sigma">Sigma Chemical Co.</named-content>, St. Louis, MO), 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM  NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20, followed by incubation with primary antibody  for 1 h and washing three times for 10 min each in PBS, 0.5% Tween-20.  After this procedure, blots were then developed using either a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and chemiluminescence ECL (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="amersham">Amersham  Corp.</named-content>, Arlington Heights, IL) or an alkaline phosphatase&#x2013;conjugated secondary antibody and color development (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).

To quantitate signals, blots were scanned into a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics,  Sunnyvale, CA), and protein levels were determined with ImageQuant  software (Molecular Dynamics).</p>

For conventional transmission electron microscopy, tissues were immediately fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% formaldehyde, pH 7.3, for 24 h, followed by postfixation  with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h. After en bloc staining and dehydration  with ethanol, the samples were embedded with LX-112 medium (Ladd  Research Industries, Burlington, Vermont). All tissues had been properly  oriented to ensure that the entire thickness of epidermis or mucous membrane would be sectioned perpendicular to the normal tissue plane. Semithin sections were stained with toluidine blue. Ultrathin sections of 80 nm  were cut with a diamond knife, mounted on uncoated grids, stained with  uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and then observed with a JEOL-CXII  electron microscope (JEOL USA, Inc., Peabody, MA) operated at 60 kv.</p>

Purified type I and type II keratins were mixed in a &#x223C;45: 55 molar ratio at a final concentration of 500 &#x3BC;g/ml in 6 M urea buffer, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and then fractionated by anion exchange chromatography on a <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="pharmacia">Pharmacia</named-content> Mono Q column (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="pharmacia">Pharmacia  Biotech, Inc.</named-content>, Piscataway, NJ).

        <p>To assay for tetramer formation, the K5-K18 and K5-K14 samples were  dialyzed against 25 mM sodium phosphate and 10 mM &#x3B2;-ME, containing  6 M or 8 M urea at pH 7.4, to remove Tris ions.

        <p>The hallmark of K14 null mice is that they display marked  blistering over their paws shortly after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Lloyd et al.,  1995</xref>). Our first aim was to determine if we could rescue  this phenotype by expressing a K14-like transgene using  2,100 bp of the human K14 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Vassar et al., 1989</xref>).  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows the rescue vector, which contains a significant  portion of human K16 coding sequence to facilitate its distinction by size from endogenous K14, and to facilitate  quantitation of transgene levels relative to endogenous  K14 levels. The hybrid retains the COOH-terminal epitope of K14, to which a peptide-specific antibody exists  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Stoler et al., 1988</xref>). Transgenic mice were generated by  standard procedures, and confirmed by Southern blot  analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Paladini and Coulombe, 1998</xref>). Mice from two  K16-14&#x2013;expressing lines were generated. Expression of  the hybrid K16-14 at &#x2264;75% relative to endogenous K14  levels does not cause any detectable alteration in the skin  of transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Paladini and Coulombe, 1998</xref>). </p>
        <p>To quantitate the levels of transgene expression for the  present study, we isolated the IF proteins from tail skins  and conducted SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot  analysis to detect the transgene product and the endogenous K14, both of which share identical COOH-terminal  sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The antibody detected an additional  49-kD band in the transgene skin extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> <italic>A</italic>) that  was not present in the wild-type skin extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> <italic>B</italic>).  The 52-kD band corresponding to endogenous K14 was  detected in both transgenic and wild-type skin extracts.  Densitometry scanning revealed that in mice heterozygous  for the K16-K14 transgene locus, the transgene product  was present at 17% &#xB1; 3% the level of K14 in the lower expressing line (shown) and at &#x223C;50% the level of K14 in the  higher expressing line (data not shown). These mice were  then bred to the K14 null animals to generate mice with a  basal epidermal layer null for K14 and positive for the  K16-14 transgene. Animals were genotyped by Southern  blot analysis.</p>
        <p>Mice from both K16-K14 transgenic/K14 null lines appeared normal at birth and exhibited no blistering over  their body or paws. Animals remained blister-free as they  became adults. A more detailed analysis of these mice will  be described elsewhere. Histological analysis revealed no  signs of epidermal abnormalities, even in the palmar region of the paws, subjected naturally to substantial mechanical stress (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> <italic>A</italic>). In palmar areas and elsewhere  throughout the K16-14 replacement skin, an ordered program of differentiation was observed, with mitotically active basal cells in the inner layer, spinous cells, granular  layer cells, and stratum corneum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). This  was in marked contrast to K14 null skin, which displayed  gross blistering within 2 d of birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Lloyd et al., 1995</xref>). Blistering was very bad in the palmar regions of K14 null skin  where rete ridges are typically seen (not shown), and was  prominent even in areas with hair follicles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> <italic>C</italic>). At  the histological level, clear cytoplasm and intraepidermal  rupturing was seen within the basal layer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> <italic>C</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Lloyd  et al., 1995</xref>). These findings demonstrate that in the presence of K16-14, the skin blistering phenotype typical of  neonatal K14 null mice was rescued. </p>
        <p>To investigate whether there might be more subtle aberrations in the basal cell cytoarchitecture of K16-14 transgenic/K14 null replacement epidermis, we examined the  skin by electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, replacement paw skin basal cells showed abundant keratin filaments (<italic>A</italic>), not seen in the K14 null cells (<italic>B</italic>). These filaments  associated with desmosomes and with hemidesmosomes,  as expected for wild-type keratin networks. Furthermore,  no signs of microscopic blistering were visible in these  samples. Overall, the macroscopic and microscopic appearance of the K16-14 skin was similar to that of K14 &#xB1;  or wild-type skin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> <italic>C</italic>). </p>

        <title>Generating K18 Transgenic Mice and Quantitating the  Level of Transgene Expression</title>
        <p>To test the functional significance of the multiplicity of  keratin sequences, we next focused our attention on replacing the major epidermal type I keratin K14 with the  major simple epithelial type I keratin K18. These keratins  share only 48% sequence identity at the amino acid level,  and are the most distantly related among the type I keratins. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> illustrates the K14 promoter&#x2013;K18 transgene  that was injected into fertilized mouse eggs to engineer  transgenic mice. In this case, we did not use any epitope  tags or manipulations of K18, which might complicate interpretation of the rescue. Mice that test positive by  Southern blot analysis for the K14 promoter&#x2013;driven K18  transgene were then bred to the F1 generation. </p>
        <p>We first demonstrated that the &#x3B1;K18 mAb used for our  studies did not cross-react with endogenous skin keratins.  As judged by indirect immunofluorescence of frozen tissue from normal mice, no &#x3B1;K18 staining was observed  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). In contrast to control skin, tissue from  several K18 transgenic mouse lines displayed strong staining with &#x3B1;K18, and this paralleled the staining pattern observed with &#x3B1;K14 (example shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>, respectively). Both &#x3B1;K18 and &#x3B1;K14 staining often extended  beyond the basal and into the suprabasal layers, reflective  of the ability of epidermal keratins to persist long after  their synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Fuchs and Green, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Roop et al., 1987</xref>).  Overall, these data demonstrated that K18 was faithfully  expressed in a pattern identical to that of K14.</p>
        <p>To examine the behavior of K18 protein in basal epidermal keratinocytes, we conducted two-dimensional gel  electrophoresis on keratins extracted from K18 transgenic  mouse skin. Coomassie blue staining revealed two to three  spots, not present in control skin samples, that migrated at  the molecular size (&#x223C;44 kD) and pKi (5.5) expected for  K18 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> <italic>A</italic>). The identity of these spots was confirmed  by &#x3B1;K18 immunoblot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> <italic>B</italic>). The size and pKi  of K18 in transgenic mouse epidermis was comparable to  that observed in simple epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Moll et al., 1982</xref>), suggesting that its expression in epidermis did not result in  any substantial processing or modifications of the protein. </p>
        <p>Heterozygous K18 positive mice were mated with K14  heterozygous mice, and eventually bred further to produce  K18 positive/K14 null animals. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> <italic>C</italic>, the  keratin extracts from the skins of these animals lacked the  K14 spots, but still contained K18 spots of approximately  the same isoelectric points, size, and levels as those seen in  the transgenic skin extracts.</p>
        <p>To assess the levels of K18 transgene expression relative  to endogenous K14, we had to modify the approach we  had used for the K16-14 protein (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> <italic>B</italic>), since K18  and K14 did not share a common antibody epitope. In the  first approach, we subjected the Coomassie-stained, two-dimensional gels of transgenic samples to densitometry  scanning, and compared directly the relative density of the  K18 versus K14 spots. Using this method, transgene expression ranged from 5% to 45% of the wild-type K14 levels depending upon the mouse. The example shown in Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> <italic>A</italic> is from the transgenic line used for this and subsequent studies, which on a background of two K14 alleles is  35% &#xB1; 5%. In the second approach, we used one dimensional PAGE of IF extracts from this line, followed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies against K18 and K14,  respectively. In this case, we used varying dilutions of purified recombinant human K18 and K14 as standards, so  that we could determine the approximate number of nanograms of K18 and K14 in the transgenic skin extracts (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic>). Two different anti-K18 antibodies, multiple  gels, and multiple exposures were used in the quantitation, which again provided an estimate that the sample  contained K18 at levels that were 35% &#xB1; 5% the levels  of K14.</p>
        <p>To further explore the K18 protein on a K14 null background, we conducted immunoblot analysis, this time using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis that enabled us to  examine and compare more samples. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>,  the immunoblot data verified the presence of K18 and the  absence of K14 in the skin of some offspring from heterozygous matings. Moreover, the K18 isolated from these  skins was found in the insoluble cytoskeletal fraction,  along with the other keratins, consistent with the notion  that it existed as part of the keratin network. The levels of  K18 were at least comparable to, if not higher than, those  in the K18 transgenic mice. </p>
        <p>Immunofluorescence of skin sections from the K18  transgenic/K14 null mice revealed a pattern of &#x3B1;K18 antibody staining that was similar to what we saw in the transgenic mouse skin; in this case, however, K14 was absent  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, respectively). This K18 was strictly due to  transgene expression and not to induction of endogenous  K18, since no &#x3B1;K18 staining was detected in K14 null skin  (not shown). The pattern of expression of K18 paralleled  that of K5, the normal partner of K14 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>).  The exchange that we genetically engineered between K18  and K14 did not result in the induction within the basal  layer of K6 and K16, the keratin pair known to be expressed normally in the outer root sheath of the hair follicle (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> <italic>E</italic>) and induced upon wound healing and a  variety of hyperproliferative disorders in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Sun et  al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Mansbridge and Knapp, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Paladini et al.,  1996</xref>). Thus, the genetic exchange appeared to occur in the  absence of other alterations in keratin expression. </p>

        <title>Expression of the K18 Transgene on a K14 Null  Background Restores Back Skin Morphology, but Not  Paw Blistering</title>
        <p>When bred on either a K14 wild-type background or a K14  +/&#x2212; heterozygous background, our K18 transgenic mice  appeared phenotypically and histologically indistinguishable from the wild type. These animals lived to adulthood,  showed no loss in viability, and developed no signs of aberrations in their skin or hair coat. This was important,  since there are a number of cases where ectopic expression  of a keratin can induce phenotypic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Powell and  Rogers, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Blessing et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Paladini and Coulombe, 1998</xref>).</p>
        <p>Even when bred to produce K18+/K14 null mice, certain features of the animals were typical of wild-type mice.  Most notably, the back skin morphology of K18+/K14 null  mice was similar to that of wild-type back skin, exhibiting  no signs of basal cell cytolysis or of alterations in terminal  differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> <italic>A</italic>). Within 2&#x2013;3 d after birth, however, the paws of these mice began to display signs of EBS,  including signs of basal cell degeneration within the cytoplasm of basal cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> <italic>B</italic>). In most regions of the ventral paw, basal epidermal cells showed gross signs of cytolysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> <italic>C</italic>), and often the basal layer was completely  degenerated, leading to detachment of the epidermis, and  only remnants of basal cells attached to the blister floor  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> <italic>D</italic>). Typical of EBS, suprabasal layers remained intact, reflective of expression of K1 and K10, concomitant  with downregulation of K5 and K14 in these layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Fuchs  and Green, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Roop et al., 1987</xref>). However, in both severely cytolyzed and in detached regions, the overall morphology of the epidermis was distorted, suggesting that  significant perturbations had occurred in the biochemistry  of these cells, presumably beginning before the time at  which they exited the basal layer. </p>
        <p>The phenotype of these mice was sufficiently severe that  they died within several days after birth unless given special care. While we did not analyze internal complications  in detail, the mice also suffered from degeneration of the  tongue and oral epithelia, places where the K14 promoter  is known to be active. Taken together, the expression of  K18 seemed to restore some, but clearly not all, of the defects caused by removal of K14 expression in mice.</p>

        <title>Restoration of the 10-nm Filament Network in Basal Cells of K18+/K14 Null Back Skin, but Not  Paw Skin</title>
        <p>To evaluate the effects of K18 expression on cytoskeletal  architecture, we first examined the basal keratinocytes in  the paw and back skin of K18 transgenic mice on a wild-type background. At the ultrastructural level, filament  bundles within K18 basal epidermal cells appeared indistinguishable from those in wild-type basal epidermal cells,  and no signs of keratin clumps or other perturbations were  detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> <italic>A</italic>). Desmosomes and hemidesmosomes  appeared normal, and both were surrounded by densely  staining keratin, as expected for the comparable wild-type  structures. Basal keratinocytes cultured from the skin of  K18 transgenic mice also displayed a seemingly normal  keratin network, which colabeled with antibodies against  K18, K5, and K14 (data not shown). Taken together, these  findings were in agreement with similar in vitro findings by  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Lu and Lane (1990)</xref>, who demonstrated that K18 is able to  integrate into an epidermal keratin network without perturbation. The result was also consistent with the normal  appearance of the K18 transgenic mice. </p>
        <p>We next examined the cytoskeletal architecture of the  skin of K18 positive/K14 null mice. A number of the back  skin basal cells of these mice displayed seemingly normal  cytoskeletal networks, with bundles of cytoplasmic keratin filaments connecting to hemidesmosomes and desmosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> <italic>B</italic>). This was in contrast to the back skin of  K14 null mice, but it was similar to that seen in the K16-14  rescue mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In these regions of the skin, no signs  of microblisters were detected, and the basal cells appeared generally healthy.</p>
        <p>Whereas the majority of back skin basal cells from K18  transgenic/K14 null mice appeared ultrastructurally normal, an occasional cell exhibited signs of degeneration  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> <italic>C</italic>, <italic>asterisk</italic>). Some vacuolization was also seen, a  feature also frequently found in Weber-Cockayne EBS,  the mildest form of human EBS (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Anton-Lamprecht, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Fuchs and Cleveland, 1998</xref>). A few bundles of keratin filaments were still detected in these cells,  but regions of the cytoplasm were devoid of such filaments  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> <italic>C</italic>, <italic>large arrowhead</italic>). In a few regions of the cytoplasm of these cells, a mixture of filaments and aggregates  of keratin-like material were detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> <italic>C&#x2032;</italic>). Clumps  of keratin were not seen in the K14 null skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Lloyd et al.,  1995</xref>), but are characteristic of dominant-negative acting  keratin mutants in mice and in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Vassar et al., 1991</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Anton-Lamprecht, 1994</xref>).</p>
        <p>Abnormalities in keratin networks were significantly  more prominent in the basal cells of the paw skin of K18  positive/K14 null mouse skin, i.e., in regions where overt  skin blistering was also readily detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> <italic>D</italic>). In  many of these cells, large areas of cytoplasm were devoid  of keratin, while other areas were densely packed with  clumps or aggregates of keratin-like material. These  clumps often associated with desmosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> <italic>D</italic>, <italic>inset</italic>),  and at higher magnification, they appeared as aggregates  of short filamentous-like structures (<italic>D&#x2032;</italic>). In Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> <italic>D&#x2033;</italic>, depicting the junction between a basal cell (<italic>BC</italic>) and a  spinous cell (<italic>SP</italic>), note that the spinous cells contained an  array of keratin filaments; this is again consistent with the  switch to expression of K1 and K10 in terminally differentiating layers.</p>
        <p>Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that the clumps  of material in the basal cells were keratin, and that they labeled not only with antibodies against K18, but also with  antibodies against K5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). Since these clumps were  not detected in K14 null mice, we conclude that the clumps  represent a new structure produced from a combination of  K18 and K5, or possibly other cytoplasmic proteins. </p>

        <title>The Keratin Network in K18 Replacement Skin Cannot  Withstand Mechanical Trauma</title>
        <p>A priori, the detection of keratin clumps in the K18 replacement skin could imply that the assembly process is  defective, or that there is an excess of K5 relative to K18.  Either case might result in the accumulation of partially  polymerized keratin material. Alternatively, it could be an  indication that the resulting keratin network formed by  K18/K5 filaments is unstable, and collapses partially upon  mechanical stress. To distinguish between these possibilities, we conducted an experiment to see how the basal epidermal layer would perform under mechanical stress.</p>
        <p>Four 2-d-old K14 null/K18+ replacement mice and two  control littermates were subjected to mild rubbing of the  back skin, which was then processed for ultrastructural  analysis immediately thereafer (within 10 min). In each  case, only the left side of the middle lower back was  rubbed (12 times with a cotton-tipped applicator); the  right side of each mouse was not rubbed, and was used as a  control for each mouse.</p>
        <p>Some basal epidermal cells of rubbed, K18 transgenic/ K14 null skin survived the rubbing, as judged by the presence of a seemingly normal keratin filament network and  generally healthy cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref> <italic>A</italic>). However, a number of cells displayed clumps or aggregates of keratin material (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref> <italic>B</italic>). The aberrancies in keratin networks  were similar, but more extensive than those seen in occasional back skin cells of unrubbed K18 replacement skin  and in many paw skin cells. As expected, we did not observe signs of cell cytolysis, a delayed response which in  human EBS occurs subsequent to alterations in cytoskeletal architecture (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Anton-Lamprecht, 1994</xref>). </p>
        <p>In contrast to the basal cells from rubbed back skin of  the K18+/K14 null mice, cells from similarly rubbed back  skin of control mice appeared uniformly healthy, with little or no perturbations in overall morphology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref> <italic>C</italic>).  Taken together, our findings suggest that the perturbations detected in basal cells of K18 replacement skin are  accentuated by mechanical stress.</p>

        <title>When Combined in the Presence of 6 M Urea, K5 and K18 Associate in a 1:1 Ratio to Form a  Complex That Then Assembles into Filaments  Efficiently In Vitro</title>
        <p>Our in vivo studies suggested that K5 and K18 can assemble into keratin filaments. To test this hypothesis in vitro  and analyze this interaction in more detail, we first demonstrated that K5 and K18 can form stable heterotypic complexes under 6 M urea buffer conditions. We showed this  by anion exchange chromatography (not shown) and by  chemical cross-linking (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref> <italic>A</italic>). Cross-linking using BS3  showed that the major K5-K18 and K5-K14 species  formed under these conditions was a 240-kD product, with  small amounts of an &#x223C;130-kD product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref> <italic>A</italic>). As  shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Coulombe and Fuchs, 1990</xref>), these species correspond to covalently cross-linked heterotetramers  and heterodimers of keratins, respectively. When the urea  concentration was raised to 8 M under otherwise identical  conditions, the K5-K18 tetramers were destabilized to a  greater extent than K5-K14 ones (data not shown). Taken  together, these data show that K18 can readily form heterotetramers in combination with K5, although these are  slightly less stable than those formed from K5-K14. </p>
        <p>When dialyzed under standard epidermal keratin assembly buffer, K5-K18 heterotypic complexes polymerized efficiently (90%) into 10-nm filaments that are similar  to those formed by K5-K14 (&gt;95% efficiency) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>,  compare <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>, respectively). Under in vitro assembly  conditions, it was not possible to distinguish reliably those  filaments formed from K5-K18 versus those formed from  K5-K14. Taken together with our in vivo data, these results provide further evidence that K18 is an effective partner for K5, and that the failure of K18 to fully rescue the  EBS phenotype resides in the physical properties of the  filament network, rather than in K18's ability to assemble  into a 10-nm filament network.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Previously, we showed that K14 null animals exhibit blistering upon physical stress, a feature that is due to mechanically induced degeneration in their epidermal basal  layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Lloyd et al., 1995</xref>). This study provided compelling  evidence that the epidermal keratin network functions to  impart mechanical integrity to keratinocytes. Stress-induced  blistering of the basal epidermal layer is the hallmark of  EBS in humans, and it is known that genetic alterations in  the K5 and K14 network are responsible for this disorder  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bonifas et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Coulombe et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Lane et al.,  1992</xref>). Although human EBS typically involves keratin filament&#x2013;disrupting mutations in the K5 or K14 genes and is  inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, rare cases of  recessive homozygous mutations have been described that  show a dramatic reduction in keratin filaments within the  basal layer of the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Chan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Rugg et al.,  1994</xref>). True K14 null mutations have been engineered in  mice, and these mice exhibit an EBS phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Lloyd et  al., 1995</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our previous studies on K14 null mice demonstrated  that in the absence of K14, there is no dramatic upregulation of other type I keratins to provide compensation for  the loss of this keratin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Lloyd et al., 1995</xref>). In the absence  of a partner, the basal type II keratin K5 was still present,  but unable to form a keratin filament network. This was  consistent with predictions made from in vitro filament assembly studies arguing that K5 and K14 form obligatory  heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Coulombe and Fuchs, 1990</xref>; see also  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Hatzfeld and Weber, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Steinert, 1990</xref>). In the absence  of K14, there is a very sparse keratin filament network  made in the basal layer, resulting from the presence of  very low levels of K15 in postnatal mouse skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Lloyd et  al., 1995</xref>). However, this sparse network was not able to  sustain the mechanical stress normally handled by the  more robust bundles of K5-K14 filaments.</p>
      <p>To test the possibility that a non-epidermal type I keratin might be able to restore mechanical stability to the  basal epidermal keratin network, we chose K18 as our replacement for K14. Indeed, K8/K18 are the major keratins  of simple epithelial tissues just as K5 and K14 are the key  keratins of stratified epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Moll et al., 1982</xref>). Moreover, in contrast to most keratins, these two keratin pairs  are often expressed in the absence of any other keratins,  establishing that in their respective tissue, they can on  their own form extensive keratin networks. Since the dividing populations of simple epithelia and epidermis are  so dramatically different in their morphology and in their  physical properties, we felt that this replacement would  provide a major test of whether there are fundamental differences in the two respective keratin networks.</p>
      <p>On a wild-type background, our K18 transgenic mice  displayed no overt phenotype and showed no loss of viability with age. This was also true for K18 transgenic mice  on a heterozygous K14 background, where the levels of  K18 approached those of K14. We have cultured the transgenic basal epidermal cells, and they too behaved normally and exhibited a normal keratin network that labeled  with antibodies against endogenous basal keratins or K18  (Hutton, E., and E. Fuchs, unpublished observations).  Thus, both in vivo and in vitro, K18 seemed to integrate  into the endogenous K5-K14 keratin network without any  noticeable perturbations. Moreover, in vivo, a basal keratin network composed of K5, K14, and K18 seemed able to  withstand the natural environmental stresses in a fashion  analogous to the K14-K5 network. This was the case irrespective of whether the mice contained one or two of their  K14 alleles.</p>
      <p>Overall, the behavior of the transgenic K18 mice  seemed to be markedly different from that of transgenic  K16 mice generated using the same K14 basal epidermal  promoter: in that case, expression of K16 at &gt;60% the levels of endogenous K14 resulted in skin that was hyperkeratotic, scaly and devoid of fur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Paladini and Coulombe,  1998</xref>). It could be that the differences in K18 versus K16  transgenic phenotypes stem from the higher level of expression (or increased stability) of K16 than K18. However, it seems more likely that these differences stem from  inherent differences in keratins, particularly since the K16-14 hybrid protein behaved normally when expressed in  mice at comparable levels to K16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Paladini and Coulombe,  1998</xref>). Taken together, even at the transgenic level, there  appear to be differences in the behavior of type I keratins  expressed under the control of a basal epidermal keratin  promoter.</p>
      <p>Even on a K14 null background, transgenic K18 still  functioned quite well in back skin, where it coassembled  with K5 to form a network of keratin filaments in the basal  epidermal layer. That K5 and K18 can form bona fide 10-nm filaments in the absence of K14 was also confirmed  from our in vitro studies. These in vitro&#x2013;assembled K18/ K5 filaments were similar in structure, appearance, and  concentration to the epidermal counterparts. Taken together, these findings indicate that K18 is a suitable partner for K5 in keratin filament assembly.</p>
      <p>The keratin filaments formed by K5 and K18 in vivo associated both with hemidesmosomes and with desmosomes in the basal epidermal layer. While the molecular  details of the interaction between hemidesmosomes and  IFs have not been fully elucidated, in vitro studies suggest  that the interaction between desmosomes and keratin filaments occurs through binding of the desmoplakin tail segment to the head domain of type II epidermal keratins  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Kouklis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Kowalczyk et al., 1997</xref>). In the K18  positive/K14 null mice, the K5 head domain is presumably  still available to associate with desmoplakin, and this could  explain why we did not observe any perturbation in keratin filament attachments to cell junctions. Interestingly,  the interaction between K8 and desmoplakin seems to be  much weaker than that with K5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Kouklis et al., 1994</xref>),  leading us to wonder whether desmosomal interactions  might have been compromised if we had exchanged the  type II rather than the type I keratins. The answer to this  question must await further replacement studies.</p>
      <p>Despite the ability of K5 and K18 to assemble into filaments and to make a keratin filament network in basal  epidermal cells, K18 did not fully compensate for the loss  of K14, even at the highest levels that we were able to  achieve in the present study. These mice still died within  several days after birth, presumably because of both internal and external complications (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Lloyd et al., 1995</xref> for a  description of internal abnormalities in the K14 null mice).  Within the skin, the severity in blistering and perturbations in the keratin network seemed to correlate with degree of mechanical stress, as judged by the fact that the pathology was most prominent in paw skin, a region of  natural stress, and it was exacerbated in response to physical rubbing of back skin. Taken together, these observations suggest a model whereby the K18/K5 network assembles, but is unable to withstand mechanical stress,  leading to a collapse of the network and skin blistering. In  the future, cytoskeletal tension measurements might be  used to address this hypothesis directly.</p>
      <p>The current limitations of keratinocyte promoter activity and/or K18 turnover rates precluded our examining the  consequences of expressing higher levels of K18, and thus  we cannot say whether comparable to wild-type K14 levels  of K18 might better compensate for the loss of K14 in our  mice. This said, mice and humans harboring only a single  functional K14 allele behave normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Chan et al., 1994</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Rugg et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Lloyd et al., 1995</xref>), and in the present  study, K14 null mice expressing the K16-14 transgene survived to adulthood and showed no overt signs of skin blistering. Thus, while gross differences in filament density  can certainly influence basal epidermal cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Chan  et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Rugg et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Lloyd et al., 1995</xref>), more subtle differences in filament density may be less important  than the particular keratins involved in conferring mechanical integrity to a tissue.</p>
      <p>Our data lend support to the notion that the specific  keratins composing an IF network in vivo are central to  cytoskeletal architecture and design in cells (for recent related papers on this subject, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Paladini et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Paladini and Coulombe, 1998</xref>). Before our study, a number of  differences had already been recognized between K8/K18  and K5/K14. For instance, the physical properties of K8/ K18 heterodimers and filaments assembled from them differ markedly from K5/K14 heterodimers and their corresponding filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Franke et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Hatzfeld and  Franke, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Coulombe and Fuchs, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Hatzfeld and  Weber, 1990</xref>; Hoffmann and Franke, 1997). Moreover, in  vivo, K8/K18 networks can reorganize during mitosis in  some cells, whereas K5/K14 networks do not, suggesting  the possibility that K8/K18 networks may be more dynamic than K5/K14 networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Franke et al., 1983</xref>). Dramatic sequence and size differences in the head and tail  segments and in the posttranslational modifications of keratins are likely to account for at least a part of these dramatic variations in keratin networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Lu and Lane, 1990</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Liao et al., 1995</xref> and references therein; for review see  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Fuchs and Weber, 1994</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that  K18 cannot fully compensate for K14 because it creates a  more dynamic keratin network that is not entirely compatible with the structural requirements imposed upon a tissue like the epidermis.</p>
      <p>The seemingly less stable aspects of the K5/K18 network  could also have arisen from genetically forcing an undesirable partner upon K5. That keratins have distinct preferences for their partners has been recently inferred from  K18 knockout studies, where when left without its normal  partner, K8 can successfully compete for K19, normally  the partner of K7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Magin et al., 1998</xref>). To assess whether  K8/K18 can replace K5/K14 must await further replacement studies.</p>
      <p>In summary, our study suggests that the multiplicity of  keratin sequences is not simply an evolutionary quirk, but  that these proteins have diverged to perform specific functions in higher eukaryotic epithelia. Whereas keratin networks are a universal feature of epithelia, their density,  composition, and organization vary dramatically and seem  to be tailored to the varied shapes and structural requirements of individual epithelial cells.</p>
