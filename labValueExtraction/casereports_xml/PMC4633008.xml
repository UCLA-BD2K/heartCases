  <body>
    <p>JAP, a 79-year-old male and retired metalworker, born in V&#xE1;rzea Alegre
(Cear&#xE1;, Brazil) and residing in S&#xE3;o Paulo was admitted to the hospital in
October 2013 due to decompensated heart failure.</p>
    <p>The patient was referred 1 year before to InCor with a history of progressive dyspnea
triggered by less than ordinary activities, lower-extremity edema, and abdominal
enlargement. He sought medical care due to the abdominal enlargement, which was diagnosed
as an ascites. He denied chest pain, hospitalization due to myocardial infarction or
stroke, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes.</p>
    <p>The patient was a previous smoker and had stopped smoking at the age of 37 years. He was
also an alcoholic and reported drinking alcohol for the last time 1 year before.</p>
    <p>He was referred to InCor for treatment of heart failure.</p>
    <p>An echocardiogram revealed an increased thickness in the septum (17 mm) and free left
ventricular wall (15 mm), and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 26%.</p>
    <p>The patient reported daily use of enalapril 10 mg, spironolactone 25 mg, furosemide 80 mg,
omeprazole 40 mg, and ferrous sulfate (40 mg Fe) three tablets.</p>
    <p>On March 12, 2013, his physical examination showed a weight of 55 kg, height of 1.75 m,
body mass index (BMI) of 18&#xA0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of
90&#xA0;X&#xA0;50 mm Hg, and the presence of a hepatojugular reflux. There were no signs of jugular
venous hypertension, and the pulmonary and cardiac auscultations were normal. He had
ascites, and his liver was palpable 5 cm below the right costal margin. Peripheral pulses
were palpable, and a ++/4+ edema was observed.</p>
    <p>An ECG (February 23, 2012) had shown a sinus rhythm, heart rate of 52 bpm, PR interval of
192 ms, QRS duration of 106 ms, indirect signs of right atrial overload (wide variability
in QRS amplitude between V1 and V2), and left atrial overload (prolonged and notched P
waves), low QRS voltage in the frontal plane with an indeterminate axis, an electrically
inactive area in the anteroseptal region and secondary changes in ventricular
repolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

was 1.007, pH 5.5, the sediment was normal, and there were no abnormal elements.</p>
    <p>A new echocardiographic assessment on April 20, 2012, had shown an aortic diameter of 32
mm, left atrium of 52&#xA0;mm, septal and posterior left ventricular wall thickness of 15 mm,
diastolic/systolic left ventricular diameters of 46/40&#xA0;mm, and left ventricular ejection
fraction of 28%. Both ventricles had diffuse and marked hypokinesia. The valves were normal

    <p>A 24-hour electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring on April 19, 2012, showed a baseline
sinus rhythm with a lowest rate of 46 bpm and greatest rate of 97 bpm; 48&#xA0;isolated,
polymorphic, and paired ventricular extrasystoles; 137&#xA0;atrial extrasystoles; and an episode
of atrial tachycardia over three beats with a frequency of 98 bpm. There were no
atrioventricular or intraventricular blocks interfering with the conduction of the
stimulus.</p>
    <p>The patient was transferred from the pacemaker clinic to the general cardiopathy
clinic.</p>
    <p>During a clinic appointment on January 22, 2013, the patient was asymptomatic and reported
the use of enalapril 10&#xA0;mg, spironolactone 25 mg, furosemide 60 mg, and carvedilol 12.5 mg.
His physical examination was normal.</p>
    <p>The main diagnostic hypotheses were hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathy.</p>
    <p>A testicular ultrasound (September 09, 2013) was normal, except for cystic formations in
the right inguinal canal. An abdominal ultrasonography (September 10, 2013) showed
substantial ascites and hepatic cysts with internal septations, and no signs of portal
hypertension.</p>
    <p>After presenting an increase in dyspnea with the development of paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, worsening ascites and lower-extremity edema, and paresthesia on hands and feet,
the patient was admitted to the hospital.</p>
    <p>On physical examination (October 19, 2013) he was oriented and eupneic, with a heart rate
of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 80 X 60 mmHg, a normal pulmonary auscultation, cardiac
auscultation with arrhythmia and no murmurs, substantial ascites, and edema and hyperemia
of the lower extremities.</p>
    <p>A chest x-ray (October 21, 2013) showed cardiomegaly and interstitial lung infiltrates; the

    <p>During a new paracentesis (November 11, 2013), the aspirated fluid was bloody, and the
patient presented hypotension and decreased consciousness, progressing to cardiac arrest
with pulseless electrical activity, which was reverted. This was followed by ventricular
tachycardia, cardioverted with 200 J.</p>
    <p>New tests (November 11, 2013 - morning) showed the following results: hemoglobin 11.9&#xA0;g/dL,
hematocrit 36%, leukocytes 7,780/mm<sup>3</sup> (neutrophils 83%, eosinophils 2%,
lymphocytes 9%, and monocytes 6%), platelets 188,000 /mm<sup>3</sup>, urea 301&#xA0;mg/dL,
creatinine 4.14&#xA0;mg/dL, sodium 125&#xA0;mEq/L, potassium 4.4 mEq/L, CRP 97.06 mg/L. On venous
blood gas analysis, pH was 7.33, bicarbonate 19.9&#xA0;mmol/L, and base excess (-) 5.4 mmol/L.
Additional tests performed on the same day (November 11, 2013 &#x2013; 5:44 pm) showed hemoglobin
of 6.3&#xA0;g/dL, sodium of 123&#xA0;mEq/L, potassium of 5.4&#xA0;mEq/L, venous lactate of 93&#xA0;mg/dL, PT
(INR) of 3.2 and aPTT (rel) of 1.98.</p>
    <p>Later during the day, the patient progressed with shock refractory to high doses of
dobutamine (20 &#xB5;g/kg/min ) and norepinephrine (1.2 &#xB5;g/kg/min), followed by
cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity that recovered but was followed by a new
irreversible cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity during intra-aortic balloon
placement (November 11, 2013 &#x2013; 6:30 pm).</p>

      <title>Clinical Aspects</title>
      <p>The patient JAB, a 79-year-old previous smoker and alcoholic man residing in S&#xE3;o
Paulo, attended an outpatient clinic at InCor due to heart failure which worsened
progressively since 2012, requiring hospitalization for treatment.</p>
      <p>Heart failure is a systemic and complex clinical syndrome, defined as a cardiac
dysfunction that causes the blood supply to be insufficient to meet tissular metabolic
demands, in the presence of a normal venous return, or which only meets the demands with
high filling pressure<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Prevalence studies estimate that 23 million individuals worldwide have heart failure and
that 2 million new cases are diagnosed annually. According to DATASUS information,
Brazil has about 2 million individuals with heart failure and 240,000 new cases
diagnosed annually<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The main causes of heart failure are hypertension, coronary artery disease, Chagas
disease, cardiomyopathies, endocrinopathies, toxins, and drugs, among others<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The cardinal manifestations of heart
failure are dyspnea and fatigue, and may include exercise intolerance, fluid retention,
and pulmonary and systemic congestion<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. The patient in this case presented with progressive dyspnea triggered
by less than ordinary activities, lower-extremity edema, and ascites, which
characterized him as class III according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA)
classification.</p>
      <p>On complementary tests, the echocardiogram showed marked left ventricular hypertrophy
with some degree of asymmetry, and reduced ejection fraction. Cardiac hypertrophy is
often associated with hypertension or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but both present with
normal or increased ECG voltage. Therefore, the findings of ventricular hypertrophy
associated with decreased ECG voltage in the absence of pericardial effusion are
exclusive of infiltrative cardiomyopathies, a group of cardiac disorders within the
restrictive cardiomyopathies<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Restrictive cardiomyopathy may occur with a wide variety of systemic diseases. Some
restrictive cardiomyopathies are rare in clinical practice and may present initially
with heart failure. This type of cardiomyopathy is characterized by filling restriction,
with reduced diastolic volume in one or both ventricles, normal or close to normal
systolic function, and ventricular wall thickening. It may be idiopathic or associated
with other diseases, such as amyloidosis, endomyocardial disease with or without
eosinophilia, sarcoidosis, and hemochromatosis, among others<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. In this case, the presence of amyloid deposits in the
cheek mucosa biopsy indicated a diagnosis of amyloidosis, and the increase in serum
beta-2 microglobulin reflected a worse prognosis<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Amyloidosis is characterized by deposits of amyloid protein in different organs and
tissues. These deposits may be responsible for different types of clinical presentation,
with a spectrum that ranges from lack of symptoms to sequential organic dysfunction
culminating with death<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Cardiac amyloidosis is caused by amyloid deposits around cardiac fibers, and can be
identified by a left ventricular wall thickening exceeding 12 mm in the absence of
hypertension with at least one of the following characteristics: conduction disorder and
low voltage complexes on the ECG, restrictive cardiomyopathy, low cardiac output,
isolate atrial involvement (as commonly seen in elderly individuals) or diffuse
involvement affecting the ventricles. In the latter situation, it can cause heart
failure with a poor prognosis<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Our patient, who was not hypertensive, presented low voltage complexes on the ECG, which
were more prominent in the frontal plane, an electrically inactive area in the
anteroseptal region, and diffuse changes in ventricular repolarization. This pattern can
be found in some diseases in addition to infiltrative cardiomyopathies, such as
decompensated hypothyroidism, pericardial effusion, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, and obesity. Other electrocardiographic information, such as the pattern of
infarction, can be found with or without obstructive coronary atherosclerotic disease by
deposition of substances in the microcirculation and small intramyocardial
arteries<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Amyloidosis may be classified as primary, secondary, or hereditary. Primary amyloidosis,
in which AL is the primarily involved protein, may be further subdivided into idiopathic
(localized forms) or associated with multiple myeloma or other plasma cell dyscrasias
(systemic forms)<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Multiple myeloma is a neoplastic disorder of plasma cells that affects individuals with
an average age of 70 years at diagnosis. Some characteristics of the patient in this
case could suggest multiple myeloma: age, male gender, renal failure, and cylindruria.
However, other important clinical parameters were absent, such as hypercalcemia, anemia,
and bone disease. Also, the Bence-Jones protein, which is present in up to 75% of the
cases, was not detected on urinary electrophoresis<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The secondary type of amyloidosis results from deposits of AA protein and frequently
arises as a complication of infectious or inflammatory processes, such as rheumatoid
arthritis (the most common cause), tuberculosis, systemic lupus erythematosus,
inflammatory bowel disease, syphilis, or even neoplastic diseases. Pro-inflammatory
cytokines, which are present in these disorders, stimulate the hepatic production of
serum A amyloid<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Finally, the hereditary type of the disease has an autosomal dominant transmission and
may involve several types of amyloid proteins, such as the AA protein in some groups of
patients with familial Mediterranean fever, and the ATTR protein (derived from the
transthyretin or prealbumin) in familial amyloid polyneuropathy<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>As for the treatment, measures to control symptoms related to diastolic heart failure,
such as volume control, should be implemented. Diuretics and vasodilators should be
administered with caution since the cardiac output in these patients is greatly
dependent on increased venous pressures. Specific treatment should be directed to the
etiology of the amyloidosis<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>After an evaluation in the clinic on January, 2013, the patient received medications
that are proven to modify the rates of hospitalization and mortality in heart failure
with reduced ejection fraction (beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,
aldosterone antagonist), and symptom-relieving agents (diuretics)<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. The patient was receiving enalapril 10
mg, spironolactone 25 mg, furosemide 60 mg, and carvedilol 12.5 mg.</p>
      <p>After 8 months, due to the decompensated heart failure and hypotension, the patient
returned to the emergency room and required hospitalization. The use of conventional
therapy for heart failure often worsens the progression of amyloidosis. Therefore,
cardiac amyloidosis should be suspected when the patient&#x2019;s clinical condition worsens in
response to conventional treatment, particularly in individuals older than 50 years. The
therapy is exclusively symptomatic and should not include digitalis, beta-blockers,
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or calcium channel antagonists, since some
studies have shown an increased sensitivity to these drugs which can lead to hypotension
and intensification of conduction disorders<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the decompensation of the patient&#x2019;s heart failure with deterioration of the
ascites culminated in two paracenteses, with the last paracentesis probably accompanied
by a puncture accident due to the appearance of bloody fluid, decrease in red blood
count, and hypovolemic shock associated with cardiogenic shock, culminating in a mixed
refractory shock and cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity <bold>(Dr. Sumaia
Mustafa, Dr. Alice Tatsuko Yamada).</bold></p>

        <p>The heart weighed 680 g and was increased in volume due to moderate cavity dilation
and wall thickening in all four chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f07">Figure

atria, in particular, was finely granular and brown-yellowish in appearance. There
were no significant changes in the valves, and the coronary arteries were armed
without significant obstruction of their lumen.</p>

        <p>Mass spectrometry gathers all qualities to establish an unequivocal diagnosis of
amyloidosis since it has a high sensitivity and ability to identify the proteins
through sequencing<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, we

the sample.</p>
        <p>Sections of heart tissue containing amyloid deposits (confirmed by staining with
Congo red) fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin were dissected and the proteins
were then extracted with Liquid Tissue&#xAE; MS Protein Prep Kit (Expression
Pathology) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After digestion with trypsin,
the resulting peptides were analyzed by high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry using the mass spectrometer Q-Exactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The
acquisitions of spectral data were carried out using the DDA (date dependent
analysis) mode with a selection of the 10 most abundant ions for sequencing by HCD
(Higher-energy collisional dissociation). The data were processed with the software
MaxQuant. The proteomic analysis was performed in triplicate.</p>
        <p>The processed data generated lists of proteins representing the protein content of
the sample. In total, 25 possible amyloid proteins were investigated in these lists
in order to determine the identity of the deposited substance. There were 15 peptides
belonging to transthyretin that together covered 76.2% of the full sequence of the
protein.</p>
        <p>To confirm the result, we also evaluated the abundance of different peptides present
in the sample. Among the 25 most abundant peptides, three belonged to transthyretin
(ALGISPFHEHAEVVFTANDSGPR, TSESGELHGLTTEEEFVEGIYK, and GSPAINVAVHVFR). The others were
assigned to actin, myosin, desmin, and myoglobin, confirming the identity of the
amyloid protein <bold>(Dr. Fabio Mitsuo Lima and Dr. Valdemir Melechco Carvalho-

        <title>Comments:</title>
        <p>This case demonstrates how important it is in amyloidosis to investigate the
deposited substance. Amyloidosis is a generic name to describe a group of diseases
characterized by extracellular deposits of different substances in different organs.
These substances are fibrillar proteins that become insoluble with changes in their
spatial conformation. More than 20 types of proteins have been described in these
deposits<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. From an
anatomopathological perspective, the deposits can be characterized by
immunohistochemical reactions, but with some restrictions as described below. The
cardiovascular system is most often affected by the AL protein (deposits of
light-chain immunoglobulin), senile, and familial forms<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p>The pathologist may identify neoplastic proliferation of plasmocytes producing the
deposited immunoglobulins by bone marrow examination labeled for these cells. In
tissue preparations, the pathologist may demonstrate by immunohistochemistry if the
deposited substance is one of these immunoglobulins. Some authors recommend a biopsy
of other organs before the endomyocardial biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and
identify the type of amyloid<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. In
this case, immunohistochemical labeling was not helpful in establishing the
diagnosis, because it was inconclusive to the type of protein deposited.</p>
        <p>Although there are reports in the literature of identification of transthyretin in
tissues by immunohistochemical reactions, this was not possible in this case.
However, with mass spectrometry analysis, we identified that the deposited protein
was transthyretin, which is usually present in senile and familial forms of
amyloidosis. In this patient, the familial form was less likely due to the exclusive
involvement of heart and blood vessels. However, only a genetic research and
evaluation of other members of the family could exclude it completely.</p>
        <p>Another point that deserves discussion in this case is the laboratory report of high
levels of immunoglobulin E. We could assume that this referred to the deposited
protein, but the diagnostic methods performed to complement the autopsy revealed that
this was not the case.</p>
