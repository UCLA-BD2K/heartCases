      <abstract>
        <p>Dysregulated endoplasmic reticulum stress and phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2&#x3B1; (eIF2&#x3B1;) are associated with pancreatic &#x3B2;-cell failure and diabetes. Here, we report the first homozygous mutation in the <italic>PPP1R15B</italic> gene (also known as constitutive repressor of eIF2&#x3B1; phosphorylation [CReP]) encoding the regulatory subunit of an eIF2&#x3B1;-specific phosphatase in two siblings affected by a novel syndrome of diabetes of youth with short stature, intellectual disability, and microcephaly. The R658C mutation in PPP1R15B affects a conserved amino acid within the domain important for protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) binding. The R658C mutation decreases PP1 binding and eIF2&#x3B1; dephosphorylation and results in &#x3B2;-cell apoptosis. Our findings support the concept that dysregulated eIF2&#x3B1; phosphorylation, whether decreased by mutation of the kinase (<italic>EIF2AK3</italic>) in Wolcott-Rallison syndrome or increased by mutation of the phosphatase (<italic>PPP1R15B</italic>), is deleterious to &#x3B2;-cells and other secretory tissues, resulting in diabetes associated with multisystem abnormalities.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The molecular mechanisms contributing to pancreatic &#x3B2;-cell dysfunction and apoptosis in diabetes remain poorly understood. Accumulating evidence suggests that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and aspects of the response to it contribute to &#x3B2;-cell failure both in type 1 and type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). ER stress is defined as an imbalance between unfolded protein load in the ER and the organelle&#x2019;s functional capacity. This activates an ER stress response, also known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), which reduces protein load and increases ER folding capacity. The UPR is an adaptive response, particularly important for the survival of cells with a high secretory capacity such as pancreatic &#x3B2;-cells. The UPR is triggered by the activation of ER transmembrane proteins that sense the misfolded protein accumulation in the ER lumen and transduce the signal to the cytoplasm. One of the canonical ER stress transducers is protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK, encoded by <italic>EIF2AK3</italic>). PERK phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2&#x3B1; (eIF2&#x3B1;) and attenuates protein translation to lessen the burden of the stressed ER (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The effector pathway downstream of PERK is tightly regulated by eIF2&#x3B1; dephosphorylation carried out by a holophosphatase complex consisting of a common catalytic subunit, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), and a substrate-specific regulatory subunit, PPP1R15. Two such regulatory subunits are known: the constitutive repressor of eIF2&#x3B1; phosphorylation (CReP), encoded by <italic>PPP1R15B</italic>, acts under basal conditions (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), while GADD34, encoded by <italic>PPP1R15A</italic>, is activated by eIF2&#x3B1; phosphorylation and feeds back negatively on PERK signaling to promote the recovery of protein synthesis as the stress response wanes (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The PERK pathway and its regulation are especially important for pancreatic &#x3B2;-cell function and survival (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Homozygous mutations in <italic>EIF2AK3</italic> cause Wolcott-Rallison syndrome, a syndromic form of neonatal diabetes with epiphyseal dysplasia, growth retardation, and variable other manifestations including microcephaly (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)&#x2014;features mirrored in Perk knockout mice (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Unmitigated ER stress contributes to &#x3B2;-cell demise in several other monogenic forms of diabetes. Mutations in the insulin gene that disrupt proinsulin folding cause severe &#x3B2;-cell ER stress and neonatal diabetes (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The loss of the ER cochaperone p58<sup>IPK</sup>, due to <italic>DNAJC3</italic> mutations, leads to a syndrome with young-onset diabetes (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here, we report on a <italic>PPP1R15B</italic> mutation in two siblings with young-onset diabetes, microcephaly, and short stature. The mutation, located in the PP1 binding domain (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), disrupts PP1 binding and eIF2&#x3B1; dephosphorylation and reveals that &#x3B2;-cell dysfunction and apoptosis may be caused both by too little and by too much eIF2&#x3B1; phosphorylation.</p>

        <title>Patients</title>
        <p>We studied a consanguineous family of Algerian origin, with two siblings affected by young-onset diabetes that is associated with short stature, microcephaly, and intellectual disability. The study was explained to the patients, their parents, tutors, and other family members, who agreed to participate in the genetic study and signed informed consents. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee. Blood samples were obtained from the two affected siblings and two nonaffected relatives (the paternal grandmother and a paternal aunt) and DNA was extracted using standard procedures.</p>

Exons of genomic DNA of the index case (patient 1) were captured with in-solution enrichment methodology (SureSelect Human All Exon Kits, version 2; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with the company&#x2019;s biotinylated oligonucleotide probe library (Human All Exon, version 2, 50 Mb; Agilent). Genomic DNA was then sequenced on a sequencer as paired-end 75 bases (Illumina HiSeq 2000; Illumina, San Diego, CA). Image analysis and base calling were performed with Real-Time Analysis software, version 1.14 with default parameters (Illumina). Bioinformatic analysis was performed by an in-house pipeline (IntegraGen) based on the Consensus Assessment of Sequence and Variation (CASAVA 1.8; Illumina) to perform alignment against human reference genome (GRCh37/hg19), variant calling, and coverage analysis. The overall sequencing coverage over the whole exome was 88% and 79% for a 10&#xD7; and 25&#xD7; depth of coverage, respectively, resulting in a mean sequencing depth of 64&#xD7; per base. Exome variant analysis was then performed using an in-house python pipeline on genetic variation annotation results (M.D., A.P., and C.J., unpublished data). Variants were filtered consecutively based on their quality, their genotype (homozygous status), and the predicted consequence on coding capacity (missense, nonsense, splice-site, and coding insertion/deletion&#x2014;inframe or frameshift) and for their rare status based on information available in in-house (control subjects, IntegraGen) and public databases (Exome Variant Server [EVS], ESP6500SI; Exome Aggregation Consortium [ExAC], release 0.3; and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database [dbSNP], version 138). Variants that were homozygous or had a minor allele frequency &gt;0.005 in any in-house or public database were excluded.</p>

        <title>Variant Confirmation and Test for Diabetes Segregation in the Family</title>
        <p>Each rare variant identified as homozygous in patient 1 by exome sequencing was confirmed in patient 1 and further genotyped in patient 2, in two nonaffected relatives (a paternal grandmother and a paternal aunt), and in an unrelated healthy control subject. This was done by Sanger sequencing or by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) genotyping using specific amplification primers and restriction enzymes that differentiate the two alleles, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis using standard techniques. Sequencing primers and PCR-RFLP primers/enzymes are available on request.</p>

        <title>Description of a Novel Diabetes Syndrome With Young-Onset Diabetes, Short Stature, and Microcephaly</title>
        <p>We studied two siblings with young-onset diabetes, intellectual disability, microcephaly, and short stature who were born to first-cousin consanguineous parents without diabetes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> for the description of the patients). The index case (patient 1), a boy, was diagnosed with diabetes at age 15 years, with acute onset of polyuria and polydipsia. Fasting glucose was 13.4 mmol/L and HbA<sub>1c</sub> was 13.0% (119 mmol/mol). Type 1 diabetes&#x2013;specific autoantibodies (islet cell antibody, GAD, IA2 antibodies) were negative. Fasting C-peptide was low but within normal range for normoglycemic subjects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), showing that at least some residual &#x3B2;-cell mass remained. He was treated with twice-daily insulin injections. Diabetes was initially well controlled with relatively low doses of insulin (&#x223C;0.5 units/kg/day) but evolved to significant glucose variability with severe hypoglycemia episodes and seizures. He had growth retardation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>), reaching an adult height of 155 cm, with normal growth hormone (peak at 41 ng/mL after ornithine stimulation test; normal reference values [N] &gt;10) and IGF1 levels (291 &#x3BC;g/L; N = 249&#x2013;672). Thyroxine (18 pmol/L; N = 10&#x2013;23) and glucagon (116 ng/L; N = 25&#x2013;250) levels were normal. Blood cell count, electrolytes, creatinine, liver enzymes, bilirubin, cholesterol, triglycerides, lactate, and pyruvate levels were normal. He had delayed puberty, with an undescended right testis that was surgically corrected. No anomaly of the gonadal function was found, with normal levels of testosterone (9.54 nmol/L; N = 9.0&#x2013;26.0), luteinizing hormone (4.4 mU/mL; N = 0.24&#x2013;5.9), and follicle-stimulating hormone (6.5 mU/mL; N = 1.9&#x2013;11.6). He had microcephaly (adult cranial perimeter: 46 cm, &#x2212;4.0 SD) and severe intellectual disability, with a quiet introverted character. At 15 years of age, his mental level was comparable to that of a 5- to 6-year-old child. He answered questions using simple sentences but could not read or write. His vocabulary was limited to 200&#x2013;300 words and he did not engage in conversation. He was able to perform tasks such as feeding, dressing, and bathing but required full assistance in daily life. MRI showed rarefaction of the white matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>), with a nonspecific slightly elevated level of protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (albumin and IgG). He had neurogenic deafness (hearing loss of 39%). He also had kyphoscoliosis, pectus excavatum, mild abnormalities of vertebral bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>), fine fingers and toes, oligodontia and dental hypoplasia, sparse hair, and a high-pitched voice. Eye fundus was normal. Clinical and biochemical examination at 28 years of age showed that his diabetes was relatively well controlled (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Glucagon-stimulated C-peptide was detectable. Pubertal development was fully achieved (Tanner stage 5) with adult genitalia and complete epiphyseal closure on bone age X-ray. Biochemical measurements in serum showed low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (55 nmol/L; N = 75&#x2013;340), but normal levels of calcium, IGF-1, and thyroxine. Markers of phosphate metabolism were normal: parathyroid hormone (19 pg/mL; N = 10&#x2013;55), serum phosphate (1.54 mmol/L; N = 1.30&#x2013;1.85), and alkaline phosphatase (320 units/L; N = 210&#x2013;830). Urinary calcium-to-creatinine ratio was also normal (0.33; N &lt;0.7). His weight and BMI were low at 44.3 kg and 18.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry showed normal body composition and bone mineral content. Overall, these results are in keeping with bone dysplasia without marked disturbance of calcium metabolism, with severe growth retardation unrelated to pituitary or thyroid dysfunction. Serum amylase, blood cell count, liver and kidney function, and iron metabolism were normal. On ultrasound, liver and pancreas were normal, while the kidneys were small, with mild dilation of right calyces.</p>

        <title>Identification of a Homozygous Mutation in the <italic>PPP1R15B</italic> Gene in the Two Siblings With Diabetes</title>
        <p>Because of the familial context, we hypothesized that the syndrome was caused by an autosomal recessive mutation. To test this hypothesis, we performed exome sequencing on patient 1&#x2019;s genomic DNA and identified 18 rare homozygous autosomal variants after filtering (coding variants, minor allele frequency &lt;0.005, and absence of subjects homozygous for the rare variant in public and in-house databases; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db15-0477/-/DC1">Supplementary Tables 4 and 5</ext-link>). We confirmed these variants in patient 1 and genotyped them in patient 2 and in two nonaffected relatives (a grandmother and an aunt) by Sanger sequencing or PCR-RFLP genotyping. This reduced the number of variants to 6, for which both siblings, but not the unaffected relatives, were homozygous for the rare allele: <italic>ADAMTSL4, FLG, KIF21B, PPP1R15B</italic>, and <italic>SLC45A3</italic>, located on chromosome 1, and <italic>UNC80,</italic> located on chromosome 2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db15-0477/-/DC1">Supplementary Tables 5 and 6</ext-link>).

PPP1R15B is ubiquitously expressed (and well expressed in human islets and &#x3B2;-cells), consistent with the multisystem disease manifestations, while the other genes have a lower expression in islets and their pattern of tissue expression does not specifically correspond to the syndrome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db15-0477/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db15-0477/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 6</ext-link>).

It is located in the conserved COOH-terminal functional core of PPP1R15B that specifies interaction with PP1, the recruitment of the essential cofactor G-actin, and substrate-specific dephosphorylation (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In the cocrystal structure, PPP1R15B R658 inserts deep into a pocket on the surface of PP1 (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), giving rise to an ionic interaction with PP1 residue D71 that is conserved in other holophosphatases such as PP1-PPP1R10 (PNUTS) and PP1-PPP1R9B (spinophilin) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Collectively, these structural observations strongly support a critical role of R658 in PP1 binding and predict that the mutation of this residue has deleterious effects on protein function.</p>

        <title>R658C Mutation Destabilizes the PPP1R15B-PP1 Complex and Impairs eIF2&#x3B1; Dephosphorylation</title>
        <p>To study the effect of the R658C mutation on PPP1R15B function, we generated a plasmid encoding the fusion of WT or R658C-mutated human PPP1R15B to EGFP. HEK293T cells were transfected with either plasmid or the empty pEGFP vector, alone or in combination with a plasmid expressing mouse PP1A. The PPP1R15B-PP1 complex was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-GFP antibody and analyzed for the presence of PP1 by Western blot. Fewer PP1 were recovered in complex with mutant PPP1R15B-EGFP compared with WT. This was true both when endogenous PP1 was examined (compare lanes 1 and 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>) and when PP1A was overexpressed (compare lanes 5 and 6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>), demonstrating that the R658C mutation reduced the ability of PPP1R15B to bind PP1, as suggested by the structural studies.</p>

        <p>Next, we examined the dephosphorylation activity of the immunopurified PPP1R15B-PP1 holophosphatase complex. Complexes recovered by immunopurification of GFP-tagged WT PPP1R15B were more active at dephosphorylating eIF2&#x3B1; in vitro than complexes constituted of the R658C mutant (compare lanes 4 and 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). These differences were rendered more conspicuous in a time course study. Complexes containing WT PPP1R15B substantially dephosphorylated eIF2&#x3B1; protein by 45 min, whereas in dephosphorylation reactions carried out with R658C mutant PPP1R15B, substantial amounts of phosphorylated eIF2&#x3B1; remained even at the 60-min time point (compare lanes 7 and 12, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>). Thus, the missense mutation R658C negatively affects the stability of the PPP1R15B-PP1 complex and, in turn, its ability to dephosphorylate eIF2&#x3B1;.</p>

            <p>PPP1R15B deficiency sensitizes &#x3B2;-cells to FFA- and ER stress&#x2013;induced apoptosis and activates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis via DP5, PUMA, and Bim-S. INS-1E (<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>) or primary rat &#x3B2;-cells (<italic>C</italic>) were transfected with a control siRNA (siCT) or two different siRNAs targeting PPP1R15B (siP1R15B1 and siP1R15B2). After a 24-h transfection, the cells were exposed or not (CT) to CPA, oleate (OL), or palmitate (PAL) for 16 (<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>) or 24 h (<italic>C</italic>) (<italic>n</italic> = 4&#x2013;5). <italic>D</italic>: Mitochondrial cytochrome c (Cyto C) release was detected by Western blot in the cytoplasmic fraction 48 h after PPP1R15B knockdown. The right lane shows a noncytoplasmic fraction that includes mitochondria (Mito). Cox IV was used as a mitochondrial control and &#x3B2;-actin as a cytoplasmic control. Activation of caspase-9 (Casp9) (<italic>E</italic>) and caspase-3 (Casp3) (<italic>F</italic>) was detected by Western blot 48 h after PPP1R15B knockdown. &#x3B2;-Actin and &#x3B1;-tubulin were used as loading controls. <italic>D</italic>, <italic>E</italic>, and <italic>F</italic> are representative blots of 4&#x2013;5 experiments. The densitometry data were normalized to the highest value. DP5 (<italic>G</italic>) and PUMA (<italic>H</italic>) mRNA expression were measured by real-time PCR and corrected for the reference gene GAPDH (<italic>n</italic> = 4). Bim-S levels were measured by Western blot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db15-0477/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 2</ext-link>), corrected for &#x3B1;-tubulin, and expressed as fold of siCT (<italic>I</italic>) (<italic>n</italic> = 5). <italic>J</italic>: PPP1R15B was silenced alone or in combination with DP5, PUMA, or Bim, and apoptosis was examined by Hoechst 33342/propidium iodide staining (<italic>n</italic> = 3&#x2013;4). *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, ***<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, treated vs. control. #<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, ##<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, ###<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, siP1R15B vs. siCT. &#xA7;<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, single vs. double knockdown.</p>

        <p>To evaluate whether the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis was involved, we measured mitochondrial cytochrome c release to the cytoplasm and cleavage of caspase-9 and -3. In PPP1R15B-deficient INS-1E cells, cytoplasmic cytochrome c levels were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6<italic>D</italic></xref>) and caspase-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6<italic>E</italic></xref>) and -3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6<italic>F</italic></xref>) were cleaved, demonstrating activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.</p>
        <p>We next examined which BCL-2 family members activate the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. PPP1R15B deficiency induced mRNA expression of the proapoptotic proteins DP5 and PUMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6<italic>G</italic> and <italic>H</italic></xref>), but it did not significantly affect expression of Bim-S protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6<italic>I</italic></xref>). The expression of Bim-L and EL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db15-0477/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 2<italic>A</italic>&#x2013;<italic>C</italic></ext-link>) and the antiapoptotic proteins BCL-2 and BCL-XL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db15-0477/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 2<italic>D</italic>&#x2013;<italic>F</italic></ext-link>) were not modified by PPP1R15B deficiency. DP5, PUMA, or Bim silencing partially protected PPP1R15B-silenced &#x3B2;-cells from apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6<italic>J</italic></xref>), showing that PPP1R15B deficiency induces apoptosis through the proapoptotic BH3-only proteins DP5, PUMA, and Bim.</p>

      <p>R658C is the first reported mutation in <italic>PPP1R15B</italic>, responsible for a novel diabetes syndrome with onset in youth/young adulthood. It affects a key amino acid in the conserved C-terminus region of the protein that makes contacts with PP1 that is conserved in other holophosphatase complexes (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). We show that the R658C mutation destabilizes the complex between PPP1R15B and PP1, and this, in turn, diminishes eIF2&#x3B1; dephosphorylation. Furthermore, we show that PPP1R15B silencing alters &#x3B2;-cell function, inducing higher basal insulin secretion and reducing high glucose responsiveness, which is compatible with a role of PPP1R15B in exocytosis (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). This is consistent with the observation of residual C-peptide in the index patient and his moderate insulin requirement and frequent hypoglycemic events. PPP1R15B silencing also sensitizes &#x3B2;-cells to apoptosis, both under basal and ER stress conditions, which was induced via the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, as in the case of palmitate-induced eIF2&#x3B1; phosphorylation (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p>
      <p>Of note, diabetes manifested relatively late in these patients (at ages 15 and 28 years). Considering the congenital nature of the defect, this suggests the role of compensatory mechanisms that maintain a sufficient &#x3B2;-cell function for several years. The acute onset of diabetes suggests a threshold mechanism(s) by which this delicate balance is disrupted at some stage, as observed in autoimmune type 1 diabetes and other forms of monogenic diabetes, leading to hyperglycemia (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p>
      <p>The syndrome caused by the PPP1R15B-R658C mutation results in multisystem manifestations, affecting &#x3B2;-cells (diabetes), the nervous system (microcephaly, intellectual disability, and hearing loss), and bone (bone deformities) and general development. This phenotypic spectrum has interesting overlap with other mutations affecting the levels of ER stress or the response to it. Hence, &#x3B2;-cell dysfunction, bone abnormalities, microcephaly, and intellectual disability are shared with the Wolcott-Rallison syndrome caused by <italic>EIF2AK3</italic> mutations, which lead to higher levels of ER stress associated with less eIF2&#x3B1; phosphorylation (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), and with syndromes caused by mutations in the ER cochaperone <italic>DNAJC3</italic> and in the immediate early response 3 interacting protein 1 (<italic>IER3IP1</italic>), which both lead to higher levels of ER stress with more eIF2&#x3B1; phosphorylation (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). These commonalities likely reflect the importance of balanced ER protein synthesis and folding to the function of secretory cells, with insulin-producing &#x3B2;-cells, collagen-producing bone cells, and nerve cells especially vulnerable to imbalance. In the Wolcott-Rallison syndrome (with decreased eIF2&#x3B1; phosphorylation), neonatal diabetes is due to &#x3B2;-cell loss and C-peptide is undetectable (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), while <italic>DNAJC3, IER3IP1</italic>, and <italic>PPP1R15B</italic> mutations (with increased eIF2&#x3B1; phosphorylation) lead to permanent neonatal or young-onset diabetes with residual C-peptide levels, as reported by Synofzik et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), Shalev et al. (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), and the current study. It is notable that the mutations affecting the target of phosphorylated eIF2&#x3B1;, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B, feature prominent neurodegenerative manifestations known as the CACH (childhood ataxia with central nervous system hypomyelination)/VWM (vanishing white matter disease) syndrome (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), which are phenocopied by targeted activation of the eIF2&#x3B1; kinase PERK in the brain (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Interestingly, severe forms of CACH/VWM also have multiorgan manifestations (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The clinical variability of syndromes associated with dysregulated eIF2&#x3B1; phosphorylation likely results from the interplay of several factors, including the extent of apoptosis and/or secretory dysfunction resulting from specific genes mutations, the severity of the mutation, and possibly environmental stresses.</p>
      <p>The clinical features of <italic>PPP1R15B</italic>-mutated patients described here and the phenotype of knockout mice that we described previously (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) suggest that PPP1R15B deficiency affects multiple cell types. The role of PPP1R15B in exocytosis and membrane traffic has been previously reported in human epithelial cells and erythroleukemia cells (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The knockdown of PPP1R15B in breast cancer cells resulted in impaired cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase and apoptosis (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). These observations suggest that PPP1R15B regulates a variety of functions in different cell types. More studies are needed to explore this further.</p>
      <p>Although we selected <italic>PPP1R15B</italic> as an obvious candidate gene and found ample structural and functional experimental support for the impact of the mutation, we cannot formally exclude that one of the rare variants homozygous in the two affected siblings contributes to the syndrome. This hypothesis is unlikely based on the following reasons (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db15-0477/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 6</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db15-0477/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>): <italic>1</italic>) none of the other genes appear directly functionally relevant to the clinical presentation; <italic>2</italic>) the expression pattern of PPP1R15B, but not of the five other genes, is consistent with the multisystem presentation of the syndrome; <italic>3</italic>) mutations in <italic>ADAMTSL4</italic> cause ectopia lentis and mutations in <italic>FLG</italic> cause atopic dermatitis and ichtyosis vulgaris, and none of these diseases were present in the two affected siblings; and <italic>4</italic>) human or mouse disease phenotypes of <italic>KIF21B</italic>, <italic>SLC45A3</italic>, and <italic>UNC80</italic> mutations have not been reported so far, and a cellular phenotype of chromosome instability has been reported in Kif21b<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice, which was not observed in our patients. In short, the characteristics of these five other genes show little relevance to the diabetes and neurological phenotype of our patients.</p>
      <p>The present human genetic observations are in keeping with our earlier findings that excessive eIF2&#x3B1; phosphorylation is poorly tolerated by &#x3B2;-cells. Salubrinal, a chemical inhibitor of eIF2&#x3B1; dephosphorylation, was identified in a large-scale chemical screening as a compound that protects from ER stress (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), and it was even suggested as a potential therapy to preserve &#x3B2;-cells in diabetes (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). In rodent and human &#x3B2;-cells, however, salubrinal actually exacerbates cell death through ER stress and downstream activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The present observations support the concept that dysregulation of eIF2&#x3B1; phosphorylation, either excessive (<italic>PPP1R15B</italic>, <italic>DNAJC3</italic>, and <italic>IER3IP1</italic> mutations) or diminished (<italic>EIF2AK3</italic> mutations), is detrimental to &#x3B2;-cells, neurons, and bone and suggest that other proteins involved in the regulation of protein translation may lead to similar diabetes syndromes.</p>
