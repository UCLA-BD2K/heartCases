          <p>A substantial body of evidence supports the laparoscopic approach as the
preferred method for many procedures; yet, a majority of procedures today
still are performed by laparotomy. This preference for open procedures is
likely due to the lack of trained endoscopic surgeons, the difficulty in
obtaining proper instruments, and the long learning curve of operative
laparoscopy. The recent advent of computer-enhanced technology may provide
the bridge necessary for more surgeons to incorporate laparoscopic surgery
in the treatment of complex cases.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Endometriosis is a gynecologic disorder defined as the presence of endometrial glands
and stroma outside the uterine cavity. It affects as many as 15% of fertile
women and up to 50% of infertile women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref></sup> Endometriosis most commonly affects the pelvic organs. When
found outside the pelvis, it is termed extragenital or extrapelvic endometriosis.
The most common sites of extragenital endometriosis are the intestine and urinary
tract. Less commonly, endometriosis can affect distant sites including the lung and
diaphragm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Laparoscopic management of extensive extragenital endometriosis has been reported by
our group since the mid to late 1980s. (See Nezhat, C. Nezhat, F. Presentation of
Evaluation of safety of videolaparoscopic treatment of bowel endometriosis at
Scientific Paper and Poster Sessions, 44th Annual Meeting of the American Fertility
Society. October 8-13, 1988. Atlanta, Georgia).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref></sup> Recently,
robot-assisted laparoscopy has been used to manage pelvic endometriosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Using a computer-enhanced robotic system has multiple advantages. It provides a
3-dimensional view, excellent visualization of the surgical field, and tremor-free
movement. The simulation of an open surgical environment facilitates the successful
completion of complex procedures that are not otherwise easily accomplished
laparoscopically by less experienced surgeons. Thus, the robot can enable
laparoscopic surgical management of inherently complex procedures such as treatment
of severe extragenital endometriosis.</p>
      <p>Here, we report our experience with successful robotic-assisted laparoscopic
treatment of endometriosis of the bowel, bladder, and ureter in 5 patients. Although
standard laparoscopic management of this pathology has been reported since the late
1980s, it is not widely practiced. The addition of computer-enhanced technology may
facilitate the conversion of these procedures from laparotomy to laparoscopy. We
will describe our procedures and discuss the potential benefits afforded by robotics
in these cases.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="methods">
      <title>METHODS</title>
      <p>In each case, laparoscopy was assisted by the da Vinci Robotic Surgical System
(Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Our surgical techniques have been
described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref></sup> In summary, all patients were
placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. A Foley catheter was placed followed by
insertion of a HUMI uterine manipulator. Four laparoscopic ports were inserted: one
12-mm umbilical, two 8-mm midlateral, and one 5-mm to 12-mm suprapubic or one right
upper quadrant port. We began each procedure using standard laparoscopy with
subsequent introduction of the robot into the surgical field. During robot-assisted
laparoscopy, the primary surgeon controlled the robot remotely from the console,
which displayed a high-definition, highly magnified 3D image of the surgical field.
The suprapubic port was used by the assistant to provide ancillary laparoscopic
instruments as needed by the surgeon. Instruments used during the robotic procedures
included a needle holder, a monopolar hook, a suction/irrigator, a grasper, and
scissors. Additional equipment used during the laparoscopic portion of the
procedures included a vessel-sealing device, a CO<sub>2</sub> laser, a
suction/irrigator, a grasper, the Kleppinger bipolar system (Richard Wolf Medical
Instruments Corporation, Vernon Hills, IL), and/or the PlasmaJet energy system
(Plasma Surgical, Limited, Abingdon, Oxfordshire).</p>

        <title>CASE ONE</title>
        <p>Of the 2 patients with bowel endometriosis, the first underwent robotic-assisted
laparoscopic radical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and segmental
bowel resection, with reanastomosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref></sup> The
patient is a 41-year-old G1P1 with no medical comorbidities and a history of
severe endometriosis previously treated laparoscopically in 2000 and 2002. The
patient also underwent a cesarean delivery in 2003. She complained
preoperatively of diffuse pelvic pain, diarrhea, dyschezia, and dysmenorrhea
that had been relieved somewhat by prior surgical treatment but had
recurred.</p>
        <p>Upon entry with the laparoscope, we noted extensive adhesions of the rectum and
rectosigmoid colon to the uterus and adnexa, resulting in complete posterior
cul-de-sac obliteration. In addition, there was a stricture of the rectosigmoid
colon approximately 30cm from the dentate line. We performed a cystoscopy and
inserted ureteral catheters bilaterally before proceeding with the radical
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Our surgical techniques have
been described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref></sup>
We then mobilized the rectosigmoid colon down to the rectovaginal fascia. The
rectosigmoid segment and the distal sigmoid colon were severely foreshortened by
the large volume of surrounding fibrosis and endometriosis. Careful dissection
was carried laterally to mobilize the descending colon as well as a fibrotic
sigmoid endometrioma. The left ureter was identified, dissected, and left free
in the retroperitoneal space. The endometrioma and rectosigmoid segment were
shifted and retracted laterally. Dissection was continued to free the cuff of
the upper rectum, which was then divided with an Endo-GIA that had been placed
through the ancillary port. The mesocolon was also divided at the level of the
sigmoid colon in anticipation of reanastomosis. In sum, a 10-cm segment of the
rectosigmoid colon more than 30cm from the dentate line was removed. The
suprapubic incision was enlarged to 4cm, and the Alexis wound protector was
inserted. The excised rectosigmoid segment was removed through the enlarged
suprapubic incision. An EEA stapler was inserted into the rectum after
sufficient dilatation, and the rectal stump was reanastomosed to the sigmoid
colon. We ensured that there was no tension at the level of the anastomosis. The
proximal sigmoid colon was then obliterated by compression, and the anastomosis
was submerged under saline solution. The rectum was insufflated with air under
pressure to assure there was no leak. The patient did well after surgery and was
discharged on the third postoperative day. Pathology revealed severe bowel
endometriosis. This patient is doing well and is pain free 10 months later.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CASE TWO</title>
        <p>The second patient with bowel endometriosis underwent robotic-assisted
laparoscopic disc excision of the rectal wall.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref></sup> The patient is a 30-year-old G0 with a history of
congenital absence of the left kidney and left adnexa as well as unicornuate
uterus. She presented with constipation and dyschezia. Prior to our involvement
in her case, she had been evaluated for these symptoms and was found to have a
palpable mass on rectal examination. A colonoscopy revealed a 4-cm submucosal
mass approximately 10cm from the anal verge. An exploratory laparoscopy was
performed and confirmed the presence of severe endometriosis after which the
patient was referred to our center.</p>
        <p>Upon entry with the laparoscope, we noted evidence of complete posterior
cul-de-sac obliteration as well as a 4-cm saddle lesion on the anterior
rectosigmoid colon approximately 18cm from the dentate line and attached to the
posterior aspect of the vagina and unicornuate uterus. We proceeded with careful
dissection and mobilization of the rectosigmoid colon. Right and left pararectal
areas were entered laterally. Superiorly, we entered the presacral space at the
level of the sacral promontory, and inferiorly we entered the rectovaginal
space. This process was complicated by the severe nodularity and fibrosis
created by extensive endometriosis in this area. After mobilization, we excised
the lesion approximately 20cm from the dentate line using the da Vinci Robot
grasper and scissors. The excised portion of bowel measured 4.3cm in total. We
repaired the defect with multiple interrupted 2-0 Vicryl sutures using the da
Vinci Robot needle holders. Sigmoidoscopy was performed to confirm adequate
repair. Pathology revealed extensive endometriosis of the rectum, rectovaginal
septum, and bowel. Postoperatively, the patient is doing well and is pain free
12 months later.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CASE THREE</title>
        <p>Of the 2 patients with ureteral endometriosis, the first underwent
robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy and right ureteroneocystostomy with a
psoas hitch.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref></sup> The patient is a 49-year-old
G2P2 with no medical comorbidities who presented with diffuse pelvic pain,
dysmenorrhea, and significant genitourinary symptoms including urgency and
frequency.</p>
        <p>Upon entry with the laparoscope, we noted severe endometriosis of the posterior
cul-de-sac and lower portion of the broad ligament as well as evidence of
partial right hydroureter. We proceeded first with hysterectomy. Our surgical
technique has been described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref></sup> We then directed our attention to the extensive
endometriosis creating a stricture of the right ureter. We first mobilized the
ureter beginning approximately 7cm from the insertion of the ureter to the
bladder. Given the extensive disease burden in this area, we transected the
affected portion of the ureter and made a fish mouth incision using robotic
scissors. Retroperitoneal mobilization of the ureter was then carried up above
the pelvic brim. A bladder flap was developed, and the space of Retzius was
entered to complete mobilization. Three 1-0 interrupted delayed absorbable
sutures were placed through the bladder dome to the psoas tendon and were
secured. A cystotomy was then made in the dome of the bladder and a 0.38 Benson
guidewire was passed through this cystotomy into the intraperitoneal space and
then retrograde up the right ureter into the renal pelvis. The ureter was then
anastomosed to the bladder by using 4 interrupted, full-thickness 4-0
polydioxanone sutures placed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 o&#x2019;clock. These sutures
incorporated the serosa, muscularis, and mucosa of the bladder and ureter. The
ureteral stent was retained for 4 weeks. Pathology revealed severe endometriosis
of the uterosacral cardinal ligament complex and endometriosis of the right
ureter. Postoperatively, the patient is doing well and has been pain free for
over 4 years.</p>

        <title>CASE FOUR</title>
        <p>The second patient with endometriosis of the ureter also had severe endometriosis
of the left pelvic sidewall affecting the left external iliac artery and vein,
the left common iliac artery and vein, and the superior and inferior hypogastric
plexi. The patient is a 36-year-old G1 with chronic hypertension. She presented
with diffuse pelvic pain, constipation, dyspareunia, severe left lower quadrant
pain, and left lower extremity pain, swelling, and paresthesia. Given this
history, her physician had recommended life long anti coagulation therapy. The
patient presented to us after a previous attempt at curative open surgery had
been unsuccessful. Her surgeons had indicated that further attempts at surgical
treatment might result in loss of her leg or death. Prior to surgery, imaging
revealed an infiltrative soft tissue process within the left pelvis, which
exerted a mass effect upon the left ureter causing severe hydronephrosis and
hydroureter. A renal scan revealed severe cortical thinning and only 15%
remaining kidney function.</p>
        <p>The patient underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopic left nephrectomy, right
ureterolysis, resection of endometriosis of the rectovaginal septum, and removal
of endometriosis of the major vessels of the left pelvic wall. Upon entry with
the laparoscope, we noted extensive adhesions of the rectum and rectosigmoid
colon to the fundus of the uterus obliterating the posterior cul-de-sac and then
extending superiorly. We first proceeded with enterolysis and ureterolysis. The
left ureter was occluded 10cm from the ureterovesical junction. Superior to this
point, severe hydronephrosis was noted consistent with previous imaging. The
inferior obliterated portion of the left ureter was resected and a left simple
nephrectomy was performed. Multiple pathology specimens from the right and left
sidewalls, right ureteral serosa, the left ureter, the rectal bulb, the left
external iliac artery and vein, the left common iliac artery and vein, and the
bowel were positive for endometriosis. The excised left kidney had evidence of
chronic obstructive pyelonephritis. Postoperatively, after 8 months of
follow-up, the patient has done well. Her left lower extremity swelling and
numbness have resolved. She is pain-free and spontaneously achieved pregnancy 5
months after surgery. She delivered a healthy child in August 2011.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>CASE FIVE</title>
        <p>The final patient with endometriosis of the bladder underwent robotic-assisted
laparoscopic segmental bladder resection and repair. The patient is a
31-year-old G0 with no medical comorbidities who presented with frequency and
dysuria mostly during menses. The patient had no past surgical history.
Preoperatively, a cystoscopy was performed and confirmed the presence of a 2-cm
by 3-cm mass in the midline 3cm behind the intraureteric ridge.</p>
        <p>Upon laparoscopic entry, we noted an endometriotic lesion near the dome of the
bladder that corresponded to the lesion observed during cystoscopy. We then
proceeded with resection of this bladder mass. We first entered the
vesicovaginal space and mobilized the bladder posteriorly. We then entered the
right and left paravesical spaces as well as the space of Retzius to mobilize
the bladder anteriorly. The endometriotic nodule and a surrounding segment of
bladder, measuring 3.2cm in total, were removed. We then repaired the bladder
with a running stitch and then with multiple interrupted stitches of Vicryl
using da Vinci Robotic instruments. A cystoscopy was performed to confirm
adequate repair. Pathology revealed endometriosis of the bladder wall.
Postoperatively, the patient is doing well and is pain free after 12 months.</p>

      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>Despite early criticism, advanced operative laparoscopy is slowly replacing
laparotomy as the gold standard of operative management for a large proportion of
procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref></sup> Minimally invasive surgery has progressed to include
advanced procedures previously thought possible only by open incision. As early as
1988, our group successfully managed bowel endometriosis with laparoscopic
surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup> More recently, in 2010, a randomized comparison of
laparoscopically assisted versus open colectomy for colon cancer published in the
<italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic> demonstrated beneficial results
in favor of minimally invasive procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref></sup> There is now a substantial body of evidence to support the
laparoscopic approach as the preferred method for many procedures, including surgery
for malignancies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Despite the clear advantages of minimally invasive surgery, a majority of procedures
today still are performed by laparotomy. This preference for open procedures is
likely due to the lack of trained endoscopic surgeons, the difficulty in obtaining
proper instruments, and the long learning curve of operative laparoscopy.</p>
      <p>The recent advent of computer-enhanced technology, more sophisticated instruments and
better energy sources may provide the bridge necessary for surgeons to incorporate
laparoscopic surgery into their practice. The da Vinci Robot is one example of how
technology can assist in this regard. Since Nezhat's collaborative work with
robotic pioneers Ajit Shah and Phil Green of the Stanford Research Institute who
developed the Da Vinci robot in the 1990s, this technology has been successfully
applied to multiple fields. The robot enables visualization of the surgical field in
3 dimensions, eliminates tremors, has more wrist motions, and decreases the learning
curve for suturing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref></sup> all while
allowing the surgeon to sit. The advantages of the robot are especially useful to
the inexperienced laparoscopic surgeon during complex procedures such as those
described here. The addition of robotic assistance may lead more surgeons to adopt
minimally invasive techniques for complex cases when otherwise they might have
resorted to laparotomy. This is especially true in a training program such as ours.
The procedures described here require advanced laparoscopic suturing skills and thus
may not be feasible for fellows in training with more limited laparoscopic
experience. Robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery may shorten the learning curve for
these surgeons. Nevertheless, research to date has not shown superior patient
outcomes using computer enhanced technology (robotic assistance) when compared to
standard laparoscopy.</p>
      <p>The additional cost of the robot when compared to standard laparoscopy is not
negligible. This additional cost includes, not only the cost of the system itself
but also maintenance, the need for specially trained staff, and additional operating
room time. However, this cost might be outweighed by the benefit to the public in
general should robotic technology result in a greater proportion of cases being
performed by minimally invasive techniques with the potential result of shorter
hospital stays, decreased postoperative morbidity, and fewer recovery days away from
work. The cases reported here are some of the first examples of robot-assisted
laparoscopic treatment of multiorgan endometriosis involving the bowel, bladder, and
ureter. The patients in this series overall had favorable outcomes after treatment.
This would suggest that robotic assistance in the treatment of extragenital
endometriosis is feasible and safe. However, further randomized trials are needed to
fully assess the benefits afforded by robotic assistance in this patient
population.</p>
