<p><italic>Background:</italic> We report a youngwoman who developed septic shock after operative delivery in the 32nd week of
pregnancy.Clinical features, treatment modalities and prognosis of this high-mortality-rate disorder are presented
and discussed.</p>
<p><italic>Case:</italic> A 24-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1, was referred to our clinic in a confused state and immediately
admitted to our emergency unit. She apparently had eclampsia antenatally. Termination of pregnancy with
induction of labor and vacuum extraction had been employed in gestational week 32 of pregnancy. One day after
delivery, her clinical and laboratory parameters worsened, so she was referred to our clinic. After a thorough
physical examination and laboratory evaluation, the patient was diagnosed as having sepsis and disseminated
intravascular coagulation. After blood and urine cultures were taken, aggressive management included volume
repletion, antibiotics and positive inotropic therapy. Because she had persistent fever and unimproved laboratory
values despite these therapies, the uterus and ovaries were thought to be the source of sepsis, and total abdominal
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. Neither clinical nor laboratory parameters
improved, and the patient died 28 days after delivery as a result of respiratory failure.</p>
<p><italic>Conclusion:</italic> It is our purpose to emphasize that a rapid and appropriate decision for surgery may prevent the
maternal mortality in obstetric septic shock patients. Successful management depends on early identification and
aggressive treatment.</p>
