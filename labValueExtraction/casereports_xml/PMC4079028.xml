    <p><bold>Clinical data:</bold> It was reported, one month earlier, that after physical
exertion for three hours and at ambient temperature of 42&#xBA;C, symptoms of malaise and
tachycardia with precordial palpitations arose. At the moment, fibrilo-flutter atrial
with 160 bpm heart rate was diagnosed, which was reverted after administering endovenous
amiodarone. Initial diagnostic investigation revealed presence of atrial septal defect
(ASD) with 16mm diameter and surgical correction was indicated. Overall, the patient was
asymptomatic, in full physical and mental activity. No relevant morbid history was
reported.</p>
    <p><bold>Physical examination:</bold> Eupneic, acyanotic, normal pulse. Weight: 45 Kg,
Height: 158 cm, BP: 100/65 mmHg, HR: 82 bpm, saturation O<sub>2</sub> = 96%. Aorta was
not palpable at suprasternal notch.</p>
    <p>In the precordium, <italic>ictus cordis</italic> was not palpable and there were mild
systolic impulses on the left sternal border. Heart sounds were normophonetic and mild
systolic murmur was auscultated, + of intensity, rough, on the upper left sternal
border, without thrill. Liver was not palpable.</p>

      <p><bold>Electrocardiogram:</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>)
showed sinus rhythm and Full Right Bundle Branch Block (CRBBB) and Left Bundle
Branch Anterior Superior Hemiblock (LAHB). QRS complex duration was of 0.13' with
rsr' morphology in V1 and RS in V6, with negative T wave in V1 and V2. AP: +30&#xBA;,
AQRS: -30&#xBA;, AT: 0&#xBA;.</p>

Bi-Doppler Echocardiogram showed heart chambers with normal size and function. It
was visualized in multiple projections, in the middle of interatrial septum, an
aneurysm with convexity directed to the right, with a 20 mm distance in length
between borders, without interatrial communication. Transesophageal echocardiogram
confirmed this imaging, such as the magnetic nuclear resonance. There were no
myocardial abnormality and/or signs of fibrosis.</p>

      <p><bold>Clinical diagnosis:</bold> Interatrial septal aneurysm with full right bundle
branch block, left bundle branch anterior superior block in asymptomatic patient
with previous atrial fibrillation.</p>
      <p><bold>Clinical reasoning:</bold> Clinical elements were compatible with the diagnosis
initially established of ASD reporting a mild systolic murmur on the upper left
sternal border, along with CRBBB. Chest radiography, however, discarded this
possibility and especially the diagnostic imaging tests. It is worth noting that, in
the presence of ASD, both CRBBB and persistent or paroxysm atrial fibrillation
usually occur in adulthood and in defects with great repercussion, and LAHB is
rarely found in this context. Interatrial septal aneurysm is commonly found in
asymptomatic patients and causes no symptoms, except the possibility of progressive
thrombosis and systemic embolism in adulthood. With this analysis, heart murmur
found was reported as functional and other findings, characterized as congenital and
with genetic predisposition or acquired for episodes of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, which began recently.</p>
      <p><bold>Differential diagnosis:</bold> Anatomical and electrical findings without
clinical repercussion in this patient are not supported to characterize them as
belonging to an associated syndrome or a characteristic clinical profile because in
clinical practice we usually find them in isolated episodes. However, atrial
aneurysm is being recently found and reported in association with CRBBB and atrial
fibrillation in approximately 30% of cases. LAHB, on the other hand, is not
described in this association.</p>
      <p><bold>Conduct:</bold> Since the findings caused no repercussion, including
evolutionary problems in the short and medium term, the recommendation was for
regular follow-up without limitation of usual activities. Regarding the recent
atrial fibrillation, there was guidance on the use of adrenergic beta-blocker.</p>
      <p><bold>Comments:</bold> In children and young patients, findings in this case must be
seen as precursors of evolutionary problems that may arise after a few decades of
life. They are primarily represented by systemic embolisms as a result of atrial
thrombosis, arrhythmias such as atrial reentry tachycardia and paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, primarily in the presence of large atrial septal aneurysms. Therefore,
there is no need for concern at earlier ages. More accurate diagnostic aspects may
characterize this association as mutually dependent changes. Moreover, CRBBB in
childhood and teenagehood could be a relevant indicator to motivate the search for
abnormalities in atrial septum as it occurs in ASD, POF or aneurysm, changes found
in approximately 80% of these cases<sup><xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. In this context, it is unknown the association of LAHB, found
in this patient. It is considered for correcting atrial aneurysm, generally
percutaneous, when the patient is symptomatic in adulthood.</p>
