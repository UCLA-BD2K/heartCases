      <abstract>
        <p>Takotsubo syndrome is characterized by predominantly medial-apical transient left
ventricular dysfunction, which is typically triggered by physical or emotional
stress. The present article reports the case of a 61-year-old female patient
presenting with dizziness, excessive sweating, and sudden state of ill feeling
following an episode involving intense emotional stress. The physical examination and
electrocardiogram were normal upon admission, but the troponin I and creatine
kinase-MB concentrations were increased. Acute myocardial infarction without ST
segment elevation was suspected, and coronary angiography was immediately performed,
which showed severe diffuse left ventricular hypokinesia, medial-apical systolic
ballooning, and a lack of significant coronary injury. The patient was referred to
the intensive care unit and was successfully treated with supportive therapy. As this
case shows, Takotsubo syndrome might simulate the clinical manifestations of acute
myocardial infarction, and coronary angiography is necessary to distinguish between
both myocardial infarction and myocardial infarction in the acute stage. The present
patient progressed with spontaneous resolution of the ventricular dysfunction without
any sequelae.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Takotsubo syndrome, which was originally described in Japan in 1990,<sup>(<xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)</sup> represents a dyskinetic state of the
ventricular anterior wall with clinical manifestations similar to those of acute
coronary syndrome but without significant obstructive injury.</p>
      <p>The etiology of Takotsubo syndrome has not yet been established, and it might be
triggered by variable factors including stress. Stress involves increased catecholamine
levels, which might also cause ventricular dysfunction, as in
pheochromocytoma.<sup>(<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>Takotsubo syndrome occurs most frequently among women aged 60 to 75 years old. The
overall incidence is unknown, although it may be more prevalent than currently
reported.<sup>(<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</sup> Although
retrosternal chest pain is the most common symptom, some patients exhibit dyspnea,
shock, or electrocardiographic alterations.<sup>(<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>By definition, Takotsubo syndrome is a reversible acquired cardiomyopathy with favorable
prognosis in the absence of aggravating factors. Recovery of ventricular function occurs
approximately 18 days after the onset of symptoms, and treatment involves basic
hemodynamic support.<sup>(<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>The present article describes the case of a 61-year-old woman admitted to the emergency
department with dizziness, excessive sweating, and general ill feeling that began
suddenly following an episode of intense emotional stress.</p>

      <title>CASE REPORT</title>
      <p>A female patient aged 61 years old with a past history of diabetes, hypertension, and
total thyroidectomy three months earlier was admitted to the emergency unit presenting
with dizziness, excessive sweating, and general ill feeling that began suddenly
following an episode of intense emotional stress involving an event in which her son, a
cardiologist, was awarded a distinguished municipal decoration. She exhibited no
abnormal signs during the physical examination and the initial electrocardiogram but did
exhibit increased troponin I (8.22 ng/mL, reference value (RV)&lt;1.2), creatine
kinase-MB (15.3 ng/mL, RV&lt;6), and myoglobin (200 ng/mL, RV&lt;70) concentrations.
High-risk acute myocardial infarction (AMI) without segment ST elevation was the initial
clinical suspicion, and heart catheterization was immediately performed. The heart
characterization test showed that the left ventricle (LV) exhibited increased
end-diastolic volume and severe diffuse hypokinesia with ballooning of the medial-apical
heart segment during ventricular systole (dumbbell shape) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>), whereas the coronary arteries did not exhibit any
significant alteration.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>An electrocardiogram performed 12 hours after admission showed T-wave inversion on the
lateral and inferior walls. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU)
and was treated with aspirin, clopidogrel, and enalapril; inotropic support was not
necessary. The patient exhibited satisfactory progression without dyspnea, chest pain,
or signs of pulmonary or systemic congestion and adequate blood pressure levels.</p>
      <p>An echocardiogram was performed on day three at the ICU and showed considerable systolic
dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 23% (Teichholz method, RV: 5377%), systolic
shortening of 10.6% (RV: 27-46%), end-systolic volume of 78 mL (RV: 25-66 mL),
end-diastolic volume of 105 mL (RV: 51-154 mL), persistence of LV apical hypokinesis and
mild diastolic dysfunction due to (type I) ventricular relaxation impairment, pulmonary
arterial hypertension (estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure - PASP=35 mmHg), and
no relevant alterations in the heart valves. The levels of tissue necrosis markers
decreased with the normalization of the CKMB mass and troponin I concentration by the
end of day three (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

      <p>An echocardiogram performed on day six showed substantial improvement of systolic
function with an ejection fraction of 58% (Teichholz method) and normalization of the
other parameters. These data, along with the improvement of the clinical and laboratory
parameters, allowed the patient to be discharged at the end of day six. However, the
electrocardiogram performed at discharge still exhibited the same alterations of the
ventricular repolarization that were observed on day four.</p>
      <p>The patient was followed up as an outpatient using serial clinical and laboratory
assessments. No signs of later effects on ventricular performance or relapses were
observed.</p>

      <title>LITERATURE REVIEW</title>
      <p>Also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy, LV transient apical ballooning syndrome, or
broken heart syndrome, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a rare and recently described disease
that is receiving increasing attention from the international medical
community.<sup>(<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>That syndrome was first described in 1990 in Japan by Satoh et al.<sup>(<xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)</sup> In Japanese, "<italic>tako</italic>"
means octopus, and "<italic>tsubo</italic>" means earthenware pot; thus, the name of the
syndrome alludes to a fishing jar with a narrow neck and wide base used by fishermen to
trap octopuses. The shape of the jar is similar to the shape of the heart when affected
by Takotsubo syndrome in left ventriculography.</p>
      <p>From an epidemiological perspective, takotsuba syndrome is most frequently observed in
postmenopausal women (88.8% of cases). The patients usually present with the chest pain
typical of acute coronary syndrome, which is preceded in most cases by an episode
involving physical or emotional stress, such as a considerable argument, the death of a
loved one, natural disasters, legal problems, accidents, surgical procedures, a stay in
the ICU, and the use of illegal drugs.<sup>(<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>A European study estimated an overall prevalence of 1.2% of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy
among the patients initially diagnosed with AMI, which increased to 4.9% among
women.<sup>(<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)</sup> Data from the United
States indicate a prevalence 0.02% among all causes of hospital admission, and most of
the incidence corresponds to older women who are smokers and alcohol users and exhibit a
state of anxiety and hyperlipidemia.<sup>(<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)</sup> In a prospective cohort study with 136 consecutive patients, a
specific trigger was identified in 88% of the cases, the in-hospital death rate was 2%,
and the recurrence rate was 5%.<sup>(<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup> The
overall mortality rate of the sample was higher than that of the control, particularly
within the first year of follow-up.<sup>(<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>Segmental contraction disorders without significant coronary injury have been previously
described and are most frequently associated with myocarditis, coronary spasm,
pheochromocytoma, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The peculiar characteristics of Takotsubo
syndrome include the following: transient dyskinesia of the LV anterior wall, increased
ventricular base kinesis associated with chest pain, electrocardiographic alterations
ranging from ST segment elevation to discrete ventricular repolarization disorders, and
the absence of obstructive coronary disease.</p>
      <p>The physiopathology of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy remains unknown. Neuroendocrine,
hormonal, neuropsychological, and vascular causes have been proposed to explain the
pathogenesis of the condition. The theory positing a catecholamine-mediated myocardial
dysfunction is the most widely accepted.<sup>(<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>The following main diagnostic criteria for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy were established by
the Mayo Clinic in 2008: (1) apical LV ballooning with basal compensatory hyperkinesia
that does not follow the vascular territories on ventriculography or echocardiograms;
(2) fresh ischemic alterations in the electrocardiogram; (3) lack of angiographic signs
of significant obstruction of the epicardial coronary arteries or recent rupture of
atherosclerotic plaque; and (4) no recent history of head injury or intracranial
hemorrhage, pheochromocytoma, obstructive coronary disease, myocarditis, or hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.<sup>(<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup> Other data
that contribute to the positive diagnosis include disproportionately low heart marker
levels relative to the intensity of the ventricular dysfunction, quick improvement of
the LV dysfunction, and a history of recent and intense physical or emotional
stress.</p>
      <p>The differential diagnosis between acute coronary syndrome and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy
is a priori based on coronary angiography and ventriculography. However, many authors
are attempting to establish approaches to risk stratification. Kosuge et al.<sup>(<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup> analyzed the electrocardiogram patterns
upon admission and attempted to establish specific T-wave patterns to distinguish
between anterior wall AMI and Takotsubo syndrome. The results showed that the negative T
waves exhibited greater maximum amplitudes and more diffuse lead distribution. According
to those authors, the presence of positive T waves on aVR and the lack of negative T
waves on V1 exhibited 94.5% accuracy in the diagnosis of Takotsubo
cardiomyopathy.<sup>(<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup> These
findings might help identify the differences in the electrophysiological mechanisms
underlying the alterations and facilitate the differential diagnosis of Takotsubo
syndrome and AMI. However, the results still need to be confirmed.<sup>(<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>Noninvasive imaging assessment might provide important diagnostic information. For
example, echocardiography is important in diagnosis because it identifies the
medial-apical segmental alterations typical of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and provides
quantitative measures of the global LV systolic function.<sup>(<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup> As a function of its wide availability in the
in-hospital setting, echocardiography is usually the first test performed upon admission
to the emergency unit. Because it is performed at the bedside, echocardiograms allow
ventricular function to be monitored and the fast improvement of the abovementioned
alterations to be identified. </p>
      <p>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging might show increased signal intensity in the
T2-weighted sequences on the apical ventricular wall, which is suggestive of edema, does
not follow the vascular territories, and does not affect the basal areas. In addition,
the gadolinium dynamic studies usually do not indicate late enhancement, which is
compatible with myocardial necrosis, and might assist the differentiation from the
anterior wall AMI.<sup>(<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>The treatment of Takotsubo syndrome basically involves providing hemodynamic support and
controlling the possible complications, including cardiogenic shock (6.5% of cases),
intracavitary clot formation (3.8% of cases), heart failure (3.8% of cases), systemic
embolism, and ventricular arrhythmias.<sup>(<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>The available data are not sufficient to establish appropriate criteria for the
indication of primary and secondary prophylaxis against thromboembolism in Takotsubo
syndrome. According to an off-the-record recommendation based on observational studies,
to avoid ventricular clot formation, the patients should be subjected to full
anticoagulation over three months or until the recovery of the segmental
function.<sup>(<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)</sup> In the cases in
which clot formation occurs, the patients should be subjected to anticoagulation over
three to six months, independent of the status of the ventricular function.<sup>(<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>The prognosis of Takotsubo syndrome is good, and morphologic and functional recovery of
the myocardium occurs within one month (18 days on average). The mortality rate varies
from 0 to 8% with an average of 2%.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="discussion">
      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The patient's complaints were initially attributed to high-risk acute coronary syndrome
without ST segment elevation based on the clinical manifestations, present risk factors
(age, hypertension, and diabetes), increased heart enzyme levels, and a lack of
electrocardiographic alterations upon admission. Because of the initial hypothesis
suggested by emergency care, early coronary angiography was performed, as recommended by
the international guidelines. Thus, the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was
incidental in our case report. The present case report clearly illustrates the ability
of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy to mimic the signs and symptoms of myocardial injury and the
importance of considering Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the approach to patients with
acute chest pain in the emergency setting.</p>
      <p>The main aim of coronary angiography in this case is to rule out significant coronary
injury and identify the signs typical of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy to establish a
positive diagnosis. The following signs are significant: increased end-diastolic volume
and severe diffuse hypokinesia with ballooning of the medial-apical heart segment during
ventricular systole, which causes the heart to be shaped like a trapped octopus in a
fishing jar (<italic>Takotsubo</italic> in Japanese) as in the original description.</p>
      <p>The management of patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy involves strictly conservative
supportive treatment in the intensive care setting. The use of thrombolytic agents must
be systematically avoided because it is not justified by the etiopathogenesis of the
disease. LV depression may be treated using diuretics, beta blockers, and
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Beta blockers might also block the
excessive release of catecholamines and the mechanism putatively underlying Takotsubo
cardiomyopathy.<sup>(<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup></p>
      <p>In the present case report, although ventricular function was altered, and the
echocardiogram indicated reduction of the ejection fraction, the patient did not
progress into cardiogenic shock or exhibit relevant alterations of the heart valves in
which inotropic support was not needed. Acetylsalicylic acid (AAS), which is an ACE
inhibitor, and clopidogrel were prescribed on admission when the suspected diagnosis was
AMI. The remainder of the treatment involved a short stay at the ICU.</p>
      <p>The reversibility of the LV contractile disorder and the lack of significant obstructive
coronary disease are the primary diagnostic criteria of takotsuba syndrome, and the
ventricular functions fully recover approximately 18 days (varying from three to 50
days) after the onset of symptoms.<sup>(<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup>
The patient did not exhibit any complications, the hospital stay lasted six days before
the patient was discharged, and the clinical progression and echocardiographic findings
indicated spontaneous resolution of the ventricular dysfunction.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="conclusions">
      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an important cause of chest pain that should be considered
as a differential diagnosis because it might present clinically as acute coronary
syndrome. Positive diagnosis of the syndrome might be easily established using
characteristic imaging findings when the appropriated diagnostic tools are available.
Therefore, the coronary angiography once more establishes itself as of major
significance in this scenario.</p>
      <p>The patient described in this report is consistent with the data described in the
literature. The diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in patients presenting with
clinical manifestations of acute coronary syndrome should be considered, particularly in
postmenopausal women exposed to systemic stress conditions.</p>
